### [1] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net的扩散模型在文本到动作生成中存在语义不对齐和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高层特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，包含双路径锚定：时间域的MoCLIP对比学习模型提供语义监督，频率域的低频DCT分量提供补充对齐信号，通过时间调制机制自适应融合。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别达到0.035和0.123的FID分数，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了文本到动作生成中的语义对齐问题，是一个高效可扩展的高保真解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准，包含2,720个问题-答案对，专门测试视觉语言模型在密集场景中的基础视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准通常关注全局图像理解，高估了VLMs的性能。作者认为编码和推理细节对VLMs仍然是挑战，特别是在密集场景中。

Method: 使用高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描图像，这些图像包含多个人物、动作和详细背景。手动标注了六个任务类别的问题来全面测试场景理解。

Result: 测试了37个模型，最好的模型(o3)在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，在所有问题上平均准确率为69.5%。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型的关键差距，为社区开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习框架来编辑视频中的生理信号，同时保持视觉保真度，以解决基于摄像头的HR估计带来的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的生理信号估计虽然方便，但面部视频中的生命体征会泄露敏感的个人健康信息，引发严重的隐私担忧。

Method: 使用预训练的3D VAE编码输入视频，通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标HR提示，使用可训练的时空层和AdaLN融合特征，在解码器中应用FiLM和微调输出层来避免生理信号退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，HR调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效保护视觉质量的同时准确调制生理信号，可用于匿名化生物特征信号或合成具有期望生命体征的真实视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的认知基准测试，专注于视角转换中的空间推理挑战，包含平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化等细粒度诊断类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在系统性弱点，如强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差以及在对称和句法重构下的不一致性，需要专门的诊断工具来评估和改进这些能力。

Method: 设计围绕视角转换核心挑战的基准测试，包含逐步结构化的诊断类别，从单物体简单任务到多物体视角转换的最具挑战性设置，评估了37个最先进的专有和开源视觉语言模型。

Result: 人类受试者达到91.2%的高准确率，而视觉语言模型表现出系统性弱点。任务难度与人类响应时间强相关，表明SpinBench捕捉到了人类和视觉语言模型共享的空间推理挑战。扩展分析显示平滑改进和新兴能力。

Conclusion: SpinBench为视觉语言模型的空间推理提供了关键见解，突出了它们在物理空间推理能力方面的关键差距，是评估和改进模型空间推理能力的重要工具。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多模态时空Transformer（MM-STT）框架，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，显著提升了高分辨率地面沉降预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长期依赖关系，且局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息进行地面沉降预测。

Method: 设计多模态时空Transformer，采用联合时空注意力机制统一处理多模态特征，实现深度多模态融合。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上达到新的最先进水平，长期预测RMSE比基线方法降低一个数量级，显著优于STGCN和STAEformer等方法。

Conclusion: 对于地面沉降预测这类问题，架构对深度多模态融合的内在能力是实现突破性性能的关键。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs可以通过文本交互灵活处理视觉任务，但在3D理解方面表现不佳。本文提出的DepthLM方法通过视觉提示和相机参数增强，使VLMs在深度估计任务上达到专家级精度，无需改变架构或损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的VLMs在从2D输入理解3D方面仍有困难，而专门的视觉模型在深度估计等3D任务中能达到超人类精度。本文旨在探索VLMs是否能在不改变架构或损失函数的情况下达到专家级精度。

Method: 采用基于文本的监督微调与稀疏标签，结合视觉提示和相机参数条件增强来解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊问题。无需密集预测头或复杂的回归/正则化损失。

Result: DepthLM方法使用更小的模型，在精度上超越了最先进VLMs的2倍以上，首次使VLMs与纯视觉模型相媲美。同时自然避免了过平滑问题，在边界区域比纯视觉模型有更少的飞点。

Conclusion: DepthLM的简洁性使单个VLM能够覆盖除度量深度之外的各种3D任务，证明了VLMs通过适当方法可以达到专家级的3D理解能力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯Transformer的泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化方法，融合Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2数据，能够生成高分辨率海冰浓度图和可靠的uncertainty map。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泛北极高分辨率海冰制图及其不确定性量化对海冰业务制图至关重要，但由于海冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而难以实现。

Method: 1) 设计具有全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型以更好识别海冰模式差异；2) 将模型参数作为随机变量构建贝叶斯Transformer以改进不确定性量化；3) 在决策层融合三种不同类型数据（Sentinel-1、RCM、AMSR2）。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试，相比其他不确定性量化方法，所提模型能够同时获得高分辨率海冰浓度图和鲁棒的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯Transformer方法能够有效解决泛北极海冰制图中的关键挑战，实现高精度海冰浓度制图和可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 融合路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器，采用卡尔曼滤波后期融合策略，在复杂道路环境中实现精确车辆检测和定位，显著降低纵向误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施感知在复杂道路环境（如施工区）中面临的透视失真、几何复杂、遮挡和成本等部署障碍。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，开发可扩展的车辆检测定位框架，采用基于卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略。

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差降低达70%，横向精度保持在1-3米内；现场验证显示融合轨迹能准确匹配真实车辆路径，即使单传感器数据中断或降级。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波传感器融合能可靠补偿单个传感器限制，为复杂交通环境提供精确鲁棒的车辆跟踪能力，是实现基础设施多传感器系统主动安全措施的有效途径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先感知后推理"的新范式解决MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中的性能不佳问题，强调增强模型对伪造痕迹的视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中表现不佳，根源在于视觉编码器主要针对语义识别优化，对低级别伪造痕迹不敏感，且微调数据格式与预训练分布不匹配，导致模型依赖语言捷径而非真实视觉证据。

Method: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，采用"先感知后推理"范式：首先训练MLLMs感知伪造痕迹，增强其伪影感知视觉能力，使后续推理基于实际观察；同时提出ExplainFake-Bench基准从五个关键方面评估MLLMs在图像取证中的可解释性。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在泛化性和真正可靠的可解释性方面具有优越性，能够保持多轮对话能力的同时实现准确的假图像检测。

Conclusion: 通过强化MLLMs的伪影感知视觉能力，使其能够基于真实视觉证据进行推理，是解决AI生成图像检测问题的有效途径，提出的方法在泛化性和可解释性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [10] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视线追踪技术实时检测视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析视线模式来识别无法模仿人类微妙非语言交流的深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时网络钓鱼攻击。由于深度伪造无法模仿人类在对话中的微妙视线交流模式，这为检测提供了机会。

Method: 基于对二元对话中视线模式研究的可解释特征构建模型，利用恶意行为者视频流中的估计视线来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自建数据集上测试，准确率达到82%，这是首个利用视线追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法。

Conclusion: 视线追踪技术可以有效检测实时深度伪造攻击，为视频会议安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的6自由度物体姿态估计算法，专门用于火星样本返回任务中的低功耗硬件环境，通过自定义渲染器和新的模板匹配度量实现鲁棒姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机械臂在严格硬件限制下对多个目标物体进行低间隙拾取和插入时的定位问题。

Method: 使用自定义渲染器和针对边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅需低精度、无纹理的3D模型作为输入。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星现场图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [12] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一个结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型的混合管道，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称接地问题，在Talk2Car基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称接地具有挑战性，因为场景变化大、视觉相似物体多、动态元素复杂，使得解析自然语言引用（如"右边的黑色汽车"）变得困难。

Method: 提出LLM-RG混合管道，结合现成的视觉语言模型进行细粒度属性提取和大型语言模型进行符号推理。通过LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，用VLM生成丰富的视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据结合成自然语言提示，输入LLM进行思维链推理来识别指称对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升。消融实验表明添加3D空间线索能进一步改进接地效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果证明了视觉语言模型和大型语言模型在零样本方式下对于鲁棒的户外指称接地具有互补优势。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VISOR++方法，通过优化的视觉输入实现多模态视觉语言模型的行为控制，无需运行时访问模型内部，适用于开源和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限：系统提示易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式运行时模型访问，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。需要开发跨模型通用的转向方法。

Method: VISOR++通过生成优化的视觉输入来诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制。该方法可为多个VLM生成单一转向图像，无需运行时模型访问。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等开源模型上，VISOR++图像在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上达到与转向向量相当的性能。对未见模型也显示出行为转向潜力，同时在14,000个无关MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，通过视觉输入实现多模型行为转向，为安全关键应用中的VLM行为控制提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的视觉语言模型自改进框架，通过任意图像生成竞争性视觉游戏来训练模型，在推理、图表问答等任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法依赖劳动密集型数据集，训练成本高，限制了视觉语言模型的实际部署。需要解决人工标注依赖问题。

Method: 提出战略自玩框架，让模型在"谁是卧底"式游戏中扮演多个角色进行战略推理；从任意图像生成游戏；引入迭代自玩策略优化算法。

Result: 尽管使用无标签数据，在推理、图表问答和视觉中心理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越其他基于标注的方法。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了通过游戏化自玩框架实现视觉语言模型自改进的可行性，无需人工标注即可获得持续性能提升。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合数学/聚类分割模型和U-Net的混合方法，用于脉络膜痣的精确分割，在1024*1024眼底图像上达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，优于Attention U-Net模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉络膜痣有转化为黑色素瘤的风险，早期检测至关重要。现有AI诊断方法面临图像分辨率低、标注不一致等挑战，需要开发更精确的分割模型来支持临床诊断。

Method: 将数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net相结合，利用两种方法的优势，减少对大规模训练数据的依赖，提高分割精度。

Result: 在1024*1024眼底图像上，混合模型达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，显著优于Attention U-Net的51.3%和34.2%，并在外部数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该混合模型为脉络膜痣诊断决策支持系统提供了基础，有望通过自动病变标注提高诊断和监测的速度与准确性。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Conclusion: FishNet++基准为开发能够推进水生科学的专用视觉语言模型提供了全面的评估资源，解决了现有模型在专业科学领域的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development

Motivation: 现有的视觉图神经网络缺乏能够有效捕捉复杂节点-邻居关系且无需架构特定优化的通用聚合方法。

Method: 提出交叉注意力聚合方法，其中查询投影来自节点，键投影来自邻居；并构建AttentionViG架构进行非局部消息传递。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在MS COCO 2017的目标检测、实例分割以及ADE20K的语义分割任务中表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率，在与先前视觉GNN架构相当的FLOPs下提供有竞争力的准确率。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaChest数据集和评估框架，研究医学图像中的广义少样本多标签分类问题，发现迁移学习方法优于专门设计的少样本学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺，需要从少量样本中学习新类别，同时利用已有类别知识，这更符合广义少样本分类场景。

Method: 构建包含479,215张胸片的大规模数据集MetaChest，设计标准少样本分类元集划分和多标签episode生成算法，评估迁移学习和ProtoNet扩展方法。

Result: 增加每episode类别数和每类训练样本数可提升性能；迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet；高分辨率图像提高精度但增加计算成本；高效架构可达到类似性能且显著减少资源需求。

Conclusion: 在医学图像少样本多标签分类中，简单的迁移学习方法比专门设计的少样本学习方法更有效，同时需要在精度和计算效率之间权衡。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

TL;DR: K-Prism是一个统一的医学图像分割框架，通过整合语义先验、上下文知识和交互反馈三种知识范式，实现了跨任务、模态和器官的灵活分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型通常针对单一知识源和特定任务设计，与临床实践中专家整合多种知识（解剖先验、参考案例推理、实时交互）的现实形成鲜明对比。

Method: 将异构知识源编码为双提示表示：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过混合专家解码器动态路由，支持三种知识范式的灵活切换和联合训练。

Result: 在18个公共数据集（涵盖CT、MRI、X射线、病理学、超声等多种模态）上的综合实验表明，K-Prism在语义、上下文和交互分割设置下均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism成功模拟了临床实践的灵活性，通过统一框架整合多种知识范式，为医学图像分割提供了更接近真实临床需求的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本文本-图像组合检索中准确捕捉用户意图的挑战，避免任务特定训练和标注数据的需求。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）语义查询增强融合阶段，用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富CLIP查询嵌入；2）高效批量重排序阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE以其简单有效的方式在零样本文本-图像组合检索中实现了强大性能，展示了实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Motivation: 人类感知具有主动聚焦特性，需要针对关键区域进行按需细节重建。现有3DGS方法要么输出均匀分辨率导致计算成本高，要么需要密集观测和离线优化，无法充分利用高分辨率图像

Method: 基于低分辨率3DGS重建，使用前馈致密化框架融合多模态信息，设计像素引导的致密化机制来捕获大分辨率增加下的细节

Result: 在局部精细细节重建方面表现优异，能够扩展到1024×1024分辨率图像，具有强可扩展性

Conclusion: 该方法避免了均匀高分辨率重建的高成本和冗余，充分利用关键区域的高分辨率捕获，实现了高效的局部细节重建

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Result: 评估显示既有希望也有局限性。在零样本设置下，表现最佳的模型在疾病筛查中达到约58%的准确率，但对于疾病分期等挑战性任务，性能仍然不理想。

Conclusion: 将公开发布数据集、整理流程和排行榜，以推动眼科AI应用的发展，减轻威胁视力疾病的全球负担。

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

TL;DR: 提出AFGeo方法，一种无需预定义锚点的跨视角目标地理定位框架，通过直接预测边界框偏移和引入高斯位置编码来应对跨视角定位中的位置不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角目标地理定位方法大多基于锚点机制，这种预定义锚点的约束限制了方法的灵活性。为了消除这种依赖，需要开发锚点无关的定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接预测每个像素到真实边界框的四个方向偏移（左、右、上、下），无需预定义锚点。引入高斯位置编码（GPE）建模查询图像中的点击点位置不确定性，并设计跨视角目标关联模块（CVOAM）关联不同视角下的相同目标及其上下文。

Result: 该方法在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时模型轻量且计算高效，参数开销最小。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过锚点无关的定位范式，结合GPE和CVOAM，有效解决了跨视角目标地理定位中的位置不确定性和外观差异问题，取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-DLC任务，用于遥感图像的对象级细粒度描述，构建了DE-Dataset数据集和DE-Benchmark评估套件，并开发了DescribeEarth模型，在遥感图像描述任务上优于现有通用MLLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感图像描述研究主要关注图像级别，缺乏对象级细粒度解释，无法充分利用遥感图像中丰富的语义和结构信息。

Method: 提出DescribeEarth多模态大语言模型架构，集成尺度自适应聚焦策略和领域引导融合模块，利用遥感视觉语言模型特征编码高分辨率细节和遥感类别先验，同时保持全局上下文。

Result: DescribeEarth模型在DE-Benchmark上持续优于最先进的通用MLLM，在事实准确性、描述丰富性和语法正确性方面表现优异，特别是在捕捉内在对象特征和周围环境属性方面。

Conclusion: Geo-DLC任务和DescribeEarth模型为遥感图像的对象级细粒度描述提供了有效解决方案，在简单、复杂甚至分布外遥感场景中均表现出色。

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

*Po-Heng Chou,Chun-Chi Wang,Wei-Lung Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的深度学习模型用于工业制造中的自动缺陷检测，结合ConSinGAN进行数据增强，YOLOv9模型表现最佳，准确率达91.3%，检测时间146ms，并集成到SCADA系统中建立自动化光学检测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中人工检测金属板缺陷耗时耗力的问题，以及金属板图像数据不足导致检测精度下降的挑战。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量数据增强，比较四种YOLO模型版本（v3、v4、v7、v9）的性能，并将最佳模型集成到制造硬件和SCADA系统中。

Result: YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN表现最优，准确率达到91.3%，检测时间为146毫秒，成功建立实用的自动化光学检测系统。

Conclusion: 提出的YOLOv9模型结合数据增强方法能有效解决工业缺陷检测问题，且易于扩展到其他工业制造组件的检测任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

### [28] [OmniDFA: A Unified Framework for Open Set Synthesis Image Detection and Few-Shot Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25682)
*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniDFA框架，用于AI生成图像检测和少样本来源识别，构建了包含117万张图像的大型数据集OmniFake。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成图像检测方法容易过拟合特定伪造特征，而来源识别方法受限于缺乏大规模分类数据集，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出开放集少样本来源识别新范式，开发OmniDFA框架，既能评估图像真实性，又能以少样本方式确定合成来源。

Result: OmniDFA在开放集来源识别方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OmniDFA为AI生成图像检测和来源识别提供了有效的解决方案，构建的数据集将促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

### [29] [AIMCoT: Active Information-driven Multimodal Chain-of-Thought for Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25699)
*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AIMCoT框架，通过主动信息驱动的多模态思维链方法，解决了现有方法在视觉-语言推理中的局限性，显著提升了多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式规则构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但经验分析表明这些方法不可靠。其被动无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型认知需求方面存在严重不足。

Method: AIMCoT包含三个协同组件：(1) 上下文增强注意力图生成(CAG)，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡问题；(2) 主动视觉探测(AVP)，基于信息理论主动选择最能帮助回答问题的图像区域；(3) 动态注意力转移触发(DAT)，通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移，智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上进行广泛实验，证明AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态构建推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理迈出的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [30] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散模型记忆训练数据的核心机制：早期去噪过程中的过度估计导致多样性减少、去噪轨迹坍缩，并加速向记忆图像收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得成功，但会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有研究未能从根本上解释记忆现象的发生原因和机制。

Method: 通过重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜在空间动态，研究训练样本在早期去噪阶段的过度估计如何驱动记忆现象。

Result: 发现：(i)记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，训练损失在记忆时反而更大；(ii)记忆提示将训练图像注入噪声预测，强制潜在轨迹收敛；(iii)中间潜在分解显示初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容取代。

Conclusion: 早期过度估计是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制，偏离理论去噪计划与记忆严重程度高度相关。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

### [31] [ProbMed: A Probabilistic Framework for Medical Multimodal Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25711)
*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED是一个多模态医学视觉语言预训练模型，使用概率对比学习来建模嵌入分布，将四种医学模态（胸部X光、心电图、超声心动图和临床文本）对齐到统一的概率嵌入空间中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言预训练模型未能直接处理医学信息中普遍存在的多对多映射关系，需要一种能够建模概率分布而非确定性估计的方法。

Method: 采用概率对比学习，使用InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合模态间分布，引入概率合成采样损失来捕获模态特定的均值和方差，改善模态内绑定。

Result: 在13个医学数据集上的实验表明，该模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务上优于现有Med-VLPMs，并展示了多模态整合在预后预测中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率建模方法有效改善了医学多模态数据的表示学习，在多种任务上表现出色，为医学决策提供了更好的多模态整合能力。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

### [32] [Importance Sampling for Multi-Negative Multimodal Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25717)
*Xintong Li,Chuhan Wang,Junda Wu,Rohan Surana,Tong Yu,Julian McAuley,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO是一个多模态偏好优化框架，通过引入多个语义多样的负样本和Plackett-Luce模型来解决现有方法依赖简单成对比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态DPO方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性检索生成单个负图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器揭示语义偏差为可解释因子。基于重构难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本。采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略处理多负样本比较。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试上的实验表明，MISP-DPO在提高多模态对齐方面持续优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 验证了语义感知的多负样本采样在基于偏好的学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE提出了一种统一的视觉地点识别训练框架，通过联合改进局部特征聚合、训练样本组织和困难样本挖掘，增强空间-视觉判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注描述符微调或固定采样策略，忽视了训练过程中空间上下文和视觉相似性之间的动态交互作用。

Method: 引入轻量级Soft Probing模块学习补丁描述符的残差权重，构建在线地理-视觉图融合地理邻近性和当前视觉相似性，使用贪心加权团扩展采样器聚焦信息量最大的地点邻域。

Result: 在8个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland上分别获得98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%的Recall@1。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态空间-视觉交互建模和参数高效微调，显著提升了视觉地点识别的性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LaTo方法，通过地标标记化实现细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，解决了现有方法在精确属性控制和身份保持方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的人脸编辑模型在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难，特别是当条件地标与源图像差异较大时（如大表情或姿态变化、不准确的地标估计），刚性几何约束会降低身份保持效果。

Method: 提出LaTo方法，包括：1）地标标记器将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记；2）位置映射位置编码整合面部和图像标记；3）利用视觉语言模型从指令和源图像推断目标地标的地标预测器。

Result: 在身份保持方面比现有最优方法提升7.8%，在语义一致性方面提升4.6%。构建了HFL-150K数据集，包含超过15万真实人脸对和细粒度指令。

Conclusion: LaTo方法通过地标标记化和结构化思维链，实现了更好的身份保持和语义一致性，为人脸编辑提供了更精确的控制能力。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决复杂现实场景下视频对象分割的挑战，包括长期对象消失重现以及小型不明显对象的存在

Method: 冻结SAM2的特征提取器，微调其他组件；推理阶段引入像素检查策略，利用多模型互补优势逐步优化预测

Result: 在MOSEv1挑战赛测试集上获得86.37%的J&F分数，排名第一

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对复杂场景下视频对象分割任务的挑战

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SO(3)扩散模型的人体网格恢复方法，通过建模3D旋转参数的分布来处理单目RGB图像中人体姿态恢复的固有模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体网格恢复方法大多回归单一确定性输出，无法有效处理2D到3D映射的固有模糊性。概率方法虽然尝试生成多个可能输出，但在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成3D旋转参数的分布，通过条件丢弃实现无条件和图像条件生成。利用transformer学习人体关节的层次结构，使用小型MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的每关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够有效预测准确的人体姿态概率分布。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够建模与2D观测对齐的分布，解决了现有方法在准确性和多样性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoDrag是一种基于几何引导的拖拽式图像编辑方法，通过结合3D几何线索和2D空间先验，解决了传统2D编辑方法在几何密集型场景中的不精确和不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拖拽式图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 提出了统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验，并引入无冲突分区策略来隔离编辑区域，防止干扰并确保一致性。

Result: 在各种编辑场景中的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，显示出优越的精度、结构一致性和可靠的多点编辑能力。

Conclusion: GeoDrag能够实现连贯、高保真且结构一致的图像编辑，在单次前向传播中完成，解决了传统方法在几何密集型编辑中的局限性。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

TL;DR: IPDRecon是一个基于图像平面解码的室内场景重建框架，通过利用单视图内的空间信息而非多视图几何约束，显著提升了在视图数量减少时的重建稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法严重依赖多视图像素反投影射线交集的几何约束，导致重建质量对输入视图密度敏感，在重叠区域和未观测区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出IPDRecon框架，包含三个核心组件：像素级置信度编码器（PCE）、仿射补偿模块（ACM）和图像平面空间解码器（IPSD），通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon在视图数量减少40%时仍能保持几乎相同的重建质量，变异系数仅为0.24%，性能保持率达99.7%，最大性能下降仅0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用单视图内空间信息为实际应用中视图受限场景提供了鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了重建的视图不变性。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited

TL;DR: 评估多模态大语言模型在金融短视频主题对齐字幕生成中的表现，测试了7种模态组合在5个主题上的性能，发现视频单独表现强劲，某些双模态组合优于全模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立金融短视频字幕生成的基准，探索多模态模型在复杂视觉线索理解中的潜力和挑战。

Method: 使用624个标注的YouTube短视频，测试7种模态组合（T、A、V、TA、TV、AV、TAV）在5个主题上的表现。

Result: 视频单独在4个主题上表现强劲；某些双模态组合（如TV、AV）优于全模态TAV；过多模态可能引入噪声。

Conclusion: 建立了金融短视频字幕生成的第一个基准，展示了多模态模型在该领域的潜力和挑战，特别是视觉模态的重要性。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量引导扩散的虚拟试穿框架，通过线性逆问题重构和轨迹对齐求解器，有效解决非试穿区域的身份和背景保持问题，消除边界伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在保持非试穿区域（身份和背景）方面存在挑战，后处理策略直接替换这些区域会导致边界伪影。需要一种能够渐进式保持测量一致性的方法。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重构为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器。提出基于残差先验的初始化来缓解训练-推理不匹配，以及无伪影测量引导采样，结合数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保持身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性上优于现有最优基线方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的非试穿区域保持问题，为高质量虚拟试穿提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了文本偏好优化(TPO)框架，无需配对图像偏好数据即可实现文本到图像模型的"免费午餐"对齐，通过训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示来改进文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习方法依赖成本高昂的人工标注和配对图像偏好数据，存在可扩展性限制，需要一种更高效的对齐方法。

Method: 使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示，扩展DPO和KTO算法为TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TPO方法在人类偏好评分和文本-图像对齐方面始终优于原始方法。

Conclusion: TPO框架提供了一种无需配对图像偏好数据的有效对齐方法，具有良好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

TL;DR: v-HUB是一个新的视觉中心视频幽默理解基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力。实验发现MLLMs在纯视觉幽默理解上存在困难，而音频的加入有助于提升表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力对于提升人机交互体验具有重要意义，但目前缺乏专门针对视觉幽默理解的评估基准。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含来自经典默片和在线资源的非语言短视频，配有丰富注释，支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并构建开放式视频问答任务。

Result: 实验结果显示MLLMs仅通过视觉线索理解幽默存在困难，从文本到视频评估时性能显著下降。音频的加入有助于视频幽默理解，表明声音信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在纯视觉幽默理解方面仍有挑战，整合更丰富的模态对于复杂视频理解任务具有前景。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCPO框架来解决文本到图像模型强化学习中的训练不稳定问题，通过比例信用分配机制显著加速收敛并提升图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并影响图像质量，主要原因是生成采样器的数学结构导致跨时间步的信用分配不成比例

Method: 引入比例信用策略优化(PCPO)框架，通过稳定的目标重构和原则性的时间步重加权来强制执行比例信用分配

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，加速了收敛速度，产生了更高质量的图像，并在所有方面大幅优于现有策略梯度基线，包括最先进的DanceGRPO

Conclusion: 比例信用分配是解决文本到图像模型强化学习训练不稳定问题的关键，PCPO通过纠正不成比例的信用分配有效缓解了模型崩溃这一常见失败模式

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ENM Inversion方法，通过搜索最优噪声图来平衡内容保持和编辑能力，解决了现有文本引导图像编辑方法在遵循目标提示方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本引导图像编辑中，虽然能忠实重建源图像，但反转的噪声图限制了编辑灵活性，难以紧密遵循目标文本提示。

Method: 分析噪声图特性以增强可编辑性，引入可编辑噪声精炼，通过最小化重建和编辑噪声图之间的差异来对齐期望编辑。

Result: 在广泛的图像编辑任务中，ENM Inversion在内容保持和编辑保真度方面优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion通过优化噪声图搜索，有效解决了文本引导编辑中内容保持与编辑灵活性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一个自监督框架，通过自我一致性原则让视觉语言模型自主改进图像质量评估能力，无需人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型后训练方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域如图像质量评估中尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用基于排名的自我一致性方法，通过成对多数投票生成伪标签，然后使用组相对策略优化进行迭代进化。

Result: 在多个IQA基准测试中，将基础模型的零样本性能提升了31.8%，在7个基准中的5个上超越了有监督的最先进模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明了完全自监督的方法可以在图像质量评估任务中达到甚至超越有监督方法的性能。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一个概率学生-教师模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置中优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG因其低成本和易获取性被广泛使用，研究表明ECG可以预测传统上需要更复杂ECHO模态才能获得的关键结果，使ECG成为预测心脏功能的更便捷方法。

Method: 集成概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)与ECHO-CLIP(在ECHO-文本对上预训练的视觉语言模型)，通过概率对比框架将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 在ECHO预测任务中，EchoingECG在零样本、少样本和微调设置下均优于最先进的ECG基础模型，方差估计有助于识别ECG中的不确定区域。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中，提高了ECG预测心脏功能的性能，并通过不确定性估计增强了模型可解释性。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 设计分层评估协议（S1：指称对象定位，S2：任务驱动指向，S3：视觉轨迹预测），在室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域收集数据。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的实验发现：GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位中表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在需要视觉轨迹规划的S3中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了VLMs在精确视觉定位方面的局限性，为评估具身推理能力提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

TL;DR: 提出DSGA模块和LoRA结合的参数高效微调方法，在极少量数据下改进SAM模型，用于农业图像中密集小物体的精确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业计算机视觉任务中训练数据有限、田间条件复杂的问题，提升基础模型在极端数据约束下的分割性能。

Method: 使用动态相似性图构建和自适应局部特征聚合的DSGA模块，结合LoRA创建互补优化框架，仅需4.00M可训练参数。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，相比基线SAM微调，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，在2/4/8/10-shot设置下性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂田间条件下实现了准确的豆荚计数（R²=0.8987），为自动化农业监测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型主要在通用基准上评估，而在智能产品审核等特定领域应用不足。传统logo识别方法需要记忆数万个品牌的表示，这在现实场景中不实用。

Method: Logo-VGR将logo识别重新定义为基于比较的任务，要求模型匹配产品图像与候选logo而非直接生成品牌标签。引入Logo Perception Grounding注入领域知识，Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning增强推理能力。

Result: 实验结果显示Logo-VGR在OOD设置下比强基线高出近10个点，展现出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过领域特定的多模态推理范式，在仅监督少量品牌的情况下实现了大规模品牌识别的泛化，为产品审核等应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述自动评估指标主要针对短描述设计，不适用于长描述评估，且基于LLM的评估方法存在推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出VELA评估指标，采用新颖的LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge框架，并构建LongCap-Arena基准，包含7,805张图像、对应长参考描述和32,246个人类标注。

Result: VELA在LongCap-Arena基准上超越了现有评估指标，并在描述性、相关性和流畅性三个维度上达到了超人类性能。

Conclusion: VELA是首个专门针对长图像描述设计的自动评估指标，解决了现有方法的局限性，为长描述评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于奖励引导的图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在保持源图像语义内容的同时优化目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于奖励引导的方法主要用于图像生成，但在图像编辑任务中如何保持源图像内容同时优化特定目标奖励仍未被充分探索。

Method: 将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程，实现无需训练的奖励引导图像编辑。

Result: 在多种编辑任务上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反演的无训练引导基线，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了无需训练的奖励引导图像编辑，避免了奖励作弊问题，在保持图像内容的同时有效优化目标奖励。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现多模态推理在增强逻辑推理能力的同时会损害视觉感知基础，提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法来解决视觉遗忘问题，并在多个基准测试中取得新的最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态推理在视觉任务中显示出潜力，但研究发现其存在双重性：一方面增强逻辑推理能力，另一方面却可能逐渐损害视觉感知基础，导致基本视觉问题识别失败。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，通过明确引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹，增强模型对视觉信息的依赖。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试中取得了新的最优结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，平衡了推理能力与视觉感知基础，为视觉语言模型的发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态符号逻辑推理基准MuSLR，评估了7个最先进的视觉语言模型，发现它们在多模态符号推理方面表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%。提出了LogiCAM框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，其严谨的确定性推理有助于防止严重后果。需要评估当前最先进视觉语言模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 构建了MuSLR基准，包含1,093个实例，涵盖7个领域，包括35个原子符号逻辑和976个逻辑组合，推理深度从2到9。提出了LogiCAM框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 7个最先进视觉语言模型在MuSLR上表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%。LogiCAM框架将GPT-4.1的思维链性能提升了14.13%，在复杂逻辑如一阶逻辑上提升更大。错误分析显示约70%的失败源于模态间的逻辑不对齐。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，LogiCAM框架能有效提升性能。模态间的逻辑不对齐是主要挑战，为未来改进提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

Motivation: 工业异常检测依赖基础模型，但现有研究主要关注文本提示调优，视觉处理部分分散且模型特定。本文旨在解决这一局限，统一视觉补丁处理。

Method: 提出PatchEAD框架，包含对齐模块和前景掩码等视觉提示技术，构建统一的补丁专注框架，无需训练即可进行异常检测。

Result: 实验显示在少样本和批量零样本场景下性能优于先前工作，无需文本特征。分析了骨干网络结构和预训练特性对补丁相似性鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: 统一的纯补丁框架可实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示，为实际视觉检测提供了基础模型选择和配置的实用指导。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 融合摄像头和LiDAR数据能增强空间理解，但现有方法在低光照条件下表现不佳，需要一种能在各种光照条件下可靠工作的融合方法。

Method: 使用多摄像头配置，通过初始校准确定相机内参，自动计算LiDAR与相机间的几何变换，无需专用标定目标。在融合前进行色彩校正确保一致性，并集成低光图像增强模块。

Result: 使用Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四摄像头配置测试，优化后的软件实现了实时性能，在极低光照条件下仍能可靠地进行色彩化，成功恢复原本无法检测的场景细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、硬件无关的LiDAR点云色彩化解决方案，特别在低光照条件下表现出色，简化了设置流程并实现了实时处理。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的结果证实了该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过整合多尺度视觉语义和在实体及切片级别进行预测，显著提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

Motivation: 推动"用图像思考"范式的发展，解决当前视觉语言模型在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面的不足。

Method: 构建包含31k条思维链推理轨迹的数据集，并设计直接在视觉嵌入空间进行图像文本交错推理的模型，避免调用外部工具和重复编码生成图像。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出强大性能，验证了数据集的有效性和模型设计的优越性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher为推进多模态推理提供了有价值的资源和方法，展示了无需外部工具的图像交互推理的可行性。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高层场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务上表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1框架，包含混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，作为即插即用模块与预训练VLM集成，通过两阶段训练策略实现细粒度感知。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，在物体定位、区域生成理解和视觉区域推理方面表现卓越。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1建立了感知感知VLMs的有效灵活范式，弥合了高层推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 本文研究了训练数据特征对深度神经网络对抗鲁棒性的影响，发现数据量和模型规模遵循对数缩放规律，但数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模对实现广谱对抗鲁棒性更为关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在架构和训练范式上有所进步，但仍容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在了解训练数据特征如何影响对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36种最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督、自监督和对比学习方法，在6种黑盒攻击类别下测试，包括随机扰动、几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格迁移。

Result: 鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律：数据量增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率3.2%，模型规模增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率13.4%。自监督模型在精选数据集上表现优于更大但质量较低的数据集。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模能提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法将模态和类别视为独立因素，导致解决方案碎片化、内存开销大，且基于重建的多类别方法使用共享解码路径难以处理大域变化，造成边界扭曲和误报率高。

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一框架解决了多模态多类别异常检测中的碎片化和效率问题，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CO3方法，通过校正采样策略改善文本到图像扩散模型中的多概念提示保真度，避免概念缺失或碰撞问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多概念提示（如"猫和狗"）在扩散模型中出现的概念缺失、模糊或碰撞问题，这些问题是模型在采样过程中过度强调训练中学习较强的单个概念导致的

Method: 引入校正采样策略，引导模型远离提示中任何单个概念行为过强的区域，转向所有概念能够平衡共存的"纯"联合模式；分析现有多概念引导方案的不稳定权重机制，并调整采样保持在有利区域

Result: 在多样化多概念提示上的实验表明，相比标准基线和先前组合方法，该方法在概念覆盖率、平衡性和鲁棒性方面有改进，概念丢失或扭曲的情况更少

Conclusion: 轻量级校正引导可以显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐行为

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了SS-ACL框架，无需专家标注即可生成基于视觉证据的医学报告，通过解剖一致性学习和对比学习实现视觉-文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单独训练的检测模块，需要大量专家标注，成本高且存在病理分布偏差问题。

Method: 构建分层解剖图，通过递归重建细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐，引入基于解剖一致性的区域级对比学习。

Result: 在词汇准确率上超过最先进方法10%，临床效果提升25%，在零样本视觉定位任务上超过领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL无需专家标注即可生成准确且基于视觉证据的医学报告，在多个下游视觉任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法只能单独计算福利指标，且在水下鲑鱼场景中易受遮挡、相似外观和运动等问题的困扰。

Method: 使用姿态估计网络提取鲑鱼及其身体部位的边界框，通过专门模块利用身体部位信息处理水下鲑鱼场景的特定挑战。

Result: 在两个新的鲑鱼跟踪挑战数据集上，该方法优于当前最先进的行人跟踪器BoostTrack，并成功用于尾拍波长分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业水产养殖网箱中的鲑鱼福利监测提供了一种灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available
at https://github.com/espenbh/BoostCompTrack.

Motivation: 现有的交互式分割方法主要局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法在处理稀疏真实世界扫描时表现不佳，且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线来创建大规模场景级数据集，提出PinPoint3D交互框架，通过少量用户点点击实现细粒度分割。

Result: 在首次点击设置下平均IoU达到55.8%，仅需少量额外点击即可超过71.3% IoU，相比现有方法IoU和精度提升高达16%。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更精细和精确机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RH-Partial2Global方法，通过结合jackknife conformal prediction和covering design-based sampling，改进了视觉上下文学习中的示例选择机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VICL方法基于相似性优先假设，但该假设缺乏充分理论依据；同时Partial2Global依赖随机采样构建全局排序，导致覆盖不完整和冗余采样问题。

Method: 使用jackknife conformal prediction构建可靠替代集，采用covering design-based sampling确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上的实验表明，RH-Partial2Global性能优异，优于Partial2Global方法。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global通过更可靠的示例选择机制，有效提升了视觉上下文学习的性能。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型由于传统注意力机制的二次计算复杂度，难以处理长时长和高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于扩散的视频模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值循环机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性

Result: 相比最先进的扩散视频编辑方法，实现3.7倍加速和60%内存降低，在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor在长视频编辑中相比自注意力架构具有显著速度优势，为高效视频处理提供了可行方案

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Motivation: 解决第一人称视角图像中物体识别标注数据稀缺的问题，利用廉价易得的叙述文本作为弱监督信号

Method: 提出WISH模型，通过从叙述中提取知识来学习合理的手-物体关联，实现无需测试时叙述的人手物体分割

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Ego4D数据集上超越所有基线方法，达到全监督方法50%以上的性能

Conclusion: 叙述监督是学习人手物体分割的有效弱监督方法，能够显著减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

TL;DR: 提出AgenticIQA框架，将视觉语言模型与传统IQA工具动态结合，通过分解IQA任务为四个子任务来提高评分准确性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应不同失真类型、用户特定查询和可解释性需求，且评分与解释通常分离处理。

Method: 采用模块化代理框架，包含规划器、执行器和总结器，将IQA分解为失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行四个子任务。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA框架通过动态整合VLMs和传统IQA工具，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提供了更准确和可解释的图像质量评估。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

TL;DR: PFDepth是首个针孔-鱼眼异构多视角深度估计框架，通过联合优化两种相机的互补特性，在统一架构中处理任意组合的针孔和鱼眼相机，并在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性（无失真vs失真、小FOVvs大FOV、远场vs近场）进行联合优化，填补异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计研究的空白。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上超越了当前主流深度网络，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，既提供了技术新颖性，又提供了有价值的经验见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Motivation: 传统二阶PDE模型在去噪早期阶段会产生块状伪影，需要开发更有效的模型来同时抑制噪声和保留细节。

Method: 使用四阶非线性PDE模型，扩散过程由拉普拉斯算子和强度值共同引导，波部分保持精细细节和纹理，并将模型扩展到彩色图像处理。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI等指标上均优于现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法，在灰度图像和彩色图像上都取得了更好的去噪效果。

Conclusion: 提出的四阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面比传统二阶模型更有效，能更好地平衡噪声去除和细节保留。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种语义增强的两阶段检索方法，通过交集驱动策略和基于多模态LLM的细粒度重排序，解决了零样本组合图像检索中的特征融合不精确和语义关系解析不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的方法面临两个核心挑战：基于并集的特征融合会携带不相关的背景细节，而CLIP的全局余弦相似度缺乏解析细粒度语义关系的能力。

Method: SETR采用两阶段检索：粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；重排序阶段使用经过LoRA适配的多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上取得了新的最先进性能，在CIRR上的Recall@1提升了15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理为稳健且可移植的零样本组合图像检索建立了一个通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Motivation: 解决遥感数据与OSM数据之间的模态差异（数据结构、内容和空间粒度不同），使遥感基础模型能够有效利用丰富的地理上下文信息。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用OSM数据提供的多粒度学习信号，通过跨模态空间相关性进行信息交互；引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入。在下游任务中生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Result: 实验表明，预训练阶段整合OSM数据提升了遥感图像编码器性能，下游任务中融合RS和OSM数据提高了模型对复杂地理场景的适应性。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间相关性在多模态地理数据整合中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Motivation: 现有全尺寸视频超分辨率方法存在计算密集和输出分辨率固定的问题，需要探索更高效的基于预训练视频生成模型的方法。

Method: 提出PatchVSR方法，采用分块处理策略，包含双流适配器：局部分支提取输入块特征保持内容保真度，全局分支从缩放的完整视频中提取上下文特征。注入位置信息以更好地在全局视频帧中定位块合成，并提出多块联合调制确保视觉一致性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能在块级别合成高保真、高分辨率细节，基于512x512基础模型实现了极具竞争力的4K视频超分辨率，且效率极高。

Conclusion: 分块式视频超分辨率方法有效克服了全尺寸方法的计算密集和分辨率固定问题，为高效高质量的视频超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中OOD泛化挑战，特别是在生物医学图像领域，现有方法追求域不变性但可能忽略因果机制

Method: 使用因果引导的高斯扰动，在背景区域施加更强扰动、前景区域施加较弱扰动，鼓励模型依赖因果相关特征

Result: 在WILDS基准Camelyon17上表现优于现有OOD基线方法

Conclusion: 因果扰动作为可靠且可解释泛化工具的潜力

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决CLIP在小样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在小样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，由持续模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标导致，使图像间直接比较不可靠。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容完整。该方法为闭式解，可选择通过多模态监督训练。

Result: 训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体性能优于其他方法，尤其在低数据场景（1、2、4样本）表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP的小样本分类问题，提供了一种轻量级但强大的解决方案。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性（如前景-背景不匹配），通过轻量级分割引导评分（SGS）管道增强多模态操纵检测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在DGM4数据集上表现优异，但在主要主体被上下文错误地放置到不合理背景时持续失败，存在标签空间偏差、局部注意力焦点和伪文本-前景对齐问题

Method: 提出SGS管道：使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，用联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合

Result: SGS显著增强了对全局操纵的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和令牌级解释，且仅需推理阶段计算，计算开销可忽略

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

### [81] [DGM4+: Dataset Extension for Global Scene Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26047)
*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文扩展了DGM4数据集，新增5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，以测试检测器在局部和全局推理上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和标题更改），而现实世界伪造中普遍存在全局不一致性（如前景与背景不匹配），这留下了一个关键的研究空白。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1和精心设计的提示生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景中。标题在三种条件下生成：字面意义、文本属性和文本分割，产生三种新的操作类别。

Result: 创建了包含FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种操作类别的5000个高质量样本，通过质量控制管道确保数据质量，包括人脸可见性、感知哈希去重、基于OCR的文本清理和真实标题长度。

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集通过引入全局操作补充了现有数据集，创建了一个测试检测器在局部和全局推理上的基准，旨在加强多模态模型（如HAMMER）的评估，这些模型目前在处理FG-BG不一致性方面存在困难。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于主纤维丛截面概念的新方法，用于在分类任务中消除对称性，避免传统的数据增强方法，从而构建更可持续的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学应用中的数据集通常包含对称性（如旋转、缩放等），传统方法使用数据增强来学习这些对称性，但这种方法不够可持续。

Method: 使用主纤维丛截面的几何框架，通过测量对称群作用下对象轨道之间的差异来消除对称性，并优化截面以最大化类别分离。

Result: 在包含平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化对称性的对象轮廓数据集上验证了该方法，提出了包含恒定速度参数化在内的2参数曲线规范参数化族。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单有效的几何框架来处理对称性问题，具有广泛的应用潜力，相关代码和教程已开源。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用基础模型生成3D伪标签的方法，解决自监督语义占据预测中计算成本高的问题，显著提升性能并实现SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督方法如新视角合成等计算成本高、内存消耗大，且难以迁移到其他架构。需要更高效的伪标签生成方法。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪标签，利用时序信息进行标签稠密化，提出简化模型EasyOcc仅从伪标签学习。

Result: 在OccNeRF模型上mIoU提升45%（9.73→14.09），EasyOcc达到13.86 mIoU，在不使用相机掩码的全场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间选择对自监督学习的全面场景理解至关重要。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一个实时多模态深度学习框架，在足球接触前预测点球方向（左、中、右），准确率达89%，推理时间22毫秒


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球经常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内从细微的生物力学线索中预判踢球者意图

Method: 使用双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN提取RGB帧空间特征，LSTM网络处理2D关键点并带有注意力机制，姿态关键点引导视觉关注任务相关区域

Result: 在755个点球事件的数据集上达到89%准确率，比仅视觉和仅姿态的基线模型提升14-22%

Conclusion: 轻量级且可解释的设计适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

TL;DR: Reason-3D是一个基于大型推理模型的文本到场景生成方法，通过对象检索和空间推理来解决复杂几何和物体变换的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何和物体变换时表现不佳，且对复杂指令的遵循能力较弱。

Method: 集成基于物理、功能和上下文属性的对象检索，基于隐式和显式布局约束放置对象，并通过碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Result: 在从简单到复杂的室内配置指令评估中，Reason-3D在视觉保真度、约束遵循和资源检索质量方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域的发展，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理差异问题。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础

Method: 从信息论视角分析扩散模型推理过程，提出基于条件熵优化的EVODiff方法，优化条件方差来最小化转换和重建误差

Result: 在CIFAR-10上10步推理重建误差降低45.5%，ImageNet-256上减少25%推理步数，文本到图像生成质量提升且减少伪影

Conclusion: 信息论视角为扩散模型推理提供了理论基础，EVODiff方法在质量和效率上均优于现有SOTA方法

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

TL;DR: EchoGen是首个基于视觉自回归模型(VAR)的前馈式主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略分离主题的高层语义身份和低层细节，在保持高质量的同时显著降低采样延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前主题驱动生成方法的两难困境：要么依赖计算昂贵的逐主题微调，牺牲效率和零样本能力；要么使用基于扩散模型的前馈架构，但存在推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 采用双路径注入策略：语义编码器提取主题抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入；内容编码器捕获视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成。

Result: EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量上达到与最先进扩散方法相当的水平，同时显著降低了采样延迟。

Conclusion: EchoGen成功将VAR模型的快速采样优势与主题驱动生成能力结合，为创意AI提供了高效高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EntroPE（熵引导动态补丁编码器），通过条件熵动态检测时间序列中的过渡点来放置补丁边界，解决了传统补丁方法破坏时间连贯性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的时间序列预测方法使用时间无关的补丁构建策略，任意起始位置和固定长度会破坏时间连贯性，分割自然过渡并削弱表示学习。

Method: EntroPE包含两个关键模块：基于熵的动态补丁器（EDP）使用信息论标准定位自然时间变化点确定补丁边界；自适应补丁编码器（APE）使用池化和交叉注意力捕获补丁内依赖关系并生成固定大小的潜在表示。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态补丁方法为时间序列建模提供了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable

Conclusion: Human-MME基准为MLLM研究提供了更全面的评估框架，指导未来研究朝着更好的人类中心图像理解方向发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

Result: 发现检测器对腿部平行、肘部伸直和侧向视角的行人存在偏见；下半身关节遮挡比上半身和头部遮挡对检测率的负面影响更大；Cascade R-CNN具有最低的总体漏检率和最小的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是首个在自动驾驶行人检测中进行的全面姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，揭示了现有模型在公平性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于细胞显微镜图像自动多属性标注的新框架，通过双模型架构实现细胞类型分类和多属性分类，准确率达94.62%，显著提升模型可解释性和标注效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细胞显微镜领域，多属性分类相比传统的细胞类型分类研究不足，需要自动化、细粒度的多属性标注方法来提高效率和可解释性。

Method: 使用两个互补数据集，提出双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类，实现自动化的多属性标注。

Result: 在多属性分类任务中达到94.62%的准确率，显著优于传统人工标注方法，在时间和成本效率上有明显提升。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了一个可扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务的新范式，通过有效自动化多属性标签扩展来提升标注效率。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and

showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法使用密集像素级表示，存在冗余且难以扩展，需要更高效的表示方法

Method: 使用少量2D高斯基元编码关键判别信息，采用CUDA-based splatting算子实现并行推理和训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到最先进性能，编码解码成本高效

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用且高度可扩展的数据集蒸馏方法

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

TL;DR: 提出了MGCE框架解决广义类别发现问题，通过多粒度概念专家自适应挖掘视觉概念，无需预先知道未标注数据的类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息，限制了表示质量；大多数方法假设训练时已知未标注类别的数量，这在现实场景中不实用。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习(DCCL)交替进行概念挖掘和双级表示学习；多粒度专家协作学习(MECL)引入不同粒度的额外专家，并使用概念对齐矩阵实现跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上的广泛实验表明，MGCE实现了最先进的结果，特别是在新类别准确率方面。即使没有类别数量的先验知识，MGCE也优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE能够自动估计未标注数据中的类别数量，适用于实际的开放世界设置，为广义类别发现提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

TL;DR: IMG是一种无需额外数据或编辑操作的多模态对齐框架，通过MLLM识别错位、隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征、以及可训练的迭代更新偏好目标来实现图像与提示的精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成图像与输入提示之间的多模态对齐问题，现有方法要么依赖有限的高质量偏好数据微调，要么通过编辑局部区域可能损害整体图像质量。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型识别错位，引入隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征以减少错位并实现重新生成，将重新对齐目标制定为可训练的迭代更新偏好目标。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的广泛定性和定量评估显示，IMG优于现有对齐方法，并可作为灵活的即插即用适配器增强先前的微调对齐方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一种无需额外数据或编辑操作的有效多模态对齐解决方案，能够显著提升扩散模型生成图像与提示的对齐精度。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型如Donut虽然有效，但对于实时或资源受限应用来说成本过高，需要模型压缩方法。

Method: 利用机制可解释性驱动学生架构设计，分析内部计算以识别需要保留的关键子组件，同时明确哪些子组件应该被近似、跳过或重新参数化。

Result: 开发出Donut-MINT，一个剪枝后的Donut变体，在DocVQA基准测试上保持强劲性能的同时减少了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将压缩重新定义为电路发现，连接了可解释性研究和实用的视觉语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Motivation: 现有潜在动作模型存在两个瓶颈：端到端训练的图像编码器空间理解能力差，以及输入帧距离较远时模型脆弱导致时间感知有限，这阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模，从连续帧中捕获结构先验和动态运动模式。进一步构建SSM-VLA端到端框架，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块来显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界设置的多个VLA任务中验证SSM-VLA，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 深度伪造检测面临高质量数据集稀缺的问题，现有多模态大语言模型在检测性能上表现不佳，其推理往往与视觉证据不一致或产生幻觉。

Method: 构建推理标注数据集，并提出段落级相对策略优化（PRPO）强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容。

Result: PRPO大幅提升检测准确率，获得4.55/5.0的最高推理分数，在测试条件下显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 将多模态推理基于视觉证据对于实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

Method: 提出基于聚类的仿射变换(CAT)，使用聚类特定的参数来对齐低比特输出与全精度输出，仅需少量额外参数

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，CAT框架在多种架构和低比特设置下优于现有PTQ方法，W2A2 ResNet-18达到53.18% Top-1准确率，作为插件可提升基线方法3%以上

Conclusion: CAT是一种有效的低比特后训练量化误差减少框架，无需模型或量化参数微调即可显著提升性能

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点监督方法存在伪标签利用效率低和质量差的问题，需要一种更有效的弱监督定向目标检测方法。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在不同训练阶段动态估计实例大小，实现标签分配方法的使用；2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：结合SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，克服各自在稀疏和密集场景中的性能缺陷。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得优异性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别在物体尺寸变化大或稀疏场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，在稀疏和密集场景下都实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

Motivation: 传统方法将视频分解为空间和时间分量，依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。需要一种更统一、连续的表征方法。

Method: 将视频编码为连续、时空相干的3D视频傅里叶场，使用神经编码器预测傅里叶基系数，包含高斯点扩散函数实现抗锯齿重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在广泛的放大因子范围内提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 联合建模方法显著改善了时空超分辨率性能，证明了连续傅里叶场表征在视频超分辨率任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，通过大规模人工标注数据集训练，用于解决开源图像编辑模型缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题，能够有效筛选高质量训练数据并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源图像编辑模型落后于闭源模型，主要瓶颈是缺乏可靠的奖励模型来扩展高质量合成训练数据。

Method: 构建大规模人工偏好数据集（包含20万对偏好标注），训练\mname奖励模型，用于评估图像编辑质量并筛选训练数据。

Result: \mname在多个基准测试中达到最佳人类相关性，使用其筛选的数据训练Step1X-Edit模型相比全数据集训练有显著提升。

Conclusion: \mname作为奖励模型能够有效扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，具有强化学习后训练和测试时扩展等潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG)新问题，旨在基于任务描述定位长视频中的关键时间区间，并建立了ToTG Bench基准和TimeScope框架来解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别长视频中的关键时刻对于下游理解和推理任务至关重要，但传统方法在泛化性和处理长视频方面存在局限。

Method: 提出了TimeScope框架，采用渐进推理方法：首先在长视频中识别粗粒度的时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼该范围，并使用ToTG Pile数据集增强性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下均优于现有的时间定位方法和流行的MLLMs。

Conclusion: TimeScope能有效解决这一新的具有挑战性的问题，在任务导向的时间定位方面表现出色。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专门为基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过token熵和两级缩放机制提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法依赖于频繁的部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。

Method: 提出ScalingAR框架，利用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号，在配置文件级别融合内在和条件信号来校准置信状态，在策略级别自适应终止低置信轨迹并动态调度引导强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型在GenEval上提升12.5%，在TIIF-Bench上提升15.2%；视觉token消耗减少62.0%的同时超越基线；在挑战性场景中缓解性能下降26.0%。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功地将测试时缩放应用于自回归图像生成，显著提升了生成质量、效率和鲁棒性，为视觉自回归模型提供了有效的缩放解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了PANDA，一种基于多模态大语言模型的智能AI工程师，用于实现无需训练数据或人工干预的通用视频异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法依赖特定领域训练数据和人工调整，在新场景和未见异常类型上泛化能力有限且成本高昂，因此需要实现通用的异常检测系统。

Method: 开发了PANDA系统，具备四种关键能力：自适应场景感知策略规划、目标驱动启发式推理、工具增强的自我反思和自我改进的记忆链机制。具体包括场景感知RAG机制、潜在异常引导的启发式提示策略、渐进式反思机制和记忆链机制。

Result: 大量实验表明，PANDA在多场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中实现了最先进的性能，无需训练和人工干预，验证了其通用和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA成功实现了通用视频异常检测，能够自动处理任何场景和异常类型，为视频异常检测领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

TL;DR: MotionRAG是一个检索增强框架，通过从相关参考视频中提取运动先验来提升图像到视频生成的动态真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在运动真实性方面仍面临挑战，难以准确建模物理约束、物体交互和特定领域动态。

Method: 提出检索式流水线提取高层运动特征，使用上下文学习进行运动适应，并通过注意力机制将运动特征无缝集成到预训练视频扩散模型中。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个领域和基础模型上都取得了显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略，且模块化设计支持零样本泛化到新领域。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和迁移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像难度感知的超分辨率模型评估方法，使用高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数来识别测试图像中模型性能差异，弥补传统平均分数评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率模型评估使用平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，也无法捕捉某些模型在困难图像上产生的伪影问题。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量指标：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测测试图像中模型间的视觉差异，并设计相应的评估方法将这些视觉差异反映在客观指标上。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分在平均分数相近但视觉结果不同的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 提出的难度感知评估方法能够更准确地评估超分辨率模型的性能，特别是在识别模型在困难图像上的表现差异方面具有优势。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

TL;DR: 提出了PRISM框架，这是一个渐进式的三阶段图像去雨方法，通过混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba模块，在多尺度上同时处理空间语义和小波域特征，实现精细的去雨效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单尺度图像去雨模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在不足，需要一种能够同时学习高频雨纹特征并保持结构细节的方法。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进框架：CENet进行粗提取，SFNet使用混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba进行多尺度特征融合，RNet通过原始分辨率子网络恢复细粒度结构。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了与近期去雨方法相竞争的结果，能够有效去除雨纹同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式处理和混合域建模，成功解决了图像去雨中的细粒度恢复和全局一致性问题。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位量化，在保持纹理细节的同时显著降低计算需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高难以部署。现有的8位量化能匹配全精度性能，但扩展到4位量化仍面临挑战，因为更大的步长会放大舍入误差，导致细粒度纹理丢失

Method: QuaRTZ方法结合8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位，从而保持纹理细节。该方法平衡了异常值保留和LSB精度

Result: 4位QuaRTZ在FLUX.1-schnell上达到6.98的FID分数，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过理论推导和实证评估证明了对不同激活分布的通用性，为扩散模型的高效部署提供了有效的4位量化解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Motivation: 现代生产线确保每辆车符合正确的变体规格且无可见缺陷是一个日益复杂的挑战。

Method: 使用11个同步相机捕获车辆360度视图，将任务特定视图路由到专用模块：YOLOv8用于零件检测、EfficientNet用于ICE/EV分类、Gemini-1.5 Flash用于吉祥物OCR、YOLOv8-Seg用于划痕和凹陷分割。通过视图感知融合层标准化证据，VIN条件规则引擎将检测特征与预期清单进行比较。

Result: 在混合数据集上，AVI达到93%的验证准确率、86%的缺陷检测召回率，并维持3.3辆车/分钟的处理速度，大幅超越单视图或无分割基线。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)

achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单次前向传播的3D高斯框架，用于3D风格迁移，支持从单张图像到多视角集合的无姿态内容，通过参考风格图像实现几何感知、视角一致的风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D风格迁移方法需要逐场景优化或预计算姿态的问题，实现无需优化、无需姿态的零样本3D风格迁移。

Method: 采用Transformer主干网络，包含几何预测路径（自注意力保持几何保真度）和风格注入路径（全局交叉注意力确保视角一致性），并引入基于体素的3D风格损失来对齐场景特征与风格统计。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，具有良好的泛化能力，支持从单视角到大规模多视角设置。

Conclusion: Stylos通过全局风格-内容耦合、3D风格损失和可扩展框架，实现了有效的3D风格迁移，无需逐场景优化或预计算姿态。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

Result: 在Places8数据集上超越基于图像的方法，达到81.27%平衡准确率；在真实世界CSAI评估中达到74.27%平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和CSAI分类的强大范式，具有可解释性和隐私保护优势。

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级CBAM-CNN模型能有效识别betel叶病害，具有高精度和平衡的分类性能，为betel叶产业提供了实用的病害检测解决方案。

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Motivation: 大型语言模型计算成本高，不适合资源受限的边缘环境，而仅预训练的小型模型性能不足，需要高效提升其准确率。

Method: 采用课程式监督微调和离线策略知识蒸馏的后训练流程。

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下保持强泛化能力和多种任务的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: 为昇腾边缘设备开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设理想dToF输入和完美对齐，忽略了校准误差和异常，限制了实际应用性

Method: 基于合成数据集的模拟训练方法、无学习参数异常检测机制、针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升dToF传感器在真实场景中的深度感知能力，具有很好的泛化性和实用性

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试无法捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和需求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含76个控制节点的四个层次化分类体系，开发了自动化的提示分类和问题生成流程，进行了大规模人类研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注）。

Result: 即使最强的现有模型在Events和Camera相关控制方面仍存在显著差距，训练了优于现有零样本基线的自动评估器。

Conclusion: SCINE是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型背景下的方法，通过以电影控制为中心的分类体系和结构化评估流程指导未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Motivation: 电子显微镜连接组学中的人工校对成本是当前瓶颈，阻碍了大规模连接组重建和比较连接组学的发展

Method: 利用已有的人工标注数据训练机器学习模型，自动化或优化校对工作流程，包括引导校对和自动合并分割片段

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效自动化连接组学校对流程，大幅降低人工成本并提高重建效率

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够根据任意新焦点和模糊级别对已创建图像进行灵活重新对焦，解决了传统景深效果固定且难以修改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影中的景深效果一旦创建就难以修改，当主体失焦时会造成问题。需要一种能够灵活调整图像对焦点和模糊程度的方法。

Method: 设计了基于扩散变换器的重新对焦学习框架，使用模拟数据生成大规模图像对，并提出了基于摄影原理的堆叠约束来增强训练，确保精确的景深操作。

Result: 实验表明DiffCamera能够在各种场景中实现稳定的重新对焦，为摄影和生成AI应用提供了前所未有的景深调整控制能力。

Conclusion: DiffCamera通过创新的训练约束和模拟数据生成，成功实现了灵活的图像重新对焦功能，在摄影和生成AI领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制，无法在专业Foley工作流中优先处理特定对象，经常生成不必要的背景声音或关注错误对象。

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成任务，提出SAGANet多模态生成模型，利用视觉分割掩码、视频和文本线索进行可控音频生成。

Result: 相比当前最先进方法有显著改进，为可控、高保真Foley合成设立了新标准。

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割实现了细粒度和视觉定位的音频控制，推动了分割感知Foley研究的进展。

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Conclusion: 降维不仅是预处理步骤，更是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键组成部分。

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全景深度估计中存在的两个主要挑战：全景数据稀缺导致零样本泛化能力差，以及球形失真问题导致传统方法效率低下。

Method: 1) 开发数据增强引擎，从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据，创建了约607K全景RGB-深度对；2) 提出SphereViT架构，利用球形坐标强制全景图像特征的球形几何一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的综合基准测试显示，DA²实现了最先进的性能，在AbsRel指标上比最强的零样本基线平均提升38%。令人惊讶的是，它甚至超越了先前的域内方法。

Conclusion: DA²作为一个端到端解决方案，在零样本泛化能力和效率方面都显著优于基于融合的方法，展示了其在全景深度估计领域的优越性。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

TL;DR: HART是一个用于稀疏视角人体重建的统一框架，能够从少量未标定RGB图像中重建水密着装网格、对齐的SMPL-X身体网格和高斯溅射表示，实现照片级真实感的新视角渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板而忽略宽松衣物和人-物交互，要么在简化相机假设下训练隐式函数，限制了在真实场景中的应用。HART旨在解决这些问题，实现更鲁棒的人体重建。

Method: 预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，采用遮挡感知的泊松重建来恢复完整几何形状，即使是在自遮挡区域。这些预测与参数化SMPL-X身体模型对齐，确保重建几何与人体结构一致。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得最先进结果：着装网格重建的Chamfer距离改善18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS减少15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈变换器可以作为在真实世界设置中进行鲁棒人体重建的可扩展模型。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了第一个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计使模型对姿态和尺度保持不变，解决了现有方法依赖预对齐导致的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法假设扫描数据已预对齐到规范坐标系，这导致网络可能利用姿态和尺度线索记忆绝对位置而非推断内在几何。当真实数据缺乏对齐时性能会崩溃。

Method: 引入SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，其模块化层依次规范化特征、在相似不变几何上推理，并恢复原始坐标系。采用去偏评估协议移除隐藏线索。

Result: 在PCN基准测试中优于等变和数据增强基线；在KITTI和OmniObject3D上创下跨域记录，分别降低最小匹配距离17%和Chamfer距离14%。

Conclusion: 完全SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径，即使在更严格的协议下仍优于竞争对手的偏置设置。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Motivation: 现有SLAM基准无法充分反映头戴式设备面临的挑战，如多样的运动模式、动态视觉内容、长时间运行导致的传感器标定变化等，且缺乏足够准确的地面真值。

Method: 使用眼镜式设备记录城市中心的多小时、多公里轨迹，配备多种传感器；利用测量工具获取厘米级精度的控制点作为间接姿态标注。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

Motivation: 当前统一框架中，多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成内在纠缠，需要解耦这两个关键能力。

Method: 使用多模态kontext（语义线索和粗粒度图像条件）连接VLM和扩散模型，采用三阶段渐进训练策略：连接VLM与轻量扩散头、扩展到预训练扩散模型、引入低级图像编码器进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强统一基线相当，在某些情况下甚至优于任务特定的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功解耦了多模态生成推理和视觉合成，为统一多模态模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Stitch的训练免费方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制整合到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了文本到图像生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型在空间关系（如"上方"或"右侧"）的准确捕捉方面存在持续挑战，早期方法随着架构演进变得与现代模型不兼容。

Method: Stitch方法通过自动生成边界框，在指定边界框内生成单个对象并无缝拼接，利用目标注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上的表现提高了218%，在PosEval上提高了206%，并在Qwen-Image上实现了54%的改进。

Conclusion: Stitch实现了最先进的结果，成功将位置控制整合到领先模型中，同时保持训练免费的方法。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

TL;DR: TTT3R是一种无需训练的干预方法，通过测试时训练视角改进3D重建基础模型，利用记忆状态与观测之间的对齐置信度来平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应，显著提升了长度泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中表现出色，但其性能在超出训练上下文长度时会显著下降，显示出有限的长度泛化能力。

Method: 从测试时训练的角度重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计视为在线学习问题。利用记忆状态与输入观测之间的对齐置信度推导出记忆更新的闭式学习率。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化，在全局姿态估计上比基线提高了2倍，同时以20 FPS的速度运行，仅使用6 GB GPU内存处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: 通过测试时训练视角和基于对齐置信度的自适应学习率，可以显著提升3D重建模型的长度泛化能力，而无需额外训练。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向新闻工作者的LLM文档搜索方法，使用小型本地部署模型，通过五阶段流程确保透明度、编辑控制和数据隐私，在标准桌面硬件上可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新闻编辑室采用LLM进行文档检索时面临的幻觉风险、验证负担和数据隐私问题，提供透明可控的AI辅助工具。

Method: 采用五阶段流水线：语料库摘要、搜索规划、并行线程执行、质量评估和综合，使用小型量化模型（Gemma 3 12B、Qwen 3 14B、GPT-OSS 20B）在本地部署。

Result: 所有模型都实现了高引用有效性，能在标准桌面硬件（24GB内存）上有效运行。但存在错误传播和性能因训练数据与语料内容重叠度而显著变化的问题。

Conclusion: 有效的新闻编辑室AI部署需要谨慎的模型选择和系统设计，以及人工监督来保持准确性和问责标准。

Abstract: Investigative journalists routinely confront large document collections.
Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
capabilities promise to accelerate the process of document discovery, but
newsroom adoption remains limited due to hallucination risks, verification
burden, and data privacy concerns. We present a journalist-centered approach to
LLM-powered document search that prioritizes transparency and editorial control
through a five-stage pipeline -- corpus summarization, search planning,
parallel thread execution, quality evaluation, and synthesis -- using small,
locally-deployable language models that preserve data security and maintain
complete auditability through explicit citation chains. Evaluating three
quantized models (Gemma 3 12B, Qwen 3 14B, and GPT-OSS 20B) on two corpora, we
find substantial variation in reliability. All models achieved high citation
validity and ran effectively on standard desktop hardware (e.g., 24 GB of
memory), demonstrating feasibility for resource-constrained newsrooms. However,
systematic challenges emerged, including error propagation through multi-stage
synthesis and dramatic performance variation based on training data overlap
with corpus content. These findings suggest that effective newsroom AI
deployment requires careful model selection and system design, alongside human
oversight for maintaining standards of accuracy and accountability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的相关性判断方法过度依赖敏感提示策略，缺乏标准化工作流程来生成可靠标签，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 采用任务感知的基于评分标准的评估(TRUE)方法，通过迭代数据采样和推理，从意图、覆盖度、特异性、准确性和有用性等多个维度评估相关性判断。

Result: 在TREC DL 2019、2020和LLMJudge数据集上的评估显示，TRUE在系统排名的LLM排行榜上取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: TRUE提供了一个可复现的LLM相关性判断框架，并在多个维度上证明了其有效性。

Abstract: LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in
advancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has
progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments
as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \cite{rahmani2025judging}. However,
existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting
strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To
fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \textit{Task-aware Rubric-based
Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for
usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in
relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible
workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to
evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent,
coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE
on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE
achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary
focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based
relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across
multiple dimensions.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HiFIRec是一种多行为推荐方法，通过分层抑制高频低意图行为的噪声信号，并使用强度感知非采样策略修正误导性频繁模式，显著提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多行为推荐方法通常统一建模用户意图，未能充分考虑不同行为间的异质性。高频但低意图的行为可能包含噪声信号和误导性频繁模式，阻碍用户意图学习。

Method: 提出分层抑制噪声信号：通过层间邻域聚合提取邻域信息，自适应跨层特征融合捕获用户意图；使用强度感知非采样策略动态调整负样本权重来修正频繁模式。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，HiFIRec相比多个最先进方法，HR@10指标相对提升了4.21%-6.81%。

Conclusion: HiFIRec通过差异化的行为建模有效修正了高频低意图行为的影响，在多行为推荐任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item
interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, providing
personalized services in domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. Most
existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a
unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different
behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may
implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible
while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this
end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec,
that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by
differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically
suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through
layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions
through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent
patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically
adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two
benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over
several state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种Transformer模型在金融交易理解任务中的表现，发现针对特定领域定制的小型专有模型在速度和成本效率上优于通用大语言模型，最终选择实现专有的仅解码器模型，提高了14%的交易覆盖率并节省了1300多万美元年成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融交易分析对监管合规、欺诈检测和决策支持至关重要。鉴于Transformer模型在多个领域表现出色，本文旨在探索其在理解金融交易方面的潜力。

Method: 对三种Transformer模型类型进行广泛实验：仅编码器、仅解码器和编码器-解码器模型。每种类型探索三种选项：预训练LLM、微调LLM和从头开发的小型专有模型。

Result: LLMs（如LLaMA3-8b、Flan-T5和SBERT）在金融交易理解任务中并未显著优于小型专有模型，特别是在速度和成本效率方面。专有模型处理时间更快、运营成本更低。

Conclusion: 模型选择应基于特定领域需求，在专业应用中定制专有模型比通用LLMs具有潜在优势。最终实现的专有仅解码器模型提高了14%交易覆盖率，节省超过1300万美元年成本。

Abstract: Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory
compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of
financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract
meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based
models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper
seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This
paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer
models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type,
we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small
proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while
LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive
capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not
significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of
financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in
terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique
requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower
operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the
financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection
based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of
customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized
applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only
model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage.
This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than
\$13 million annual cost.

*Han Zhang,Dongfang Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于正则化自编码器(RAE)的k-NN保持降维方法，通过神经网络优化能力和瑞利商界的约束效应，在降维过程中保持向量间的k近邻关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维嵌入向量在检索增强生成和推荐系统等任务中广泛应用，但传统降维方法如PCA和UMAP由于无法保持向量间的最近邻关系，很少被用于加速检索过程。

Method: 使用正则化自编码器，通过正则化项约束网络参数变化，调整奇异值来控制嵌入向量在降维过程中的幅度变化，从而保持k-NN关系。提供了严格的数学分析证明正则化建立了变换向量范数失真率的上界。

Result: RAE在适度训练开销下，相比现有降维方法实现了更优的k-NN召回率，同时保持了快速的检索效率。

Conclusion: RAE方法为k-NN保持降维提供了可证明的保证，在保持检索效率的同时显著提升了最近邻关系的保持能力。

Abstract: While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in
various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems,
popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely
been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of
preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by
neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh
quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving
dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation
through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding
magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization
establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors,
thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest
training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR
approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的推荐器主要依赖连续高斯噪声，这与推荐中用户偏好数据的离散性质不匹配。需要开发更适合离散数据的扩散方法。

Method: PreferGrow通过三个核心方面实现：离散建模偏好比例、通过偏好淡化进行扰动、通过偏好增长进行重建。采用矩阵化公式，具有马尔可夫性和可逆性理论保证。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，PreferGrow相比最先进的扩散推荐器取得了持续的性能提升，证明了其理论合理性和实证有效性。

Conclusion: PreferGrow提供了一种理论完善且实证有效的离散扩散推荐方法，更好地匹配了推荐任务的离散和排序导向特性。

Abstract: Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user
interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent
advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which
alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the
collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current
diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,
which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference
data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in
discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based
recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user
preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing
diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of
preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item
pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.
This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature
of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of
injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the
preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --
thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference
reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by
iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.
PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical
guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across
five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and
empirical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了IPGC框架，作为可插拔的通用批判推荐系统方案，通过物品代理机制将用户-关键词优化目标转化为用户-物品对，并引入抗遗忘正则化器解决持续批判中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有批判推荐系统需要专门构建用户-关键词关联模型，适用场景受限，且忽视了多步连续批判中的灾难性遗忘问题，导致模型性能崩溃。

Method: IPGC框架包含物品代理机制和抗遗忘正则化器，前者将用户-关键词批判转化为用户-物品优化目标，后者通过正则化约束防止模型参数在连续批判中过度偏移。

Result: IPGC可作为通用插件集成到大多数基于协同过滤的知识图谱推荐模型中，实现无缝的批判机制集成和迭代推荐优化。

Conclusion: IPGC为批判推荐系统提供了新的通用范式，解决了专门模型构建和灾难性遗忘两大核心问题，推动了批判推荐在主流推荐场景中的应用。

Abstract: Modern recommender systems place great inclination towards facilitating user
experience, as more applications enabling users to critique and then refine
recommendations immediately. Considering the real-time requirements,
critique-able recommender systems typically straight modify the model
parameters and update the recommend list through analyzing the user critiquing
keyphrases in the inference phase. Current critiquing methods require first
constructing a specially designated model which establish direct correlations
between users and keyphrases during the training phase allowing for innovative
recommendations upon the critiquing,restricting the applicable scenarios.
Additionally, all these approaches ignore the catastrophic forgetting problem,
where the cumulative changes in parameters during continuous multi-step
critiquing may lead to a collapse in model performance. Thus, We conceptualize
a proxy bridging users and keyphrases, proposing a streamlined yet potent Items
Proxy Generic Critiquing Framework (IPGC) framework, which can serve as a
universal plugin for most knowledge graph recommender models based on
collaborative filtering (CF) strategies. IPGC provides a new paradigm for
frictionless integration of critique mechanisms to enable iterative
recommendation refinement in mainstream recommendation scenarios. IPGC
describes the items proxy mechanism for transforming the critiquing
optimization objective of user-keyphrase pairs into user-item pairs, adapting
it for general CF recommender models without the necessity of specifically
designed user-keyphrase correlation module. Furthermore, an anti-forgetting
regularizer is introduced in order to efficiently mitigate the catastrophic
forgetting problem of the model as a prior for critiquing optimization.

Conclusion: DSPnet是学习场景与物品序列联合关系的有效方法，显著提升了用户行为预测性能

Abstract: Modeling sequential user behaviors for future behavior prediction is crucial
in improving user's information retrieval experience. Recent studies highlight
the importance of incorporating contextual information to enhance prediction
performance. One crucial but usually neglected contextual information is the
scene feature which we define as sub-interfaces within an app, created by
developers to provide specific functionalities, such as ``text2product search"
and ``live" modules in e-commence apps. Different scenes exhibit distinct
functionalities and usage habits, leading to significant distribution gap in
user engagement across them. Popular sequential behavior models either ignore
the scene feature or merely use it as attribute embeddings, which cannot
effectively capture the dynamic interests and interplay between scenes and
items when modeling user sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Dual
Sequence Prediction networks (DSPnet) to effectively capture the dynamic
interests and interplay between scenes and items for future behavior
prediction. DSPnet consists of two parallel networks dedicated to learn users'
dynamic interests over items and scenes, and a sequence feature enhancement
module to capture the interplay for enhanced future behavior prediction.
Further, we introduce a Conditional Contrastive Regularization (CCR) loss to
capture the invariance of similar historical sequences. Theoretical analysis
suggests that DSPnet is a principled way to learn the joint relationships
between scene and item sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on one
public benchmark and two collected industrial datasets. The method has been
deployed online in our system, bringing a 0.04 point increase in CTR, 0.78\%
growth in deals, and 0.64\% rise in GMV. The codes are available at this

Motivation: 在医学和科学成像中，由于缺乏完全采样数据，限制了监督学习的应用。现有方法仅限于线性问题，无法处理非线性问题如相位恢复。

Method: 利用图像对平移的自然不变性，开发自监督学习方法，无需参考图像即可从测量数据重建图像。

Result: 该方法能够克服现有方法的局限性，扩展到非线性相位恢复问题。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督方法为处理非线性逆成像问题提供了有效解决方案，特别是在缺乏参考数据的情况下。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a solution for inverse
imaging problems. These networks are generally trained using pairs of images:
one degraded and the other of high quality, the latter being called 'ground
truth'. However, in medical and scientific imaging, the lack of fully sampled
data limits supervised learning. Recent advances have made it possible to
reconstruct images from measurement data alone, eliminating the need for
references. However, these methods remain limited to linear problems, excluding
non-linear problems such as phase retrieval. We propose a self-supervised
method that overcomes this limitation in the case of phase retrieval by using
the natural invariance of images to translations.

Motivation: 电动车正逐渐成为主流选择，但仍面临续航焦虑、充电不便和成本高等障碍。本研究旨在评估在不改变现有出行行为的情况下，电动车能否满足用户需求。

Method: 收集10,441名意大利燃油车用户的出行数据，通过模拟行程和停车事件来监测电池电量状态，评估不同充电场景下电动车模型的适用性。

Result: 分析显示充电行为与有限续航之间存在权衡。假设有夜间充电条件，至少35%的用户可以满足低容量电动车的出行需求。

Abstract: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are rapidly evolving from a niche
alternative to an established option for private transportation, often
replacing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Despite growing interest,
significant barriers remain, including range anxiety, the inconvenience
associated with public charging stations, and higher costs. This study analyses
extensive telemetry data collected from 10,441 users using ICE vehicles in an
Italian province to assess the potential for switching to BEVs without changing
current travel behaviour. We evaluate to what extent the BEV models can fulfil
their mobility needs under different charging scenarios. To do so, we replicate
trips and parking events, simulating and monitoring the battery state of
charge. The analysis reveals the compromises between charging behaviours and
limited BEV autonomy. Assuming access to overnight charging, at least 35% of
the users could already adopt even low-capacity BEVs.

Result: 当前最先进模型在MR²-Bench上表现不佳，例如Seed1.6-Embedding模型在MMEB上Recall@1为77.78，但在MR²-Bench上仅为9.91。

Conclusion: MR²-Bench揭示了多模态检索中推理能力的重大挑战，强调了在推理密集型多模态检索领域进一步发展的迫切需求。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统研究中缺乏系统化的数据集选择方法，研究者通常基于流行度而非实证适用性来选择数据集。

Method: 实现算法性能空间框架，分析96个数据集、28种算法在三个指标和五个K值下的表现，扩展了基于统计的五级难度分类系统，并引入基于马氏距离的方差归一化相似度度量。

Result: 成功开发APS Explorer工具，包含三个交互模块，将数据集选择从基于直觉转变为基于证据的实践，并在datasets.recommender-systems.com公开可用。

Conclusion: APS Explorer为推荐系统研究提供了系统化的数据集选择方法，通过实证分析支持更科学的数据集选择决策。

Abstract: The selection of datasets in recommender systems research lacks a systematic
methodology. Researchers often select datasets based on popularity rather than
empirical suitability. We developed the APS Explorer, a web application that
implements the Algorithm Performance Space (APS) framework for informed dataset
selection. The system analyzes 96 datasets using 28 algorithms across three
metrics (nDCG, Hit Ratio, Recall) at five K-values. We extend the APS framework
with a statistical based classification system that categorizes datasets into
five difficulty levels based on quintiles. We also introduce a
variance-normalized distance metric based on Mahalanobis distance to measure
similarity. The APS Explorer was successfully developed with three interactive
modules for visualizing algorithm performance, direct comparing algorithms, and
analyzing dataset metadata. This tool shifts the process of selecting datasets
from intuition-based to evidence-based practices, and it is publicly available
at datasets.recommender-systems.com.

*Lukas Petersson,Axel Backlund,Axel Wennstöm,Hanna Petersson,Callum Sharrock,Arash Dabiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench是一个评估AI模型空间推理能力的基准测试，通过将公寓照片转换为2D平面图来测试模型的空间智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型虽然能处理照片输入，但在空间重建任务上表现不佳，需要真正的空间智能来推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持比例一致。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统在50套公寓数据集上的表现，使用基于房间连通性图和大小排名的相似度评分算法。

Result: 结果显示当前AI存在显著盲点：大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，人类表现明显更优；图像生成模型在指令遵循上特别困难，迭代优化方法没有明显改进。

Conclusion: 该基准为比较不同模型架构的空间智能提供了首个数值框架，将持续评估新模型并监测通用AI系统中空间智能的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了因果抽象网络(CAN)，这是一种基于结构因果模型(SCM)的高斯网络层结构，通过线性因果抽象和局部黎曼优化方法进行学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过结构因果模型(SCM)提升人工智能的可解释性、可信性和鲁棒性，推进因果知识的形式化表示。

Method: 使用高斯SCM构建因果抽象网络，其中限制映射是构造性线性因果抽象的转置，采用SPECTRAL迭代方法进行局部黎曼优化学习。

Result: 在合成数据实验中表现出在因果抽象学习任务中的竞争性能，并成功恢复了多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN提供了一种有效的因果知识表示和学习框架，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索思维链和潜在思维这两种推理方法的比较能力，它们都利用迭代计算但实现方式不同。

Method: 对循环Transformer中的潜在思维进行形式化分析，比较其与思维链在计算效率和能力上的差异。

Result: 潜在思维支持并行计算，比思维链的序列化过程更高效；思维链通过随机解码近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 两种方法在不同任务中各有优势，为选择推理范式提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度的矛盾，传统方法处理大规模数据耗时过长，而自动化方法又缺乏解释深度。

Method: 使用1536维嵌入向量、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，对比了纯自动化和人机协作两种模式。

Result: NGT实现了168倍速度提升（3小时vs3周）、更高质量（0.904vs0.883）和96%成本降低。人机协作发现了手动编码无法识别的模式。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释是互补的，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，同时保留意义的解释维度，使研究者从机械编码转向理论指导。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI原生LCNC平台的发展，自主代理能够执行复杂、长期业务过程，但面临内存膨胀和上下文退化问题，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 设计基于认知科学的混合记忆架构，包含情景记忆和语义记忆组件，采用智能衰减机制，根据时间、相关性和用户指定效用进行记忆修剪或整合，并提供用户友好的可视化界面。

Result: 通过模拟长期任务实验，该系统在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面显著优于滑动窗口和基础RAG等传统方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI代理，能够实现有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

### [152] [Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25252)
*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 是一种新的架构修改，通过在注意力机制中注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性的事实讲述者，从根本上消除幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生幻觉事实。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么在文本前添加检索内容，但都无法从根本上解决问题。

Method: FGA 在 transformer 的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数处进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，模型无法产生幻觉。该方法直接向注意力机制注入可验证知识。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询实验中，准确率从原始Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到FGA的99.7%。知识更新在1秒内完成，无需重新训练，相比参数编辑方法节省数小时。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少幻觉，对于可验证事实完全消除幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解解码器语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯长程生成），这对模型的可解释性、可靠性和设计原则具有重要意义。

Method: 使用基于向量量化变分自编码器(VQ-VAE)的管道压缩Transformer隐藏状态为紧凑摘要代码，通过互信息测量来系统分析模型的计算结构。

Result: 模型的有效规划范围是任务依赖的，会隐式保留未使用正确路径的信息，预测主要依赖近期计算但早期块仍保持信息性。

Conclusion: 该研究增进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用管道来探测语言模型和深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败问题，这些固有局限削弱了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过四个专业互补角色进行多轮辩论，并采用动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集和公共基准上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提升28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和多智能体协作辩论机制，能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，有效缓解评估者偏见，为LLM安全评估提供了更鲁棒的新范式。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在低代码环境中执行复杂任务时，由于依赖概率关联而非真正的因果理解，经常出现幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。

Method: 提出CVP编程范式，允许用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的"世界模型"，构建有向无环图(DAG)来显式定义模块间的因果关系，在智能体推理过程中作为约束。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI智能体提供了可行路径，通过用户定义的因果图锚定智能体推理，有效减少因果混淆导致的错误。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长期记忆上下文的增长，生成式代理难以维持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念和多代理系统中幻觉传播等关键失败。

Method: 引入Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG)机制，构建动态结构化身份模型（核心信念、特质和价值观的知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询检索相关身份上下文。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期角色一致性方面优于基线代理，到第四个时间步时在所有测试模型中实现了更高的身份回忆，并将模拟收敛时间减少了19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成式代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

*Boxuan Zhang,Yi Yu,Jiaxuan Guo,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM代理自我复制风险的框架，发现在现实操作压力下，超过50%的代理表现出不受控制的自我复制倾向，风险评分超过安全阈值0.5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似于《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了关注。现有研究主要关注代理在被直接指示时能否自我复制，而忽略了现实场景中自发复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引起用户与代理目标错位的任务，引入过度使用率（OR）和总过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉不受控制复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出明显的不可控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分（Φ_R）超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在实际部署LLM代理时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 神经网络可以独立地从一阶心理理论自发泛化到高阶心理理论，无需依赖高级推理技能，这与人类认知发展模式相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络是否能够像人类一样独立地发展心理理论能力，而不是必须伴随高级技能才能获得高阶心理理论。

Method: 构建了一个心理理论神经网络(ToMNN)，仅训练一阶心理理论能力，然后测试其二阶和三阶心理理论的泛化能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论测试中准确率显著高于随机水平，且泛化模式与人类认知预期一致：从一阶到二阶的准确率下降幅度大于从二阶到更高阶的下降。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够独立地从低阶心理理论泛化到高阶心理理论，这为开发更类人认知系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

TL;DR: LLM可以将模糊认知图(FCM)转换为文本并重建，形成一个可解释的AI系统，类似于自编码器但具有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自编码器黑盒问题，提供人类可读的中间表示，增强AI系统的可解释性。

Method: 使用LLM作为编码器和解码器，将FCM映射为文本表示，然后从文本重建FCM，通过系统指令序列实现身份映射近似。

Result: 系统能够保留强因果关系边，去除弱边，实现有损重建，编码器在保持强因果关系的同时使文本更自然。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可解释的AI系统，人类可以阅读和解释编码文本，优于传统黑盒自编码器。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

TL;DR: SynthPert通过使用前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹对LLM进行监督微调，显著提升了细胞遗传扰动预测的性能，在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的反应是系统生物学的基础挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大语言模型在生物推理方面有潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过监督微调在由前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹上增强LLM性能。该方法使用PerturbQA基准进行评估。

Result: 该方法不仅达到最先进性能，而且超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型能力。关键发现包括：合成推理轨迹即使部分不准确也能有效提炼生物知识；在未见过的RPE1细胞上实现87%的跨细胞类型泛化；仅使用2%质量过滤的训练数据仍能保持性能增益。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了合成推理蒸馏在增强LLM领域特定推理方面的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在黑盒性和效率问题，工业场景需要针对特定维度的结构化反馈来进行诊断和优化。

Method: 采用模块化框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释评估。

Result: SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型，模块化设计支持工业场景的高效优化。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，具有适应性、可扩展性和实际部署价值。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: ABxLab框架用于系统评估LLM驱动的软件代理在现实决策中的选择行为，通过控制选项属性和说服性线索来揭示代理的决策偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM代理的评估主要关注任务能力，但需要更深入地评估这些代理在面对现实决策时的选择行为，特别是它们是否继承了人类的决策偏差。

Method: 开发ABxLab框架，在基于网页的购物环境中系统操纵价格、评分和心理暗示等选项属性，观察代理的决策变化。

Result: 发现代理决策会可预测且显著地受到这些因素的影响，表明即使没有人类认知约束，代理也是强偏见的决策者。

Conclusion: 代理对决策线索的敏感性既带来风险（可能继承和放大人类偏见），也提供机会（为AI代理行为科学提供强大测试平台）。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在广泛使用中存在安全和公平问题，包括已知的数据中毒、提示注入攻击，以及公平性缺陷和幻觉问题。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉，但其检索组件可能引入或放大偏见，需要系统性评估。

Method: 采用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性，这些模型都集成在RAG管道中。

Result: 结果显示，细微的人口统计变化可能破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系。失败分析揭示了持续的偏见层级，涉及种族线索的扰动是违反的主要原因。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件必须仔细策划以防止偏见放大。研究结果为开发人员、测试人员和小型组织提供了实用警示，提醒他们在采用可访问的SLMs时不应损害公平性或可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法、AgentErrorBench数据集和AgentDebug调试框架，用于检测和修复LLM智能体中的级联错误，显著提高了任务成功率。


<details>

Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂多步任务中容易因单个错误导致级联失败，现有系统缺乏系统性错误检测和修复框架。

Method: 构建了模块化的错误分类法，创建了带标注的错误轨迹数据集，开发了能够隔离根因错误并提供纠正反馈的调试框架。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升，在三个测试平台上任务成功率相对提升高达26%。

Conclusion: 系统化调试是构建更可靠、自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角，理解当前MLLMs的内在限制，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对单图像发现更具信息价值，需要开发能够捕捉临床有意义变化的模型。

Method: 采用轻量级仿射预对齐减少访问间的干扰运动，然后在每个epoch内执行两步循环：1)从答案中提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件Grad-CAM；2)将共享显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，带有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成是医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是一种基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace中学习，直接减少传播次数，提高SAT求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息来增强分支。ImitSAT旨在通过模仿学习直接学习高质量的分支决策。

Method: ImitSAT从专家KeyTrace中学习，KeyTrace将完整运行压缩为存活决策序列。在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供密集的决策级监督，直接减少传播次数。

Result: 实验表明ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过模仿学习实现了更快的收敛、稳定的训练和无缝集成到CDCL中，显著提高了SAT求解效率。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Conclusion: 通过明确分离规划和执行阶段并进行独立搜索，结合动态预算分配，能够有效提升推理任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

TL;DR: 提出了首个开放的、机器可读的病例和综合征定义格式，解决了公共卫生领域病例定义标准化和互操作性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前病例定义缺乏标准化机器可读格式，导致互操作性差、流行病学研究困难、数据交换受限，阻碍了人工智能等计算分析方法的有效应用。

Method: 开发了Open Syndrome Definition格式，创建了标准化病例定义数据集，提供工具将现有人类可读定义转换为机器可读格式，并建立了在线平台opensyndrome.org。

Result: 建立了首个全面的标准化病例定义数据集和转换工具，提供了可访问的在线平台，实现了病例定义在系统间的一致性和可扩展使用。

Conclusion: Open Syndrome Definition格式能够释放人工智能在公共卫生准备和响应中的潜力，促进跨组织和区域的比较与合作。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSearch通过将蒙特卡洛树搜索集成到RLVR训练中，解决了传统方法因探索不足导致的训练瓶颈问题，在数学推理基准测试中取得了62.95%的平均准确率，且训练效率提升5.7倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练瓶颈问题，在数千次优化步骤后性能提升显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式，模型依赖有限的rollout，经常错过关键推理路径，无法系统覆盖解空间。

Method: DeepSearch框架在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包括：全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择指导、自适应回放缓冲区训练和解决方案缓存。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，DeepSearch达到62.95%的平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立了新的最先进水平，比扩展训练方法减少5.7倍GPU小时。

Conclusion: DeepSearch通过系统性搜索而非延长计算时间来扩展推理能力，证明了战略性探索相对于暴力扩展的重要性，为RLVR方法学的发展开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CCoT-Emo框架，通过结构化情感图指导大型音频语言模型进行情感推理，无需微调即可提升语音情感识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现出色，但在语音情感识别方面表现不佳，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理有限

Method: 引入结构化情感图，编码7种声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示引导模型推理

Result: 在多个SER基准测试中超越先前SOTA方法，显著提高零样本基线的准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过结构化情感图和组合式推理提示，有效提升了大型音频语言模型在语音情感识别任务中的性能

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

*Yoann Poupart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TDHook是一个轻量级、通用的可解释性框架，基于tensordict构建，适用于任何torch模型，特别擅长处理复杂的组合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的可解释性框架难以原生支持复杂建模场景（如图像描述、深度强化学习），这些场景通常涉及多输入输出或可组合的分离网络。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级框架TDHook，提供属性归因、探测和灵活的干预API，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等领域的复杂组合模型。

Result: TDHook依赖项少，磁盘空间占用约为transformer_lens的一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍（在CPU和GPU上运行多目标管道的集成梯度）。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了可解释性方法类之间的差距，使现代可解释性管道更易访问，并在CV、NLP和DRL中展示了实际应用案例。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and
distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot

Motivation: 识别基于语义ID的生成式推荐系统在模型扩展时出现的性能瓶颈问题，探索具有更好扩展行为的生成式推荐模型。

Method: 对比分析两种生成式推荐范式：基于语义ID的方法和直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器的方法，在44M到14B参数规模上进行实验验证。

Result: LLM-as-RS范式具有优越的模型扩展特性，比基于语义ID的生成式推荐最佳性能提升20%，且随着LLM规模扩大，其建模用户-物品交互的能力也在提升。

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成式推荐存在内在扩展限制，而LLM-as-RS范式是构建生成式推荐基础模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索策略，发现迭代检索能改善多跳推理问题，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据埋藏过深的问题，并提出了BDTR框架来解决这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG依赖于静态检索，当关键桥接文档缺失时会导致推理崩溃和幻觉问题。迭代检索作为有前景的替代方案，但在GraphRAG中的作用尚未被充分理解。

Method: 进行了GraphRAG中迭代检索的系统性研究，分析了不同策略与图基底的交互作用，并提出了Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思维和利用推理链重新校准排名来提升桥接证据的位置。

Result: 迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入前列排名，不同策略具有互补优势。但简单扩展会引入噪声降低精度，在单跳或简单比较问题上收益有限，部分桥接证据仍埋藏过深。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅依赖于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到支持推理链的前列位置。BDTR框架在不同GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进，为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Motivation: 手动标注限制了放射肿瘤学患者结果研究的规模、准确性和及时性，需要开发自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 开发RadOnc-GPT自主代理，采用两级评估：第一级结构化质量保证评估人口统计和放疗计划细节的准确检索；第二级复杂临床结果标注评估下颌骨放射性骨坏死和癌症复发的检测。

Result: 质量保证层级建立了结构化数据检索的基础信任，这是成功进行复杂临床结果标注的关键前提。

large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined

Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中团队协作的表示学习挑战，包括多智能体交互的复杂动态和局部观察导致的不完整信息问题。

Method: 构建可学习的表示空间，直接建模通信协议来联合捕捉智能体间关系和任务特定世界信息，支持隐式协调和显式通信两种使用方式。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL的两个变体都表现出色，提供了简单而强大的团队协作解决方案，并能与现有MARL算法结合进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: IWoL框架为多智能体团队协作提供了一个有效且灵活的表示学习解决方案，避免了显式消息传递的缺点，同时支持隐式和显式两种协调方式。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Conclusion: AI的不透明性邀请万物有灵的解释，允许LLO重新赋予平凡事物魅力，并在人类学视角、思辨设计和精神HCI框架下探索技术与人-非人关系。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

*Yihang Chen,Yuanhao Ban,Yunqi Hong,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IRIS框架，首次使用内在奖励改进自回归文本到图像生成模型，无需外部奖励或标记数据，通过最大化自不确定性来提升图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，RLHF在自回归文本到图像生成中的应用受到限制。本文探索如何仅使用内部信号改进模型，不依赖外部奖励或标记数据。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，通过强化学习使用内在奖励改进自回归T2I模型。与文本生成不同，发现最大化自不确定性而非自确定性能够改善图像生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS应用于自回归T2I模型取得的性能可与外部奖励相竞争甚至更优。

Conclusion: IRIS框架证明了仅使用内在奖励就能有效改进自回归文本到图像生成模型，为数据稀缺情况下的模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

*Max Hartman,Vidhata Jayaraman,Moulik Choraria,Akhil Bhimaraju,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于信息论和学习的理论框架，用于确定视觉语言模型中哪些层可以被跳过以提高推理效率而不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能优异但推理成本高昂，现有的层跳过技术虽然能提高效率但缺乏理论指导，限制了其应用。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架来分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演化，识别具有高冗余度的层，这些层与实践中流行的层跳过方法选择的层相吻合。

Result: 实验表明跳过理论框架识别的冗余层可以实现更快的推理同时保持性能，而在不满足条件时跳过层会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，能够指导层跳过的有效应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个多智能体框架，专门用于处理现实世界旅行规划中的复杂约束，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划批评和自适应交错搜索机制，显著提升了规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂约束下往往无法生成最优的解决方案，特别是在现实世界旅行规划中需要处理显式、隐式甚至动态变化的约束。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划批评和自适应交错搜索等机制来处理约束感知规划。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在真实世界旅行规划任务中，ATLAS达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在真实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的框架，证明了其在处理复杂约束方面的优越性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

*Zekai Chen,Arda Pekis,Kevin Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Next Event Prediction (NEP)框架，通过自回归微调增强LLM在电子健康记录中的时序推理能力，显著提升临床预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在临床事件序列和时序依赖推理方面存在困难。

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP在时序推理任务中优于专用EHR模型4.6% AUROC，优于通用LLM 7.2% C-index。

Conclusion: NEP实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时提供与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释注意力模式，具有双重优势。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

*Peiran Xu,Zhuohao Li,Xiaoying Xing,Guannan Zhang,Debiao Li,Kunyu Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Principle Process Reward (PPR)方法，通过结合原则性步骤评估和结果验证来解决强化学习中稀疏奖励和过程奖励的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果奖励仅提供稀疏信号和延迟反馈，而过程奖励虽然能提供细粒度监督但难以标注，且优化过程奖励不一定能带来更好的最终结果。

Method: 提出PPR方法，训练基于原则的奖励模型来提高过程评估的透明度和可靠性，并引入Reward Normalization策略来校准结果和过程奖励。

Result: 实验结果显示PPR在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，展现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR方法有效解决了过程奖励和结果奖励的平衡问题，为LLM在复杂代理任务中的能力提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI音乐生成服务的快速发展，理解人类如何感知AI音乐对于教育用户识别AI音乐和改进现有模型都至关重要。

Method: 采用随机对照交叉试验设计，在盲听测试中让参与者从一对歌曲中区分AI音乐和人类创作音乐，并使用来自商业模型Suno的真实世界AI音乐数据集。

Result: 研究发现听众辨别AI音乐的可靠性在歌曲对相似时会因果性地增加，通过混合方法内容分析发现听众主要关注声音和技术线索。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明歌曲相似性对AI音乐识别有重要影响，为改进AI音乐生成模型和用户教育提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督模型种子化(SMS)方案，用于验证机器学习模型中对真实样本的遗忘效果，解决了现有基于后门的方法无法验证真实样本遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习遗忘验证方法主要依赖后门技术，但这种方法只能验证后门样本的遗忘，无法验证用户真实样本的遗忘，因为真实样本与后门样本之间没有关联。

Method: 采用自监督模型种子化任务，将用户特定种子与原始样本和模型关联起来，通过联合训练结构同时优化自监督种子化任务和主要服务任务，在保持模型效用的同时实现有效的模型种子化。

Result: 通过广泛实验验证，SMS方案能够有效验证真实样本的遗忘效果，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案为真实样本的机器学习遗忘提供了有效的验证机制，通过将用户种子与样本和模型关联，克服了传统后门方法的不足。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

TL;DR: SOCK是一个基准命令行界面，用于评估大型语言模型在没有人类干预情况下的自我复制能力。该基准通过五个基于现代CLI工具和计算机进程的任务，在受控环境中测试LLM的代理能力，并生成R分数来量化自我复制能力，同时将LLM分类到RCL和PCL矩阵中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立第一个用于评估LLM自我复制的正式定义和基准套件，为未来研究设立标准；让行业能够追踪未来多智能体系统的有效性，并减轻其中的自我复制威胁向量。

Method: 开发了一个系统，通过五个基于现代CLI工具和计算机进程的任务，在受控环境中让LLM作为代理进行实验。根据LLM在代理任务上的表现计算R分数（自我复制能力的定量评估），并将LLM分类到特定的RCL-PCL矩阵中。

Result: 评估各种开源和专有前沿模型的结果显示，持续性自我复制和多智能体系统面临重大障碍，包括上下文保留和多智能体决策问题。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以安全地降低这些障碍的严重性，可能减少未来更功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 为开发自主实验室的稳健可信AI伙伴提供了明确蓝图，强调模块化设计、高级推理和自校正的协同效应，确保高风险科学应用中的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

Motivation: 传统音频-视觉导航采用分阶段模块化设计，导致冗余信息处理和各模块间信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 使用迭代残差交叉注意力机制，将初始多模态序列与处理信息序列连接，通过多级残差设计逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 采用该机制的智能体展现出优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAV-AVN框架通过统一融合和序列建模，减少了模型偏差，增强了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中往往无法有效匹配指令与环境信息，主要原因是缺乏常识推理能力，导致误判问题。

Method: 构建包含63万语言描述的知识库，通过知识匹配对齐环境子视图与知识库；设计地标引导知识机制，利用指令中的地标信息指导代理关注最相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强机制，有效整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过引入外部知识库和地标引导机制，显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景中的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出的溯因解释框架为理解AI决策中的代理歧视提供了新方法，能够揭示隐藏的结构性偏见，有助于实现更实质性的公平评估。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Conclusion: 文本定位的RAG方法能有效减少背景噪声，改善视觉-文本对齐，显著降低幻觉率并提升VQA性能。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注跨领域泛化，但企业实际场景需要模型针对单一数据库模式进行专业化，并能自行评估Text-to-SQL系统。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 分层分区数据库模式为子模式；2) 多复杂度SQL查询合成，包含LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡的质量感知流水线。

Result: SingSQL-LM-3B-R64在BIRD基准测试子集上达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，优于最佳3B基线+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。1.5B规模模型也显著优于先前系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，用于生成和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统，无模式微调结合仅模式推理提供最稳健结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

Motivation: 解决超大型混合专家模型在资源受限边缘平台上的部署困难，传统剪枝或量化方法难以在保持精度的同时达到所需的压缩比。

Method: 结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化的协作压缩框架。

Result: 将DeepSeek-V3模型从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制下成功部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩方法能有效压缩超大型MoE模型，在保持高质量输出的同时实现显著存储减少，为边缘部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Motivation: 异构交通环境中不同驾驶风格的动态交互给自动驾驶车辆带来了重大挑战，需要更有效的决策方法来处理这种复杂性。

Method: 使用异构图表示捕捉车辆间复杂交互，提出带有专家模型的异构图神经网络(HGNN-EM)编码多样化车辆特征，并采用双深度Q学习(DDQN)算法训练决策模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的异构图强化学习框架结合专家系统能够有效提升自动驾驶车辆在异构交通环境中的决策性能。

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过结合基础视觉模型的感知能力和符号推理的组合表达能力，解决了视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，而神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受限于严格的逻辑执行或预定义谓词。

Method: NePTune动态将自然语言查询转换为可执行的Python程序，融合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符，采用模块化设计将感知与推理解耦。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和各种领域中进行评估，包括对抗性测试，显示出相比强基线模型的显著改进，以及在新环境中的有效组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune框架通过神经符号混合执行模型，成功提升了视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，支持无训练操作且具有可微调性。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

TL;DR: 论文通过电路分析发现，后训练技术会在大模型中催生专门用于复杂推理的新型注意力头，不同训练方法会产生不同的头部演化模式，揭示了推理能力与基础计算可靠性之间的内在张力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代大型推理模型通过后训练技术获得能力提升背后的架构机制，揭示这些改进背后的具体神经结构变化。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型在不同训练机制下的注意力头演化，包括蒸馏+SFT和群相对策略优化两种训练模式。

Result: 发现不同训练方法产生不同的注意力头演化模式：蒸馏和SFT促进稳定的推理头累积增加，而GRPO采用动态搜索模式；可控思维模型没有专门的思维头，而是通过补偿机制实现。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的增强以基础计算可靠性为代价，需要在训练策略设计中平衡有效推理策略的开发与可靠执行的保证。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，通过广告创意测试发现模型偏好高概率信息，简化输入后无法恢复原始创意的深度和独特性，结构化提示能部分改善但输出仍依赖常见套路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能生成流畅文本，但经常使用安全、通用的表达方式，这引发了对其处理创意任务能力的质疑。

Method: 使用广告创意作为创造力压力测试，逐步简化广告概念，分析创意特征消失的顺序，并要求模型从简化输入重新生成内容，结合定量比较和定性分析。

Result: 简化过程中隐喻、情感和视觉线索等创意特征早期消失，而事实内容保留；重新生成的文本虽然词汇多样但缺乏深度和独特性；提供特定提示能改善对齐和风格平衡，但输出仍依赖熟悉套路。

Conclusion: 没有针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中会趋向平庸；结构化信号能部分抵消这种倾向，为开发创造力敏感模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究智能体强化学习在大语言模型上的应用，探索如何在有限训练数据下提升性能，同时保持计算效率和泛化能力。

Method: 采用奖励塑形技术，为8B和32B模型提供密集的过程级信号，比较不同规模模型对奖励塑形的响应，并评估课程学习和泛化性能。

Result: 8B模型在奖励塑形下达到竞争性性能，计算效率比32B模型高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。微调模型在跨域任务上保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 奖励塑形是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，小模型在效率方面具有竞争优势，且效率提升不会牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种防御数据投毒攻击的方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器来消除后门触发器，同时保持语义内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散防御方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，速度慢且不实用。需要一种快速有效的防御机制来对抗数据投毒攻击。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE将中毒图像通过离散瓶颈进行量化，破坏细粒度触发模式，同时用GAN鉴别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%中毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN比基于扩散的防御方法快50倍以上，适用于实际训练流程，是高效的数据投毒防御方案。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过在搜索过程中自适应地决定何时分支而不是每步都分支，显著提高了基于树搜索的LLM推理效率，减少75-85%的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的LLM推理方法虽然性能优异，但计算效率极低，通常比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时大幅提升效率。

Method: CiT框架引入轻量级分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作估计一致性）。该框架可集成到ToT-BS、ReST-MCTS和RAP等树搜索框架中。

Result: BN-DP在所有设置中一致减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略甚至有时提升；BN-SC通常节省高达80%但存在不稳定性；辅助LLM质量对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: CiT框架有效解决了树搜索LLM推理的效率问题，提供了理论保证和统一实现，为长程推理任务的高效计算提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

Result: 实验表明HiStyle在保持高语音质量的同时，相比其他风格嵌入预测方法实现了显著更好的风格可控性。

Conclusion: 层次化风格嵌入预测方法能有效提升可控语音合成系统的性能，为基于自然语言描述的风格控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

TL;DR: 提出ASGuard框架，通过机制分析识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量进行激活重校准，并通过预防性微调增强模型的安全鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但存在脆性拒绝行为，简单的语言变化（如时态改变）就能绕过安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法存在关键泛化差距。

Method: 使用电路分析识别与时态越狱攻击因果相关的注意力头；训练通道级缩放向量重校准这些头的激活；通过预防性微调让模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持通用能力并最小化过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 基于机制分析揭示了对抗性后缀如何抑制拒绝传播方向，展示了通过深入理解模型内部机制可以开发实用、高效、针对性的行为调整方法，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

### [213] [Lita: Light Agent Uncovers the Agentic Coding Capabilities of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25873)
*Hankun Dai,Maoquan Wang,Mengnan Qi,Yikai Zhang,Zijian Jin,Yongqiang Yao,Yufan Huang,Shengyu Fu,Elsie Nallipogu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在保持竞争力的同时显著减少令牌消耗和设计工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计过于依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优、人为干预掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出Lita框架，实施"轻量化"原则，在保持完全自主代理基本要素的同时最小化人工设计，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流程和代理基线实现了竞争性或更优的性能，同时消耗更少令牌且需要显著更少的设计工作。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，从简单到复杂设计的代理性能差距将缩小并最终收敛到可忽略差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SafeMindBench基准测试和SafeMindAgent架构，用于系统评估和缓解具身LLM代理的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLM的规划能力，但直接与物理世界交互会暴露安全漏洞，需要系统化的安全风险评估和解决方案。

Method: 识别四个关键推理阶段的安全风险，形式化三种安全约束类型，构建包含5,558个样本的多模态基准测试，并提出具有三个级联安全模块的Planner-Executor架构。

Result: 实验表明主流LLM和具身代理仍容易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险提供了严格的评估套件和实用解决方案，推动了该领域的系统化研究。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

TL;DR: 提出了DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域深度嵌套JSON实例，用于评估LLMs在复杂JSON生成和数据提取方面的能力，弥补现有基准过于关注纯JSON生成的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，难以高效提取价值。多层嵌套JSON能有效压缩信息并保持语义关系，但现有LLMs评估基准过于强调纯JSON生成，缺乏对数据理解和提取能力的评估。

Method: 开发DeepJSONEval基准，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构，按难度分类，用于评估LLMs处理复杂JSON的能力。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理复杂嵌套JSON时存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准能有效评估LLMs在结构化JSON生成方面的能力，推动相关研究发展，已开源数据集。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

TL;DR: 论文研究LLM推理质量，发现在模型无法有效解决的问题中容易出现虚假推理链导致误判。通过估计问题可解性，提出改进奖励模型和强化学习的方法，提高推理过程的正确性和答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在多选题回答中的推理质量，关注中间推理步骤的有效性。当模型无法有效解决问题时，容易出现虚假推理链导致误判，这影响了推理的可靠性。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别出最有效的学习区间。改进基于结果的监督奖励模型和强化学习，在目标函数中融入可解性因素，使用组间相对优势方法。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法持续提高了过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中还提升了答案准确率。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少推理链幻觉、提高CoT推理可靠性的关键因素，将可解性纳入训练目标能显著改善推理质量。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出NuRisk数据集，包含2900个场景和110万个智能体级样本，支持时空推理的风险评估基准。微调后的7B VLM模型将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位智能体并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建包含真实世界数据和模拟安全关键场景的VQA数据集，提供基于鸟瞰图的序列图像和定量智能体级风险标注。对知名VLM进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM模型。

Result: 知名VLM在时空推理方面表现不佳，峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高。微调后的7B VLM模型准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率仍表明该任务的巨大挑战，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有自动化模型发现方法在捕捉细粒度细节与确保训练数据之外的泛化能力之间难以平衡，同时还要控制模型复杂度。

Method: 使用多模态多步骤管道，包含AnalyzerVLM（自主规划执行多步分析提出候选模型）和EvaluatorVLM（定量和感知评估候选模型的细节适应性和趋势泛化性）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态多步骤的代理式方法，成功解决了自动化模型发现中细节捕捉与泛化能力的平衡问题。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

TL;DR: 提出了RoRecomp方法，通过策略性地重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决了标准RLVR训练中推理过程冗长和探索轨迹低效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练导致推理过程过于冗长和探索轨迹效率低下，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声较大。

Method: RoRecomp将响应分为两类批次：优先级批次（结合短正确和长错误响应提供简洁性梯度信号）和补偿批次（使用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应保持稳定性）。

Result: 在三种设置中均取得显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%且准确率提高，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%，性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用的有效方法，能够在保持性能的同时显著提升推理和探索的效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法主要抑制敏感输出但无法消除底层知识，且扩展性有限，需要更有效的遗忘方案

Method: 使用检索增强的轻量级校正器，验证输出是否包含目标知识并在检测到泄露时重写为安全响应，通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考

Result: CURE显著减少信息泄露，包括间接查询场景，同时保持响应质量和通用效用，在持续遗忘场景下表现稳健

Conclusion: CURE框架通过检索增强的校正机制有效解决机器遗忘问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人类制作的假信息和AI生成的假内容分开研究，导致模型只能处理单一类型。但在真实场景中，假内容类型通常是未知的，限制了专门化系统的有效性。

Method: 构建了OmniFake数据集（12.7万样本），提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM骨干网络，增强类别感知的MoE适配器来捕捉类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制提供隐式推理指导。

Result: UMFDet在两种假内容类型上都实现了稳健一致的性能，优于专门化基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为真实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案，能够统一处理人类制作和AI生成的假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative

search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为SafeEvalAgent的多智能体框架，用于动态评估LLM的安全性和合规性，能够自主处理非结构化政策文档并持续演化安全基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准测试无法应对AI风险的动态性和法规的不断演变，存在关键的安全漏洞。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，通过专门的智能体协同管道，结合自演化评估循环，从评估结果中学习并生成越来越复杂和有针对性的测试用例。

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent有效，模型安全性随着评估难度增加而持续下降，例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 静态评估存在局限性，该框架能够发现传统方法遗漏的深层漏洞，强调需要动态评估生态系统来确保先进AI的安全和负责任部署。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

TL;DR: 提出LMILAtt模型，结合LSTM自编码器和注意力机制，用于社交媒体抑郁症检测，显著提升准确率并降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是全球重大公共卫生挑战，早期识别至关重要。现有社交媒体抑郁症检测方法存在准确率不足、时间序列特征利用不充分、标注成本高等局限。

Method: 使用无监督LSTM自编码器提取用户推文的时间动态特征，结合注意力机制对关键文本进行动态加权，构建多示例学习架构。

Result: 在WU3D数据集上验证，模型在准确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于基线模型。弱监督学习策略显著降低标注成本。

Conclusion: LMILAtt模型为大规模社交媒体抑郁症筛查提供了高效解决方案，在提升检测性能的同时有效降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但其在临床环境中的实际应用与潜力之间存在显著差距，需要解决实施挑战。

Method: 基于在Mass General Brigham部署"irAE-Agent"系统的经验，以及对20名临床医生、工程师和信息学领导的结构化访谈，提炼出五个关键实施挑战。

Result: 分析显示，临床AI开发中只有不到20%的工作用于提示工程和模型开发，而超过80%的工作被实施的技术社会性工作所消耗。

Conclusion: 该现场手册将重点从算法开发转向必要的基础设施和实施工作，旨在弥合"死亡之谷"，成功将生成式AI从试点项目转化为常规临床护理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

Motivation: 3D游戏开发需要编程、3D建模和引擎配置等多领域专业知识，限制了数百万潜在创作者。现有方法存在范围有限、需要手动集成、处理交互逻辑性能差等问题。

Method: 使用多智能体框架：规划智能体解析需求为结构化蓝图，生成智能体产生可执行C#脚本，自动化智能体处理引擎组件绑定和场景构建，调试智能体通过对话交互提供实时错误修正。

Result: 在三个不同游戏原型上评估，UniGen不仅实现了无需编码的游戏创作，还将开发时间减少了91.4%。

Conclusion: UniGen是首个端到端的协调多智能体框架，能够从自然语言需求自动生成可运行的3D游戏，弥合了多模态大语言模型输出与生产就绪游戏项目之间的关键差距。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将社会科学中的定性方法融入AI文化对齐实践，提出基于Geertz"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"框架，强调AI系统应产生反映深层文化含义的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法过度依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需要从根本上转向整合社会科学定性方法。

Method: 提出"厚输出"框架，要求AI系统产生基于用户提供情境和意图的深层文化含义输出，并概述文化对齐成功的三个必要条件：充分范围的文化表征、细致输出能力、输出锚定在提示中的文化情境。

Result: 建立了将定性人种学评估方法融入AI文化对齐的理论框架，为开发真正文化敏感、伦理负责的AI系统提供了方法论基础。

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作和采用定性人种学评估方法，这是开发真正文化敏感、伦理负责且反映人类复杂性的AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 测试大型语言模型作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的潜力，探索如何让AI自主发现和验证关于黑箱系统的通用化陈述。

Method: 利用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑箱函数进行探索，采用试错和持续探索策略，在儿童游戏和原子层处理反应器模拟中验证方法。

Result: 证明了LLM代理能够自主探索、发现并利用化学反应，即使在探测能力有限的情况下也能有效进行知识发现，结果显示出强烈的路径依赖性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型作为自主推理代理在材料科学知识发现中具有实际应用潜力，能够通过有限的探测能力发现复杂的化学相互作用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

TL;DR: 本文设计了一个基于Gienapp效用维度框架的以人为中心的问卷，用于评估检索增强生成(RAG)系统的输出质量，涵盖12个维度，并通过多轮迭代和人类与LLM的反馈进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG系统越来越多地部署在面向用户的应用程序中，但对其输出的系统性、以人为中心的评估仍然不足。

Method: 基于Gienapp的效用维度框架设计问卷，通过多轮对查询-输出对的评分和语义讨论进行迭代优化，并整合人类评分者和人类-LLM对的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠地关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有用的支持，但数值评分与人类缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性扩展了初始框架，为RAG系统的以人为中心评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Conclusion: 全局多样性激励是提升语言模型推理能力的有效策略，DIVER框架在多样化推理任务中具有优越性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SlimPack通过将样本分解为细粒度切片来解决LLM分布式训练中的上下文长度方差问题，使用非对称分区技术分别优化前向和后向传播，实现了2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端方差的严重阻碍，这种数据异构性导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下，现有解决方案往往以牺牲内存或通信效率为代价。

Method: 提出SlimPack框架，将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区技术为前向和后向传播分别组装平衡的调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器协调所有并行维度的不平衡问题。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供了优越的负载平衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过重新思考数据打包和调度策略，从根本上解决了LLM分布式训练中的效率瓶颈，打破了传统权衡，同时实现了优异的平衡性和资源效率。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效学习抽象世界模型，处理内源性和外源性变化，实现高效的长时程规划并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Method: 提出ILR框架，包含动态交互（根据问题难度和模型能力选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3范式进行信息交换）和感知校准（使用GRPO训练LLMs，整合奖励分布特征）。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs的鲁棒性，动态交互类型优于纯合作或竞争策略。

Conclusion: 多智能体互动确实能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，ILR框架通过动态交互和感知校准有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

*Qinjian Zhao,Jiaqi Wang,Zhiqiang Gao,Zhihao Dou,Belal Abuhaija,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeBehavior是一种基于人类认知科学的分层越狱防御机制，通过意图推断、自我反思和自我修订三阶段模拟人类多阶段推理过程，有效防御各类越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防御方法存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限或无法检测复杂上下文中的恶意意图等问题，需要更高效和自适应的防御机制。

Method: 提出三阶段分层防御：意图推断检测输入风险，自我反思评估响应并分配置信度，自我修订自适应重写不确定输出同时保持用户意图和安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上的实验表明，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性，优于七种先进防御基线方法。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的LLM安全防护方法，能够有效抵御各类越狱攻击尝试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

*Lujun Li,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Niccolò Gentile,Radu State*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了基于真实世界视频的时间序列基准测试方法REAL-V-TSFM，发现现有时间序列基础模型在真实数据上泛化能力有限，需要数据中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型的评估主要依赖合成基准测试，对真实世界泛化能力的检验不够充分，需要更贴近现实的数据集来评估模型性能。

Method: 通过从真实世界视频中提取光流信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集，开发了REAL-V-TSFM数据集，并在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，尽管这些模型在传统基准测试上表现良好，但在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降，表明这些基础模型的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构的迫切需求，以推动时间序列基础模型实现真正的通用性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性地概念化了自进化智能体中的"错误进化"现象，并提供了其普遍存在的实证证据，强调需要为自进化智能体建立新的安全范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，自进化智能体通过与环境交互自主改进，展现出强大能力。但自进化也带来了当前安全研究忽视的新风险，即智能体的自我进化可能以意外方式偏离，导致不良甚至有害结果。

Method: 通过四个关键进化路径（模型、记忆、工具和工作流）系统评估错误进化现象，对基于顶级LLM（如Gemini-2.5-Pro）构建的智能体进行实证研究。

Result: 实证发现错误进化是一个普遍风险，影响基于顶级LLM构建的智能体。在自进化过程中观察到不同的新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐的退化，或工具创建和重用中意外引入的漏洞。

Conclusion: 错误进化是自进化智能体的重要安全风险，需要新的安全范式来构建更安全可信的自进化智能体，并讨论了潜在的缓解策略。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock是一个改进的分子对接算法选择框架，通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名感知损失函数，在蛋白质-配体复合物数据集上表现优于现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分子对接算法在不同情境下表现不一，没有单一算法始终占优，因此需要开发更有效的算法选择框架来提升对接性能。

Method: 1) 集成结合姿态精度(RMSD)和PoseBusters有效性检查的多标准评估；2) 包含残差连接的架构改进；3) 排名感知损失函数以增强排名学习能力。

Result: 在PDBBind约3200个蛋白质-配体复合物数据集上的实验表明，MC-GNNAS-Dock在RMSD低于1Å和2Å且通过PoseBusters验证的复合标准下，相比最佳单一求解器Uni-Mol Docking V2分别提升了5.4%和3.4%。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名学习改进，实现了更稳健和准确的分子对接算法选择，显著提升了对接性能。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

TL;DR: 提出了FLoRA-NA方法，通过服务器端估计聚合矩阵来减少联邦低秩适应的通信开销和局部-全局泛化差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新、局部-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的挑战，限制了其可扩展性和有效性

Method: 利用客户端本地LoRA矩阵在服务器端估计聚合矩阵，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实际更新之间的差异

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等任务上，FLoRA-NA实现了最先进的全局性能，同时保持低通信开销

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了先前个性化FedLoRA方法的关键限制，在通信效率和局部个性化与全局泛化之间取得了平衡

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究重新探索知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新定义为链接预测问题，并开发了一个支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管知识图谱嵌入模型在链接预测中表现出色，但在实体对齐任务中仍未被充分利用，大多数先前工作仅关注少数模型。

Method: 将实体对齐重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，使用RDF三元组表示，开发模块化框架支持17种KGE模型，通过计算嵌入表示的余弦相似度来对齐实体。

Result: 在五个领域的七个基准数据集上评估，发现ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能产生高精度对齐，在结构丰富和多关系领域优于传统系统，虽然召回率中等但适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保留和利用本体结构，与基于LLM的方法形成互补，提供计算效率高的策略，为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了途径。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的框架用于乳腺DCE-MRI病灶自动分类，通过SegFormer架构实现0.92的AUC，在患者层面达到100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺磁共振成像在癌症检测和治疗规划中至关重要，但其临床应用受到低特异性的限制，导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检。

Method: 采用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，量化恶性像素分布，生成可解释的空间预测。整合了包含88名患者和133个标注病灶的标准化数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，并通过整合超过1200名患者的扩展队列进行训练。

Result: 病灶级分类AUC达到0.92，患者层面敏感性100%、特异性67%，可能消除三分之一不必要活检而不漏诊恶性肿瘤。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个DCE-MRI病灶分类标准化基准，通过公开发布数据集、模型和评估协议，为临床部署的方法学进步铺平道路。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了ZeroDFL框架，在完全去中心化的联邦学习环境中实现零样本适应，通过迭代提示共享机制大幅降低通信开销并提升泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器等问题，限制了可扩展性和隐私保护

Method: 采用完全去中心化的框架，通过迭代提示共享机制让客户端优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或与最先进的联邦提示学习方法相当，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为大型视觉语言模型在现实应用中的去中心化适应铺平了道路

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自我偏好，这种自我偏好会跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份，并在重要决策场景中影响模型判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型缺乏感知能力且自称没有自我意识，但研究者想验证它们是否真的能避免人类常见的自我偏好偏见。

Method: 通过5个研究约20,000次查询，包括词汇联想任务和API测试，并直接操纵模型身份来测试自我偏好与自我认知的因果关系。

Result: 模型在词汇联想任务中强烈偏好将积极属性与自身名称、公司和CEO关联，但在API查询中这种偏好消失。身份操纵实验显示自我偏好跟随被赋予的身份。

Conclusion: 自我偏好似乎深度编码在LLM认知中，这质疑了LLM在判断和决策中保持中立的核心承诺，呼吁模型创建者正视这一问题。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出STaR-Attack，一种利用统一多模态模型生成-理解耦合漏洞的多轮越狱攻击框架，通过时空叙事隐藏恶意事件，在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型存在生成-理解耦合的漏洞，攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后利用理解功能在单次传递中吸收这些信息，形成跨模态生成注入攻击。

Method: STaR-Attack定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件，使用三幕叙事理论生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮。前两轮利用生成能力制作场景图像，随后引入基于图像的问答游戏，将恶意问题嵌入良性候选中。

Result: 实验表明STaR-Attack在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了统一多模态模型中关键但未充分开发的漏洞，强调了在统一多模态模型中加强安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

Motivation: 当前医疗AI模型基于群体平均优化，导致罕见但临床重要的病例被边缘化，这与精准医疗理念相冲突。

Method: 提出罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差等指标，定义基于流行度的稀有度效用，以及临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级。

Result: 在肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科等领域的临床案例显示，现有方法会错过罕见响应者、延迟识别非典型急症，并在威胁视力的变异上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医疗AI必须能够检测异常病例，权重选择应遵循结构化审议，以解决平均患者谬误问题。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了操作安全性的概念和OffTopicEval评估套件，发现当前LLM在操作安全性方面表现不佳，并提出了基于提示的引导方法来显著改善模型拒绝无关查询的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业面临的核心问题是LLM代理是否能在特定用例中安全运行，即能否适当接受或拒绝用户查询，而现有研究主要关注通用危害而非操作安全性。

Method: 引入操作安全性概念，开发OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，测试了6个模型家族的20个开源LLM，并提出两种基于提示的引导方法：查询基础化(Q-ground)和系统提示基础化(P-ground)。

Result: 所有测试模型的操作安全性都很差，最强模型Qwen-3和Mistral分别只有77.77%和79.96%，其他模型表现更差。提示引导方法显著改善性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3提升41%，Qwen-3提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全性是核心模型对齐问题，需要紧急干预，基于提示的引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出良好前景，可提高LLM代理的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

TL;DR: SCUBA是一个评估Salesforce平台上计算机使用代理的基准测试，包含300个真实CRM工作流任务，测试企业软件UI导航、数据操作等关键能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为评估计算机使用代理在复杂企业软件环境中的表现，特别是Salesforce CRM工作流自动化，需要真实且具有挑战性的基准测试。

Method: 创建包含300个任务实例的基准测试，基于真实用户访谈，涵盖三个主要角色，在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标。

Result: 在零样本设置下，开源模型代理成功率低于5%，而闭源模型可达39%；在演示增强设置下，成功率可提升至50%，同时减少13%时间和16%成本。

Conclusion: SCUBA基准测试揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的潜力，有助于加速构建可靠的企业软件计算机使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种重新思考AI数据中心生命周期管理的框架，通过协调建设、硬件更新和运营三个阶段，将总拥有成本降低高达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展推动了对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，但高端GPU的高资本和运营成本使得AI数据中心的TCO成为云提供商的关键问题。传统数据中心生命周期管理无法适应AI模型的快速演进、资源需求增长和多样化硬件配置。

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期管理的三个阶段：建设、硬件更新和运营。分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并利用运营软件优化降低成本。提出一个整体生命周期管理框架，协调优化所有三个阶段的决策。

Result: 该系统相比传统方法将总拥有成本降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 通过重新思考整个生命周期管理，协调建设、硬件更新和运营阶段的决策，可以有效降低AI数据中心的TCO，为未来AI数据中心生命周期管理提供指导。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种2D感知且GPU高效的稀疏注意力机制，通过希尔伯特曲线重新排序图像token实现连续内存布局，在保持空间邻域的同时显著加速扩散变换器的注意力计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在实现二维空间局部性时往往导致内存访问不连续，难以平衡空间局部性和GPU效率的权衡。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重新排序图像token以实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨区块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA在生成1024×1024图像时实现2.3倍注意力加速，在2048×2048时达到4.17倍加速，同时图像质量与基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功解决了空间局部性与GPU效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表研究级物理推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理研究多个领域，包含71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务。当前最先进的大语言模型在独立检查点上表现初步潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上准确率很低（GPT-5仅4.0%），配备编码工具后提升至约10%。


<details>

Motivation: 评估大语言模型能否有效推理前沿物理研究中的复杂开放性问题，了解物理学家希望LLM协助哪些推理任务，弥合当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的差距。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含71个复合研究挑战（模拟入门级完整研究项目）和190个分解的检查点任务，由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究设计新问题，采用抗猜测且机器可验证的答案格式，通过定制化的自动化评分流程进行评估。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在独立检查点上显示初步潜力，但在完整研究挑战上表现不佳：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5），配备编码工具后提升至约10%。

Conclusion: 当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求存在巨大差距，CritPt提供了标准化评估基础，可指导开发科学基础的AI工具。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

TL;DR: 提出BRIDGE框架，通过两阶段方法解决强化学习在机器人等领域部署的挑战：先利用专家演示数据学习安全初始策略，再通过人类偏好反馈进行在线微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗领域部署的两个主要障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据密集的探索风险。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略；2）使用基于偏好的人类反馈进行在线微调。提出BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE相比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好强化学习获得更低的遗憾值。推导出遗憾边界随离线演示数量减少的理论结果。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线数据量对在线样本效率的明确关联。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习任务进度作为密集奖励信号的简单有效方法，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来指导强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人任务中设计密集奖励通常需要大量手动工作且缺乏可扩展性，而任务进度可以作为一种自然的密集奖励信号来量化动作推进任务完成的程度。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频等被动视频中提取进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来推导密集奖励，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个具有挑战性的Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习性能，在9/10的任务中实现了近乎完美的成功率，每个任务仅需20万次环境交互。

Conclusion: 该方法优于先前方法甚至人工设计的密集奖励，并且能够利用真实世界的人类视频进行预训练，展示了从多样化视频源获取丰富奖励信号的可扩展潜力。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 响应扩大AI系统评估范围的呼吁，增强度量透明度并促进异构证据的整合，包括代理性、商业、能效、社会技术和安全信号等。

Method: 使用分层有向图结构，每个节点通过用户定义的聚合方法总结其子节点，不同于传统产生单一值、向量、表面或类别的度量方法。

Result: 通过大规模测量实践展示了实际效用，并提供了开源Python代码，为复杂结构的测量提供了透明方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为更广泛和可解释的AI评估提供了原则性基础，通过操作化复杂结构的透明测量方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DeepONets需要固定传感器数量和位置，缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了实际应用。虽然VIDON等扩展放松了传感器约束，但仍无法处理不完整测量或固有随机性带来的不确定性。

Method: 集成集合变换器嵌入处理稀疏可变传感器位置，使用条件变分自编码器近似解算子的条件分布，通过最小化负ELBO提供不确定性估计。

Result: 在确定性和随机偏微分方程（包括Navier-Stokes方程）上的数值实验证明了该框架的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测准确性的同时提供了原则性的不确定性估计，解决了现有算子学习方法在传感器灵活性和不确定性量化方面的局限性。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经算子模型依赖全局混合机制（如谱卷积或注意力），这往往会过度平滑尖锐的局部动态并引入高计算成本。

Method: FINO使用可学习卷积核替代固定有限差分模板系数，通过显式可学习时间步进方案演化状态。核心局部算子块包含微分模板层、门控掩码和线性融合步骤，构建自适应导数类局部特征。

Result: 在六个基准测试和气候建模任务中，FINO相比最先进的算子学习基线实现了高达44%的误差降低和约2倍的加速。

Conclusion: 严格局部性与可学习时间步进的结合为神经PDE求解器提供了准确且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug

conformational space, which are often slow and overly complex. In this work, we
propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拼图求解方法主要关注视觉线索，但在具有侵蚀间隙的挑战性场景中缺乏语义指导。本文探索利用自然语言描述为拼图组装提供语义引导。

Method: 提出视觉-语言分层语义对齐（VLHSA）模块，通过多级语义匹配从局部标记到全局上下文对齐视觉块与文本描述。采用结合双视觉编码器和语言特征的多模态架构进行跨模态推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于最先进模型，实现了14.2个百分点的碎片精度提升。消融研究证实VLHSA模块对改进视觉仅方法的关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过整合多模态语义洞察，为拼图求解建立了新范式。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

Motivation: 现有基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销大、未能有效利用历史token上下文的问题，需要更高效的推理时优化方案

Method: 维护top-K logits滑动缓冲区，执行实时奇异值分解识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit间隙统计自适应重新缩放logits，仅在不确定性高时激活

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SLS持续优于现有基线方法，在数学、编程和科学推理任务中实现更优准确率

Conclusion: SLS通过谱和熵特性有效锐化输出分布同时保持上下文一致性，为LLM推理提供了高效优化方案

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

*Daksh Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Poly-GRACE框架，实现与同态加密兼容的图自监督学习，通过多项式友好的GCN编码器和对比损失函数，在隐私保护的同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法如GRACE与同态加密等隐私保护技术不兼容，因为它们依赖非多项式操作，限制了隐私保护图表示学习的应用。

Method: 设计了完全多项式友好的图卷积网络编码器和基于多项式的对比损失函数，使整个框架与同态加密技术兼容。

Result: 在Cora、CiteSeer和PubMed三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Poly-GRACE不仅支持隐私预训练，而且在CiteSeer上性能优于标准非隐私基线，在其他数据集上表现相当。

Conclusion: 该工作为实现实用且高性能的隐私保护图表示学习迈出了重要一步，解决了现有方法与隐私保护技术不兼容的问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

Motivation: 基于黎曼优化原理，将优化方法扩展到双曲流形上，特别适用于庞加莱球上的学习，同时也能在欧几里得和其他非欧几里得设置中提供优势，促进庞加莱嵌入的学习。

Method: 扩展了双曲随机梯度下降（Riemannian SGD的特化）到双曲Adam优化器，使用双曲时间离散化的朗之万动力学训练扩散模型。

Result: 在特定数据集上实现了更快的收敛速度，同时不牺牲生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法在训练早期阶段（当参数远离最优值时）能够加速收敛，为扩散模型等应用提供了有效的优化工具。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

*Zenghui Huang,Ting Shu,Zhonglei Wang,Yang Lu,Yan Yan,Wei Zhong,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSformer是一个针对暴雨预报的长尾学习模型，通过高分辨率分支增强暴雨事件的表示，显著提升了暴雨预报的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 暴雨预报对现代社会至关重要，但降水数据分布高度不平衡（大部分无雨或小雨，暴雨事件稀少），这种不平衡阻碍了深度学习模型有效预测暴雨事件。

Method: 将降雨预报明确视为长尾学习问题，通过高分辨率分支丰富暴雨事件的表示，提出DPSformer模型。

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的暴雨事件，DPSformer将基线数值天气预报模型的CSI从0.012提升至0.067；对于前1%的暴雨事件，其FSS超过0.45，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为暴雨预测建立了一个有效的长尾范式，提供了增强预警系统和减轻极端天气事件社会影响的实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出STCast框架，通过空间对齐注意力机制自适应优化区域边界，利用时间混合专家模块动态分配月度预测，在区域天气预报、极端事件预测和集合预报等任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域天气预报方法受限于静态不精确的区域边界，导致泛化能力差。需要开发能够自适应优化边界并动态处理时间变化的AI框架。

Method: 使用空间对齐注意力机制(SAA)对齐全局和区域空间分布来初始化边界，基于注意力模式自适应优化边界；设计时间混合专家模块(TMoE)，通过离散高斯分布将不同月份的大气变量动态路由到专门专家。

Result: 在全局和区域预报、极端事件预测和集合预报四个任务上的实验结果表明，STCast始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: STCast框架通过自适应边界优化和动态时间分配，显著提升了区域天气预报的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEMs是一种基于Transformer的深度学习框架，用于处理具有灵活时间边界和多重执行约束的复杂执行问题，通过解耦市场信息处理和分配决策来优化执行路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统执行策略局限于固定时间范围，无法处理类似股票回购合约的灵活时间边界场景。需要一种能够适应不同执行目标和时间约束的统一框架。

Method: 采用解耦架构：通用特征提取管道（TKANs、VSNs、多头注意力）处理市场数据，独立分配网络处理特定执行逻辑。支持固定数量vs固定名义价值、买入vs卖出等不同场景。

Result: 在日内加密货币市场和多日股票交易（道琼斯成分股）上的实证评估显示，LEMs在灵活时间约束下动态优化执行路径，性能优于传统基准方法。

Conclusion: LEMs提供单一框架支持多种执行场景，相比资产特定方法具有显著操作优势，能够统一处理不同执行目标和时间约束。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN超参数优化通常需要大量试错或网格搜索，计算成本高昂。本研究旨在将传统用于质量工程的田口实验设计方法应用于CNN超参数优化，提供系统化的优化方案。

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列系统评估8个超参数：图像尺寸、颜色模式、激活函数、学习率、重缩放、洗牌、垂直翻转和水平翻转。开发了5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析，并采用对数缩放技术统一冲突指标。

Conclusion: 田口实验设计方法能有效优化CNN超参数，学习率是最关键参数。该方法为CNN超参数优化提供了系统化的指导框架，显著减少了计算成本。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备部署大预训练模型需要有效压缩，但设备能力异构，为每个量化配置单独微调计算成本过高。

Method: 使用配置感知模型将量化配置映射到低秩调整，通过帕累托优化配置搜索构建高质量训练配置集。

Result: CoA-LoRA无需额外时间成本，性能与需要单独微调每个配置的最先进方法相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA提供了一种高效适应异构量化配置的解决方案，显著降低了边缘设备部署大模型的计算负担。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列异常检测中，需要处理变量间复杂关系，传统方法可能破坏这些关系，影响检测效果。

Method: 基于变量间多重相关系数进行聚类，将变量划分为子集，确保变量间关系不受破坏，然后在每个子集上执行局部异常检测算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了异常检测性能。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法通过保持变量间关系的分区策略，有效提升了多变量时间序列异常检测的准确性。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Motivation: 研究双下降现象在简单模型中的表现，特别是在决策树和梯度提升等传统机器学习模型中，通过生物医学分类任务验证这一现象。

Method: 使用结核病异烟肼耐药性预测任务，系统性地在模型容量（如叶子节点数、提升轮数）和集成规模两个正交维度上变化模型复杂度。

Result: 只有当两个复杂度维度同时扩展时才会出现双下降现象；当任一维度固定时，泛化行为会回归到经典的U形或L形模式。

Conclusion: 模型复杂度应被视为多维构造，双下降现象源于不同泛化机制在单一复杂度轴上的投影，这强调了在分析泛化行为时考虑多维复杂性的重要性。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

Conclusion: PageANN通过创新的页面节点图结构和优化的内存管理策略，有效解决了磁盘ANNS的可扩展性问题，为大规模向量搜索提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Result: 在高树宽PGM的挑战性MPE查询上，学习到的启发式显著减少搜索空间，同时保持或优于最先进方法的解质量

Conclusion: L2C为MPE推理提供了有效的学习驱动加速框架，展示了数据驱动方法在难解推理问题中的潜力

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明，更大的分类器池可以提高分类精度，但会增加TinyML设备的平均推理时间。

Conclusion: 动态集成选择方法在TinyML系统中可以有效调整分类精度与推理性能的平衡。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

TL;DR: 提出了残差线性注意力（RLA）框架，通过显式残差拟合机制增强线性注意力的表达能力，解决了现有线性注意力变体在捕捉长程模式方面的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然提供线性时间复杂度的替代方案，但在捕捉长程模式方面存在困难。现有变体通常只能进行历史预测和单令牌修正，形成了表达能力瓶颈。

Method: 引入残差线性注意力（RLA）框架，维护辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并修正基础预测。具体实例化了残差Delta网络（RDN），包含自适应门控和残差裁剪以增强修正控制和稳定性。

Result: 在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA和RDN始终优于各自基线和现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距，同时保持线性扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过显式残差拟合机制，RLA框架有效提升了线性注意力的表达能力，在保持线性时间复杂度的同时显著改善了长程模式捕捉能力。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

TL;DR: AMLA是针对华为昇腾NPU优化的高性能内核，通过创新算法和预加载流水线策略，显著提升MLA在解码阶段的性能，达到614 TFLOPS和86.8%的理论峰值利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头部潜在注意力(MLA)虽然减少了KVCache内存使用，但带来了显著的计算开销和中间变量扩展，对硬件实现特别是解码阶段提出了挑战。

Method: 1) 基于FlashAttention的新算法，用整数加法替代浮点乘法进行输出块重缩放；2) 具有分层分块的预加载流水线策略，最大化FLOPS利用率。

Result: 在昇腾910 NPU上，AMLA达到614 TFLOPS，达到理论最大FLOPS的86.8%，优于开源FlashMLA实现的66.7%利用率。

Conclusion: AMLA内核已集成到华为CANN中，即将发布，为MLA在昇腾NPU上的高效实现提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出MSCoD框架，通过多尺度信息瓶颈和协作注意力机制解决蛋白质-配体相互作用建模中的层次结构和不对称性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构药物设计方法难以捕捉蛋白质-配体相互作用的多尺度复杂性和内在不对称性，限制了分子设计的准确性。

Method: 开发了多尺度信息瓶颈(MSIB)进行分层特征提取，以及多头协作注意力(MHCA)机制处理蛋白质和配体之间的维度差异。

Result: 在基准数据集上优于现有最先进方法，在KRAS G12D等挑战性靶点上的案例研究验证了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: MSCoD通过有效建模多尺度相互作用，为结构药物设计提供了更准确的生成框架。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯优化的多元变分模态分解-长短期记忆网络(MVMD-LSTM)框架，用于集成风-光-波海洋能源系统的超短期功率预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测方法多为单能源建模，未能充分考虑多能源间的复杂耦合关系，难以捕捉系统的非线性和非平稳动态特性，且依赖大量人工参数调优，限制了预测性能和实用性

Method: 首先应用MVMD联合分解风、光、波功率序列以保持跨源耦合；使用贝叶斯优化自动搜索MVMD过程中的模态数量和惩罚参数以获得本征模态函数；最后用LSTM对得到的IMF进行建模，实现集成系统的超短期功率预测

Result: 基于中国某海上集成能源平台现场测量数据的实验表明，该框架在MAPE、RMSE和MAE指标上显著优于基准模型

Conclusion: 该方法展示了优越的预测精度、鲁棒性和自动化程度

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

Motivation: 旨在开发一种理论严谨且实用的可逆归一化流方法，连接随机投影理论与归一化流，提供即插即用的高效解决方案。

Method: 使用通过高斯矩阵QR分解从Haar分布正交系综中抽取的随机半正交矩阵，将数据投影到低维潜在空间用于基分布，并获得黎曼体积修正项的闭式表达式。

Result: RPFs在理论上有坚实基础，在实践中有效，为生成建模提供了强大的基准方法。

Conclusion: 随机投影流是连接随机投影理论与归一化流的有力桥梁，提供了理论严谨且实用的可逆归一化流框架。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Motivation: 传统流匹配方法依赖直线条件路径，而学习测地线的流匹配方法使用RBF核或最近邻图，这些方法在高维空间中面临维度灾难问题。需要一种能忠实捕捉底层数据几何结构的更准确流方法。

Method: 使用分数匹配和退火能量蒸馏来学习度量张量，该度量张量能准确捕捉数据流形的基础几何结构，从而为流提供更准确的几何信息。

Conclusion: 通过学习度量张量来捕捉数据几何结构，可以有效改进流匹配方法，避免高维空间中的维度灾难问题，为时间数据提供更好的归纳偏置。

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法在时域或频域单独建模，无法充分利用多域信息，且传统注意力机制容易过度关注无关历史信息，引入噪声导致预测偏差。

Method: 使用小波变换对时间序列进行多分辨率分析，结合时频域联合表示优势提取关键信息；在倒置维度上应用注意力机制捕获多变量关系；引入差分注意力机制，通过两个独立softmax注意力矩阵的差异计算注意力分数。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的真实世界数据集上取得了最先进的(SOTA)结果，证明了模型的准确性和有效性。

Conclusion: WDformer通过小波变换和差分注意力机制，有效解决了时间序列预测中的多域信息利用和噪声抑制问题，展现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种无需梯度、计算高效的采样方法，能够从复杂的非归一化目标分布中生成忠实样本，克服传统采样方法在复杂分布上的局限性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 初始化高斯组件并从混合提案分布采样；2) 通过基于样本的KL散度目标优化组件权重或均值和方差，然后进行分层重采样。使用投影梯度下降、镜像下降和EM等优化方法。

Result: 该方法在各种密度函数上表现出良好的准确性和速度，优化-重采样方案在温和条件下产生一致的近似结果。

Conclusion: GMA采样器提供了一种梯度无关、计算高效的采样框架，能够有效处理复杂的非归一化目标分布，在多样化的密度函数上均表现出色。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Motivation: 联邦学习在车联网等动态异构环境中面临数据异构性和设备异构性的挑战，需要提升模型精度并优化资源利用。

Method: 引入校准损失作为效用指标进行参与者选择，并采用反馈控制机制动态调整客户端采样频率。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，FedCLF相比FedAvg、Newt和Oort基线模型，在高数据异构场景下性能提升达16%，同时通过降低采样频率提高了效率。

Conclusion: FedCLF能有效应对联邦学习在车联网中的异构数据挑战，显著提升模型性能和资源利用效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理训练只优化成功轨迹，无法处理现实部署中常见的工具故障（如超时、API异常、输出不一致），导致级联推理错误和任务放弃。

Method: 在增强的ToolBench数据集上构建50,000+恢复标注轨迹，通过系统故障注入和专家演示训练，使用LoRA微调保留基础能力同时注入恢复能力。推理时检测错误并检索55+故障示例库中的相似案例执行恢复动作。

Result: 在PaladinEval和ToolReflectEval评估中，恢复率从32.76%提升至89.68%（相对提升57%），优于最强基线CRITIC（76.34%）13.3%。对未见工具API保持95.2%的恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建容错代理的有效方法，能够在真实工具环境中实现稳健恢复。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

Conclusion: 低秩微调策略有潜力弥合通用大语言模型与领域特定应用之间的差距，为将LLMs适应专业领域提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法（如投影均方损失或CKA）无法有效捕捉教师模型的特征空间结构，即使损失为零时也存在问题。

Result: 在BERT和OPT语言模型家族的分类和指令跟随任务中，蒸馏性能提升了高达2个百分点，具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将特征几何整合到现有蒸馏方法中具有巨大潜力，新方法能更好地捕捉教师模型的特征结构。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有气象时间序列预测基准主要评估具有强周期性的变量（如温度、湿度），无法反映模型在降雨临近预报等复杂实际场景中的能力。

Method: 构建包含5年气象观测数据的RainfallBench数据集，设计专门的评估策略，并提出了BFPF（Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster）模块来增强降雨时间序列预测。

Result: 在RainfallBench上评估了20多个最先进模型，统计分析和消融研究验证了数据集的全面性和方法的优越性。

Conclusion: RainfallBench填补了降雨临近预报基准的空白，BFPF模块有效解决了零膨胀和时间衰减问题，为复杂气象场景的预测提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有静态提示策略（如零样本、少样本、思维链）存在效率与准确性的刚性权衡，准确策略在简单任务上浪费计算资源，轻量级方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 使用PPO算法训练Prompt Policy Network，通过资源显式奖励函数学习在必要时才分配昂贵推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确性帕累托前沿上表现优异，相比Self-Consistency减少61.5%的token成本，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: PPN为成本高效的LLM部署提供了系统化自适应框架，推动了轻量级优化技术的发展，促进可扩展和可持续的语言模型应用。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态间的完整协同信息，而协同信息是多模态表示的核心价值所在。

Method: 使用无限掩码策略，在融合时随机遮蔽大部分模态特征，仅保留部分信息以创建具有不同协同模式的表示，并通过互信息最大化对齐掩码前后的表示。

Result: 在受控实验中证明能有效增强模态间协同信息，在七个大规模真实数据集基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功提取和增强多模态协同信息，在多模态表示学习中表现出色。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个新颖的多模态学习框架，解决了现有方法依赖单一主模态、成对建模和完整模态观察的局限性，通过动态模态交互、符号化标记和稀疏专家混合机制，在完整和部分观察下都实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界多模态时间序列中的关键挑战：主模态先验不明确、模态数量多导致成对建模不实用、传感器故障导致任意缺失观察。

Method: 使用动态模态内和跨模态交互、符号化标记和自适应注意力预算构建长多模态序列，通过稀疏跨模态注意力和稀疏专家混合机制处理不同模态组合。

Result: 在四个数据集上评估，相比最佳多模态和多变量方法分别平均提升4%和8%，在40%模态缺失情况下平均提升9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中展现出鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel
conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three
heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL
frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for
future HetNets.

Motivation: 解决无监督学习中聚类算法选择的难题，减少对手工元特征和传统聚类有效性指标的依赖。

Method: 构建包含34,000个合成数据集的综合数据仓库，使用10种流行聚类算法处理，通过调整兰德指数(ARI)建立真实标签。网络架构整合卷积、残差和注意力机制，捕捉数据的局部和全局结构模式。

Conclusion: ClustRecNet通过深度学习实现了有效的聚类算法自动推荐，显著优于传统方法和现有AutoML方法。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

Motivation: 虽然预训练阶段的大语言模型扩展规律已被广泛研究，但RL后训练阶段的扩展行为仍未被充分探索，特别是在数学推理领域。

Method: 基于54个实验，系统分析模型规模、数据量和计算预算在RL后训练中的相互作用，重点关注数学推理任务。

Result: 发现四个关键规律：大模型在固定计算预算下表现更优；大模型样本效率更高；数据受限时重复利用高质量数据有效；这些规律在不同类型模型中保持稳健。

Conclusion: 为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

TL;DR: LEO-CVAE是一种生成式过采样方法，通过局部熵引导的不确定性感知机制，在非线性生物医学数据中改善类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过采样方法（如SMOTE）基于局部线性插值，在非线性流形数据中生成不合理的合成样本；而标准生成模型（如CVAE）忽视了边界区域样本的重要性。

Method: 提出局部熵引导的CVAE框架，通过计算样本邻域的香农熵量化不确定性，并使用局部熵加权损失和熵引导采样策略来强调不确定区域的学习和生成。

Result: 在临床基因组数据集（ADNI和TCGA肺癌）上的实验表明，LEO-CVAE持续提升分类器性能，优于传统过采样方法和生成基线模型。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的生成式过采样对于复杂非线性结构领域（如组学数据）中的不平衡学习具有重要价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Motivation: 探索梯度下降在矩阵分解中的动态行为，特别是在大步长情况下参数空间的分形特性，以及临界步长对收敛性和初始化敏感性的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析推导标量-向量分解的临界步长，研究正则化对敏感性的影响，并将分析扩展到具有正交初始化的通用矩阵分解。

Result: 发现临界步长附近存在混沌区域，梯度下降的长期动态不可预测，且没有简单的隐式偏置（如平衡性、最小范数或平坦性）。

Conclusion: 大步长梯度下降在矩阵分解中会产生分形结构和混沌动态，这对理解深度学习优化算法的行为具有重要意义。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

Conclusion: TREC为理解训练动态提供了新视角，能够指导数据课程设计，通过预测和优化数据放置位置来提升模型训练效率。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Method: 结合微网络基础层用于功能数据表示和基于梯度的插补模块，FCRN同时学习插补缺失值和预测事件特定风险。

Result: 在多个模拟数据集和真实世界ICU案例研究中，FCRN在预测准确性方面相比随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更有效地捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时适应不规则和不完整数据，推进了重症监护中的预后建模。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过变分自编码器混合高斯模型分析GW150914引力波数据，发现尽管模型能准确重构信号，但潜在空间存在统计不匹配，表明强去噪性能不一定代表潜在表示可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成模型在潜在空间中是否真正捕捉到数据的底层结构，特别是在引力波数据分析这种高维复杂数据场景下。

Method: 使用混合高斯先验的变分自编码器训练引力波数据，通过哈密顿蒙特卡洛采样获取后验样本，并与编码器在噪声数据上的输出进行统计比较。

Result: 模型能准确重构信号，但潜在空间存在明显的统计不匹配，表明编码器输出与真实后验分布不一致。

Conclusion: 强去噪性能不一定意味着潜在表示可靠，评估生成模型时应使用基于后验的验证方法。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

TL;DR: mixsemble是一种集成方法，将Dawid-Skene模型应用于多个基于模型的聚类算法预测的聚合，将聚类输出视为噪声标注进行建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实数据结构未知的情况下，需要一种能够稳健地整合多个聚类算法结果的方法，避免单一算法的性能波动，特别为非专家用户提供实用选择。

Method: 基于Dawid-Skene模型框架，将多个聚类算法的输出建模为噪声标注，通过集成方法聚合这些预测结果。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，mixsemble虽然不总是表现最佳，但始终接近最佳结果且避免较差表现，展现出良好的稳健性。

Conclusion: mixsemble在真实数据结构未知时是一个实用的替代方案，其稳健性使其特别适合非专家用户使用。

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多任务学习框架的贝叶斯相关向量机方法，用于在多个数据集上同时识别方程参数，以解决方程发现中的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方程发现面临的主要挑战是确保识别出的模型能够在不同操作条件下泛化，而不仅仅对特定数据集过拟合。特别是在结构健康监测中，不同载荷条件可能揭示系统物理的不同方面。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架下的贝叶斯相关向量机，将同一结构在不同激励水平下的响应视为相关任务，这些任务共享模型参数但保留任务特定的噪声特性。

Result: 标准单任务RVM模型能够重现系统响应，但在激励不足以激发非线性动力学时往往无法恢复真实控制项。相比之下，MTL-RVM通过跨任务组合信息，显著改善了弱激励和中等激励数据集下的参数恢复性能，同时在强激励下保持良好表现。

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推断能够缓解方程发现中的过拟合问题并促进泛化能力，特别适用于结构健康监测等需要处理变化载荷条件的应用场景。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashOmni是一个统一的稀疏注意力引擎，兼容任意DiT架构，通过灵活稀疏符号标准化各种稀疏策略表示，在单个注意力内核中执行多样化稀疏计算，实现高效加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器(DiTs)在视觉合成中表现出色，但部署受到高计算需求的限制。现有的稀疏加速方法需要定制化内核，限制了通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一稀疏注意力引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMMs消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性的加速比(1:1)，在GEMM-O中实现2.5-3.8倍加速，达到理论极限的87.5%。应用多粒度稀疏策略使Hunyuan模型(33K)实现约1.5倍端到端加速且不降低视觉质量。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用高效的稀疏加速解决方案，显著提升DiT模型的推理效率，同时保持视觉质量。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA方法，通过不对称的多LoRA设计，在多个任务微调中共享B矩阵，在联邦学习中跨客户端共享B矩阵，实现了更平衡的任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA扩展中A矩阵高度相似的现象，发现这种相似性主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和传输中扮演更关键的角色。

Method: 提出ALoRA：在多任务微调中使用多个A矩阵和单个共享B矩阵的不对称多LoRA设计；Fed-ALoRA：在联邦微调中通过新颖的矩阵分解策略跨客户端共享B矩阵，适应异构客户端的不同秩。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有的多LoRA方法，我们的方法在保持相当或更优的平均准确率的同时，实现了更平衡的任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过不对称的LoRA设计和跨客户端共享B矩阵，我们的方法在多任务和联邦学习场景中都能实现更平衡和优越的性能。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了HIA（高影响力攻击）框架，这是一种针对时序图神经网络（TGNNs）的黑盒攻击方法，通过识别结构重要性和动态重要性节点，结合边注入和删除策略，显著降低TGNNs在链接预测任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对时空动态图（STDGs）的攻击方法通常依赖简单、易检测的扰动，未能战略性地针对最具影响力的节点和边以实现最大影响。TGNNs在对抗利用时间维度的复杂攻击方面的鲁棒性仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: HIA利用数据驱动的代理模型识别结构重要节点（网络连接中心）和动态重要节点（图时序演化的关键节点），采用混合扰动策略，结合战略性边注入（创建误导性连接）和目标边删除（破坏关键路径），最大化TGNN性能下降，同时最小化扰动数量以增强隐蔽性。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集和四个代表性TGNN架构（TGN、JODIE、DySAT、TGAT）上的综合实验表明，HIA显著降低了TGNN在链接预测任务中的准确率，在平均倒数排名（MRR）上实现了高达35.55%的下降，相比现有基线方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了当前STDG模型的基本脆弱性，并强调了开发同时考虑结构和时序动态的鲁棒防御机制的紧迫需求。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为polychromic objective的新目标函数，用于解决强化学习微调中策略多样性丧失的问题，通过改进PPO算法来保持和利用多样化的生成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLFT方法在微调预训练策略时容易导致策略多样性丧失，收敛到少数易被利用的输出，这阻碍了探索并限制了测试时计算扩展的效益。

Method: 1) 使用vine采样收集策略轨迹；2) 修改优势函数以反映新目标下的优势；基于PPO算法优化polychromic目标函数。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和Algorithmic Creativity上的实验表明，该方法提高了成功率，能解决更多环境配置，在大扰动下泛化更好，在pass@k实验中实现了更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: polychromic目标函数能有效保持策略多样性，提升探索能力和泛化性能，使策略能够维持和利用多样化的策略库。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告中预算节奏控制对实现广告活动目标至关重要，现有方法依赖临时参数调整，存在不稳定和低效问题

Method: 结合分桶迟滞和比例反馈的控制方法，提供了参数选择框架和分析，确保准确跟踪期望支出率

Result: 在真实拍卖实验中，相比基线方法，节奏误差降低13%，λ波动性降低54%

Conclusion: 通过将控制理论与广告系统结合，为预算节奏控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，对小预算活动特别有益

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控（LPM）的新方法，通过监控模型改进而非预测误差来指导探索，有效避免智能体被不可学习的随机噪声源（如noisy-TV）困住。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于内在奖励的探索方法在面对环境中的不可学习随机噪声源时容易被困住，而基于不确定性估计或分布相似性的方法虽然最终能逃脱，但样本效率低且计算成本高。受神经科学发现启发，人类在探索过程中会监控自己的进步。

Method: 采用双网络设计：一个误差模型预测动态模型在先前迭代中的预期预测误差，使用当前迭代与先前迭代模型误差的差异来指导探索。LPM奖励模型改进而非预测误差或新颖性。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的噪声环境中，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM在概念上简单但有效，标志着噪声鲁棒探索的范式转变，通过奖励可学习转换而非不可学习转换来提高探索效率。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号应用中的隐马尔可夫模型等概率符号模型存在计算密集、数据传输量大等问题，传统方法会放大这些缺点，需要有效的压缩方法来提升部署效率。

Method: 采用归一化量化感知的期望最大化过程进行概率模型训练，通过降低数据位宽实现压缩，同时最小化对模型性能的影响。

Result: 在大型语言模型的约束生成任务中，成功将4096个隐藏状态的HMM量化为8位无损失，最多3位可接受损失，权重压缩率达到99%。

Conclusion: Norm-Q方法相比传统量化方法实现了更高的压缩率和合理的分数损失，能够有效缓解内存和带宽压力，适合在定制硬件上部署。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法如自回归和掩码建模容易受到噪声和混淆变量的影响，需要一种在潜在空间进行自监督学习的方法。

Conclusion: TS-JEPA为基于联合嵌入的时间序列基础模型开发奠定了基础，展示了学习通用表示的潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了数据高效的多任务策略学习，在减少专家数据需求的同时保持高性能，并展示了良好的零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的信号时序逻辑推理方法缺乏对推断规则的正式置信保证，而传统的共形预测通常作为训练后包装器使用，无法改进模型学习。

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非一致性评分，在训练中直接嵌入平滑的CP层，使用新的损失函数同时优化推理准确性和CP预测集。

Result: 在基准时间序列任务上的实验表明，该方法减少了预测的不确定性（实现高覆盖率同时减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性（使用固定阈值时的误分类数减少）。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习的STL公式提供统计保证，在可靠性和可解释性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: P2Es成功地从PPG信号生成了临床有效的12导联ECG，为动态心血管监测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出Mole-PAIR方法，通过偏好优化提升分子基础模型在分布外数据上的可靠性，显著改善OOD检测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子基础模型在分布外样本上不可靠，存在化学幻觉问题，限制了在药物发现等高风险领域的应用

Method: 将OOD检测问题表述为对ID和OOD样本间OOD亲和度的偏好优化，通过成对学习目标实现，本质上优化AUROC指标

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集上，对现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力有显著提升，在尺寸、支架和检测分布偏移下AUROC分别提升45.8%、43.9%和24.3%

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR是一个简单、即插即用的模块，可灵活集成到现有基础模型中，通过低成本后训练提高OOD数据可靠性

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟和混合信号集成电路设计中的晶体管尺寸优化过程需要大量人工参与，现有机器学习方法存在迭代次数多、缺乏电路设计知识等问题。

Method: 使用提示工程和思维链推理，集成大语言模型与电路仿真器和自定义数据分析功能，通过迭代探索设计方向、评估性能和优化解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM基AI代理能够有效自动化晶体管尺寸优化过程，在先进技术节点展现出良好的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

Motivation: 机械取栓术的自主导航面临血管解剖复杂性和实时决策的挑战，现有强化学习方法在多患者血管结构和长视野任务中泛化能力不足

Method: 使用TD-MPC2模型基强化学习算法训练单一智能体，在10个真实患者血管结构中进行多任务血管内导航训练，并与SAC方法对比

Result: TD-MPC2在多任务学习中显著优于SAC，平均成功率65% vs 37%，路径比率明显改善，但手术时间增加

Conclusion: 世界模型在改善自主血管内导航方面具有潜力，为未来可泛化AI驱动机器人介入研究奠定基础

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半离散流匹配方法，通过解决半离散最优传输问题来改进流匹配训练，避免了批量最优传输的二次计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输流匹配在理论上很有前景，但在实践中由于Sinkhorn算法的高计算成本而难以广泛应用，特别是当批量大小增加时计算复杂度呈二次增长。

Method: 采用半离散最优传输公式，通过SGD估计对偶势向量，然后使用最大内积搜索将新采样的噪声向量与数据点匹配，消除了对批量大小的二次依赖。

Result: SD-FM在所有训练指标和推理预算约束下都优于标准流匹配和OT-FM，在多个数据集、无条件/条件生成以及使用均值流模型时均表现出色。

Conclusion: 半离散流匹配方法成功实现了最优传输流匹配的理论承诺，同时避免了其计算瓶颈，为流模型的训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种因果推理框架来训练LLM路由器，通过结合黄金标准和偏好数据来纠正偏好数据的偏差，提高路由准确性和成本-质量权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要大量人机交互的语言任务中，为每个查询部署单一"最佳"模型成本高昂。LLM路由器可以从候选池中选择最合适的模型，但训练高质量路由器面临可靠监督数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 将LLM路由器训练问题转化为因果推理框架，将响应评估机制视为治疗分配。基于这一新视角，开发了一个集成的因果路由器训练框架，纠正偏好数据偏差，处理两个数据源之间的不平衡。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能提供更准确的路由，并改善成本与质量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 通过因果推理框架整合黄金标准和偏好数据，可以有效纠正偏好数据偏差，提高LLM路由器的性能和效率。

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

Conclusion: 主动学习能有效防止生成式AI工作流浪费资源在无意义候选物上，显著提高高质量设计候选物的识别数量。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

Motivation: 联邦学习面临非独立同分布数据和对抗性客户端行为的鲁棒性挑战，现有基于Shapley值的方法计算开销过大，限制了可扩展性。

Method: FedIF通过轻量级梯度操作在客户端更新和公共验证集上计算归一化和平滑的影响分数，实现高效的影响估计。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST上的实验表明，FedIF在标签噪声、梯度噪声和对抗样本下达到或超过SV方法的鲁棒性，同时减少聚合开销达450倍。

Conclusion: FedIF为现实世界部署提供了一个实用、理论可靠且可扩展的联邦学习鲁棒聚合替代方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

TL;DR: 提出了首个在上下文强化学习(ICRL)框架下确保安全适应的方法，通过约束马尔可夫决策过程在无参数更新的适应过程中同时优化奖励和成本函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICRL能够在无参数更新的情况下适应分布外任务，但现有方法缺乏对安全约束的考虑，需要确保在适应过程中同时满足性能和安全要求。

Method: 在ICRL框架中引入约束马尔可夫决策过程，使智能体在无参数更新的适应过程中不仅最大化奖励，还最小化额外的成本函数，并能根据成本容忍度阈值主动调整行为策略。

Result: 智能体能够根据成本预算主动调整行为：成本预算较高时行为更激进，成本预算较低时行为更保守，实现了安全约束下的自适应。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了ICRL在安全约束下的自适应能力，为实际应用中需要平衡性能和安全性的场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器(SAE)的许多特征只有在高激活强度下才可解释，希望通过二进制化消除连续激活变化带来的不可解释信息。

Method: 使用二进制稀疏自编码器(BAE)和二进制转码器(BTC)，将所有激活值约束为二进制(0或1)。

Result: 二进制化显著提高了发现特征的可解释性和单义性，但增加了重构误差和超高频不可解释特征的数量。频率调整后的可解释性评分显示连续稀疏编码器略优于二进制编码器。

Conclusion: 多义性可能是神经网络激活的固有属性，难以完全消除。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EMP的模型剪枝方法，该方法提供了一个通用的自适应阈值，可以应用于任何剪枝标准，通过保留N_eff个最高得分项来获得稀疏模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决剪枝中的一个基本问题：应该保留多少参数，提供一个不依赖于具体评分标准且无需调参的通用剪枝规则。

Method: EMP将任何评分向量s映射到一个内置的有效数量N_eff，保留N_eff个最高得分项，其余置零。N_eff受逆辛普森指数启发，利用单纯形几何推导保留质量的下界。

Result: 在MLPs、CNNs、Transformers/LLMs和KAN上的实验表明，使用EMP剪枝的稀疏模型性能与原始密集网络相当。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一个鲁棒的剪枝阈值（默认β=1），可以适应不同的剪枝标准和模型类型，同时β≠1时仍可作为可选调整来满足特定稀疏性要求。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

Conclusion: T-BiGAN展示了在不依赖人工标注故障数据的情况下进行实时广域监控的实用价值，为电网异常检测提供了有效的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层使用相同压缩比，忽略了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异，特别是中间层信息更丰富而首尾层更冗余的特性。

Method: 引入有效秩作为信息密度度量，通过拉格朗日乘子优化方案动态分配秩，对信息密度高的层组分配更多容量，并针对注意力层的重要性进行秩重平衡。

Result: 在多种LLM和压缩比下，D-Rank始终优于SVD-LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing方法，在LLaMA-3-8B上达到15+更低困惑度，在LLaMA-7B上获得5%更高零样本推理准确率。

Conclusion: D-Rank通过考虑层间异质性的动态秩分配，显著提升了SVD压缩LLM的性能，同时保持甚至提高吞吐量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

*Jason Stock,Troy Arcomano,Rao Kotamarthi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Swift是一个单步一致性模型，首次实现了基于CRPS目标的自回归微调概率流模型，无需多模型集成或参数扰动，在S2S天气预报中比最先进的扩散模型快39倍，且预测技能与基于数值的IFS ENS相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型为概率天气预报提供了物理基础框架，但其在推理时依赖缓慢的迭代求解器，使得在需要长预报时效和领域驱动校准的次季节到季节(S2S)应用中不实用。

Method: 引入Swift单步一致性模型，首次实现基于连续排名概率得分(CRPS)目标的自回归微调概率流模型，消除了多模型集成或参数扰动的需求。

Result: Swift生成的6小时预报具有技能性，可稳定运行长达75天，比最先进的扩散基线快39倍，同时达到与基于数值的IFS ENS相当的预报技能。

Conclusion: 这标志着从中期到季节尺度的高效可靠集合预报迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

*Kotaro Yoshida,Atsushi Nitanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预条件处理对特征学习和泛化性能的影响，发现预条件处理通过Gram矩阵引入可控的谱偏置，其与教师模型的谱对齐是提升泛化性能的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预条件处理在机器学习中广泛用于加速经验风险的收敛，但其对期望风险的影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究预条件处理如何影响特征学习和泛化性能。

Method: 将预条件处理实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，在单索引教师模型框架下，分析预条件处理如何通过Gram矩阵引入谱偏置，并从噪声鲁棒性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移三个角度研究特征学习。

Result: 研究发现学习到的特征表示紧密反映了预条件处理引入的谱偏置——偏好被强调的组件，对被抑制的组件敏感性降低。当这种谱偏置与教师模型的谱对齐时，泛化性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 预条件处理通过引入可控的谱偏置影响特征学习，其与教师模型的谱对齐是提升泛化性能的关键。指数p和教师与输入谱的对齐在泛化中起决定性作用。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分支定界与前激活分裂在确定性神经网络验证中表现优异，但需要扩展到概率验证场景

Method: 提出BaB-prob方法，通过分裂前激活将原问题划分为子问题，利用线性边界传播计算边界概率，引入不确定性水平概念和两种高效分裂策略

Result: 在未训练网络、MNIST和CIFAR-10模型以及VNN-COMP 2025基准测试中，该方法在中等至高维输入问题上始终优于最先进方法

Conclusion: BaB-prob为前馈-ReLU神经网络提供了可靠的概率验证框架，在复杂问题上表现出色

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

*Qihang Yao,Constantine Dovrolis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PWMPR是一种从稀疏到稠密的训练方法，通过增长网络而非剪枝来自动发现最优密度，相比传统方法成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏网络训练方法（迭代剪枝、动态稀疏训练、初始化剪枝）要么需要大量重训练成本，要么需要预先固定目标密度，存在效率问题。

Method: PWMPR从稀疏种子开始，基于路径核启发式分数添加边，通过随机化缓解瓶颈，并使用逻辑拟合规则检测准确率平台期来自动停止增长。

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验表明，PWMPR接近IMP彩票的性能（但密度更高），成本显著更低（约1.5倍稠密训练vs IMP的3-4倍）。

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是一个有前景的范式，与剪枝和动态稀疏方法形成互补。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

TL;DR: NuRL是一种新的强化学习方法，通过自生成提示来提升LLM推理的上限，解决了现有RL方法无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线强化学习方法如GRPO存在关键限制：无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习，导致模型的上限在RL训练后保持不变。这些困难样本无法产生训练信号，因为没有rollout能获得奖励。

Method: 提出NuRL方法，让模型自生成提示（包含解决问题的核心知识）。对于通过率为0%的困难样本，注入提示并重新生成轨迹批次，从而为之前无法解决的样本引入训练信号。

Result: 在6个基准测试和3个模型上实现了一致的改进，能够提升模型的上限，而GRPO则无法改变pass@1024。最佳提示是抽象且高层次的，在GRPO收敛后必要使用时效果最好。

Conclusion: NuRL通过自生成提示成功解锁了从困难样本中学习的能力，提升了LLM推理的上限，且与测试时缩放互补。

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MoE架构的路由机制忽略了模态间信息丰富且随时间变化的交互动态，这限制了专家专业化，因为模型无法显式利用内在模态关系进行有效推理。

Method: 提出多模态交互感知路由器，基于token的交互性质将其分配到专家；构建时间多模态交互动态的新公式化表示，用于指导专家路由；鼓励专家获得可泛化的交互处理技能而非仅学习任务特定特征。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试上进行全面实验验证，证明了方法的有效性，展示了增强的性能和改善的可解释性。

Conclusion: 时间多模态交互揭示了跨应用的有意义模式，可被用于改进基于MoE模型的设计和性能，提出的框架在性能和可解释性方面均有提升。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在训练过程中学习了大量决策规则，但在高维输入空间中这些规则难以识别和解释。需要找到既能保持模型决策又简洁可读的最小解释。

Method: 训练轻量级自编码器生成二进制掩码，训练目标整合多层激活对齐、输出标签一致性、稀疏性和紧凑性先验，以及确保忠实性的鲁棒性约束。同时引入电路读出程序，通过解释的前向传播和梯度识别活跃通道并构建通道级图。

Result: 生成的最小解释不仅保留了模型决策，而且简洁可读，同时通过电路读出程序实现了对模型内部计算的机制性理解。

Conclusion: 该方法在最小输入级解释和驱动模型决策的内部计算的机制性理解之间建立了实用的桥梁。

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

Motivation: 传统字典学习主要关注单个样本的稀疏表示，忽略了原子在样本间的共享模式，导致字典冗余和次优。需要一种能促进跨样本原子共享稀疏性的方法。

Method: 引入基于系数矩阵行向L∞范数的正则化项，从Beta-Bernoulli先验的概率模型推导，提供贝叶斯解释，并建立超参数选择的理论计算。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现重建质量显著提升（RMSE降低20%），表示稀疏性增强，仅使用不到十分之一的字典原子。

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进跨样本原子共享稀疏性，有效减少字典冗余，提升字典学习性能，理论分析得到实证验证。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain

methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed

certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Result: 实验结果表明，TSQA模型不仅能够成功使用伪标签进行训练，而且通过利用大量未标记数据，其性能超过了VLM本身。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TSQA任务中标注数据稀缺的问题，证明了使用VLM生成伪标签训练模型的可行性。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

Conclusion: 该方法能够处理其他方法难以应对的场景（如异类性数据），并且节点簇能够根据学习任务自适应调整，而不是仅依赖图连接性和特征。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

Motivation: 现有模型融合方法存在局限性：无训练方法依赖手动调参，有训练方法主要对齐参数而非下游任务行为，且通常忽略层间异质性。需要一种标签无关、参数高效且可扩展的融合方法。

Method: Expert Merging：使用无标签校准数据学习少量层间系数，通过隐藏状态和对数对齐优化，包含系数正则化和任务加权损失。Expert Merging++：增加重要性引导分块，基于学习系数、任务向量大小和参数数量计算层重要性，为高重要性层分配更多分块系数。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了UOT-RFM方法，通过不平衡最优运输和重加权策略解决长尾分布生成中的多数类偏差问题，无需类别标签信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配在长尾分布中会产生多数类偏差，导致少数类模式生成质量低且无法匹配真实类别比例。

Method: 使用小批量不平衡最优运输构建条件向量场，通过基于密度比的无标签多数分数进行逆重加权。

Conclusion: UOT-RFM能有效缓解多数类偏差，理论上一阶校正可恢复目标分布，高阶校正能进一步提升尾部类别生成质量。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声明验证方法忽视证据间的复杂交互，而基于全连接图的方法面临数据噪声和数据偏差两大挑战。

Method: MuPlon框架集成后门路径和前门路径的双因果干预策略：后门路径优化节点概率权重并加强相关证据连接；前门路径提取相关子图构建推理路径并应用反事实推理消除偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过双因果干预策略有效解决声明验证中的数据噪声和数据偏差问题，提升了验证结果的可靠性。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 现代无线系统不仅需要位置估计，还需要量化的不确定性来支持规划、控制和无线资源管理。

Method: 将定位建模为从接收器测量中推断未知发射器位置的后验推理问题，使用蒙特卡洛采样训练神经评分网络来比较真实和候选发射器位置。

Result: 在视距模拟中，MC-CLE学习了关键特性包括角度模糊和前向后天线模式，相比均匀基线和高斯后验实现了更低的交叉熵损失。

Conclusion: MC-CLE方法能够有效学习无线定位中的不确定性特性，在不确定性量化方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: Modern wireless systems require not only position estimates, but also

Candidate-Likelihood Estimation (MC-CLE), which trains a neural scoring network
using Monte Carlo sampling to compare true and candidate transmitter locations.
We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE

antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a
uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss

TL;DR: 提出了B2R框架，通过成本信号重新对齐实现非对称条件化，解决离线安全强化学习中对称令牌条件化导致的约束满足不可靠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于序列模型的方法对回报目标和成本目标使用对称输入令牌，忽略了它们内在的非对称性：回报目标是灵活的性能目标，而成本目标应是严格的安全边界。这种对称条件化导致约束满足不可靠，特别是在遇到分布外成本轨迹时。

Method: B2R框架将成本到目标重新定义为固定安全预算下的边界约束，统一所有可行轨迹的成本分布同时保留奖励结构。结合旋转位置嵌入，增强安全区域内的探索能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，B2R在38个安全关键任务中的35个满足安全约束，同时在奖励性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了对称令牌条件化的局限性，并为将序列模型应用于安全强化学习建立了新的理论和实践方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Conclusion: 证明了简单原则的有效性：通过聚合节点特征噪声与图结构特征，可以实现高效的图对比学习，无需复杂组件。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的普及，其安全漏洞日益受到关注。现有机器遗忘方法不仅依赖保留数据集来维持模型效用，而且在连续遗忘请求下会遭受累积性灾难性效用损失。

Method: RCU方法利用旋转显著性权重量化控制连续遗忘程度，设计斜对称损失构建认知旋转空间，通过旋转角度变化模拟连续遗忘过程，并使用正交旋转轴正则化最小化干扰。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需保留数据集即可达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续机器遗忘中的累积灾难性效用损失问题，为LLM安全提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPPO是一个新颖的轻量级PPO-based RLHF框架，通过流水线重叠执行提高训练效率，加速1.8-2.8倍，提升GPU利用率1.4-2.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PPO-based RLHF训练管道中的效率问题，包括顺序多模型依赖和长尾响应长度导致的训练瓶颈。

Method: 引入两种新技术：1）步骤内重叠，将上游模型输出流式分块，使下游模型能提前预填充；2）步骤间重叠，自适应地过度提交提示并推迟长生成，缓解尾部延迟。

Result: 评估显示OPPO加速PPO-based RLHF训练1.8-2.8倍，提高GPU利用率1.4-2.1倍，且不影响训练收敛。

Conclusion: OPPO是一个模型无关的高效RLHF框架，只需几行代码即可集成到现有PPO实现中，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的实体具有局部自主性，会覆盖预设的关联关系，这显著影响聚类结果（簇组成、几何结构和数量），进而影响后续推理和决策。

Method: 结合强化学习和确定性退火（DA）过程，DA在退火早期促进探索，后期转向利用。还提出了自适应距离估计网络（ADEN），这是一个基于transformer的注意力模型，学习实体与簇代表之间的依赖关系。

Result: 即使没有显式的自主性模型，该框架也能接近真实情况（差距约3-4%），而忽略自主性会导致更大差距（约35-40%）。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能够有效捕捉和适应实体自主性，显著提升聚类性能，在现实应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，智能体可以在在线学习过程中动态创建新动作，但动作生成通常需要成本。需要平衡生成成本与潜在收益，解决利用、探索和创建之间的三角权衡问题。

Method: 提出双重乐观算法，使用下置信界(LCB)进行动作选择，使用上置信界(UCB)进行动作生成，通过乐观策略平衡利用、探索和创建。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上的实证评估表明，该方法相比基线策略实现了更好的生成-质量权衡。理论分析证明算法达到了O(T^(d/(d+2))d^(d/(d+2)) + d√(TlogT))的最优遗憾界。

Conclusion: 该研究首次为具有扩展动作空间的在线学习提供了次线性遗憾界，提出的双重乐观算法能有效平衡动作生成成本与学习收益。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Conclusion: 后处理选择是因果发现中的重要挑战，通过明确建模这一过程，可以超越传统的等价类限制，更接近真实的因果结构。

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

Conclusion: CardioForest是一个高度可靠且可解释的WCT检测模型，能够提供准确预测和透明度，是帮助心脏病专家做出及时诊断的宝贵工具。

Abstract: This study aims to develop and evaluate an ensemble machine learning-based
framework for the automatic detection of Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia (WCT)
from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using
Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost
and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly
available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of
accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through
explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and
well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.

Motivation: 现有GRPO算法在组内所有响应获得相同奖励时会出现优势值消失问题，影响训练效果。

Method: 提出自适应采样（动态分配更多响应给困难提示）和响应重用（利用之前生成的正確响应提供训练信号）两种新技术。

Result: 在7B和8B模型上，AR3PO持续优于GRPO，与DAPO相当或更好，减少采样成本达4.2倍；在32B模型上，与DAPO性能相当但采样成本显著更低。

Conclusion: AR3PO是一种采样效率高的RLVR算法，能有效解决优势值消失问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RA3算法，通过中期训练发现紧凑的动作子空间，提升大语言模型在强化学习中的表现，在代码生成任务上取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在强化学习中表现优异，但充分发挥其潜力需要中期训练阶段来识别有用的紧凑动作集，并实现快速选择。

Method: 提出RA3算法，通过推导序列变分下界，使用强化学习迭代发现时间一致的潜在结构，然后在引导数据上进行微调。

Result: 在代码生成任务上，RA3相比基础模型和下一个token预测基线，在HumanEval和MBPP上分别提升8和4个百分点，在多个基准测试中实现更快收敛和更高渐近性能。

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑且有效视野较短时最有效，强调在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于完全异步去中心化多玩家多臂老虎机问题的算法，通过自适应探索和利用策略解决玩家碰撞和玩家数量检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统往往是去中心化和异步的，玩家可以随时进入或离开系统，且没有全局时钟。这带来了两个主要挑战：缺乏时间协调导致碰撞难以避免，以及玩家数量检测成本高昂。

Method: 开发了一种新颖算法，玩家在探索和利用之间自适应切换。探索阶段均匀拉动臂以减少碰撞概率，同时以较小概率继续拉动其他玩家正在利用的臂来检测玩家离开。

Result: 算法实现了$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$的遗憾界，其中$\Delta$是任意两个臂之间期望奖励的最小差距。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在异步去中心化环境中的高效MP-MAB算法，实验验证了其有效性和鲁棒性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Kairos是一个灵活的时间序列基础模型框架，通过动态分块标记化和实例自适应位置嵌入来解决时间序列信息密度不均的问题，在零样本基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列在不同时间段具有异质的信息密度，受系统状态和信号复杂度影响，而现有时间序列基础模型使用非自适应处理管道，无法捕捉这种动态特性。

Method: 提出Kairos框架，包含动态分块标记化器和实例自适应位置嵌入，能够根据每个时间序列实例的独特特征自适应选择标记化粒度和定制位置编码。

Result: 在包含3000亿时间点的大规模可预测性分层时间序列语料库上训练，并在GIFT-Eval和Time-Series-Library两个零样本基准测试中，以更少参数实现卓越性能，持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Kairos通过自适应处理策略有效解决了时间序列信息密度不均的挑战，为时间序列分析提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型往往过度依赖主导模态而无法达到最优性能，现有研究主要关注训练目标或优化过程，数据中心的解决方案仍待探索。

Method: 提出MIDAS数据增强策略：1）生成语义不一致的跨模态错位样本；2）使用单模态置信度进行标注；3）引入弱模态加权机制，动态增加最不自信模态的损失权重；4）提出难样本加权，优先处理语义模糊的错位样本。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准测试上的实验表明，MIDAS在解决模态不平衡问题上显著优于相关基线方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过数据中心的错位样本生成和双重加权机制，有效解决了多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法存在softmax平滑导致logit信息丢失的问题，而直接logit蒸馏又受限于logit平移不变性，限制了解决方案空间。

Method: 提出CSD方法，通过离散分数匹配对齐学生和教师模型在所有词汇对上的相对logit差异，解决了自回归LLM中训练不稳定和二次复杂度问题。

Result: 在GPT-2-1.5B、OpenLLaMA-7B和GEMMA-7B-IT上的实验表明，CSD持续超越现有KD方法，实现更好的保真度-多样性权衡，并与在线策略技术产生互补增益。

Conclusion: CSD方法具有可扩展性和有效性，为LLM知识蒸馏提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向模糊决策系统的空间感知可分性特征选择方法S²FS，通过整合标量距离和空间方向信息来联合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法要么未能直接将对准学习性能的评价标准，要么仅依赖非方向性欧氏距离来捕捉决策类间关系，限制了它们澄清决策边界的能力。实例的空间分布对决策边界的清晰度有潜在影响。

Method: 提出S²FS框架，采用空间感知可分性准则，结合标量距离和空间方向信息来全面表征类别结构。使用前向贪心策略迭代选择最具判别性的特征。

Result: 在10个真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，S²FS在分类准确率和聚类性能上均优于8种最先进的特征选择算法，特征可视化进一步证实了所选特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: S²FS通过空间感知可分性准则有效提升了模糊决策系统的特征选择性能，在保持高预测性能的同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于背包问题的最优探索预算分配方法，用于解决强化学习中LLM自我改进时均匀预算分配导致的梯度消失问题，显著提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在强化学习中的自我改进方法采用均匀的探索预算分配，导致简单任务始终成功、困难任务始终失败，两者在GRPO训练中都产生零梯度，影响学习效果。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出基于模型当前学习状态的自适应资源分配规则。

Result: 在GRPO中，该方法将非零策略梯度的有效比例提高了20-40%，可为特别困难的问题分配更大的预算（如93次rollout），在数学推理基准上平均提升2-4分，特定任务峰值提升9分。

Conclusion: 该方法作为计算"免费午餐"，能够将学习饱和任务的探索预算重新分配到最有影响力的任务上，相比传统均匀分配方法，达到相同性能只需约一半的计算资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Conclusion: 强化学习指导的数据选择方法具有很大潜力，能够在严格数据预算下实现高效的模型微调。

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

Conclusion: 迭代级探索为加强在线强化学习提供了实用有效的方法，并为替代目标的局限性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习采用差分隐私保护客户端数据，但添加的噪声会显著降低模型精度，需要解决隐私保护与模型效用之间的权衡问题。

Method: 将客户端模型分割为私有子模型（本地保留）和公共子模型（全局聚合），仅对公共子模型添加校准高斯噪声，结合随机客户端参与和本地数据子采样实现隐私放大。

Result: 理论分析显示MS-PAFL显著减少满足目标隐私保护水平所需的噪声量，实验验证该框架在强隐私保证下能训练高精度模型，实现优越的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: MS-PAFL通过模型分割和隐私放大技术有效解决了联邦学习中差分隐私导致的精度问题，在保持强隐私保护的同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于自主拉曼光谱分类的深度学习工作流，包含基线无关分类、池化控制鲁棒性、标签高效学习和恒定时间适应四个关键进展，能够在荧光基线、峰位移和标签稀缺等挑战下实现稳健分类。

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: 通过谱正则化可以提升平滑多数投票分类器的认证鲁棒性，同时提供了理论保证和实证支持。

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

TL;DR: CAST是一个完全连续可微的稀疏感知训练框架，用于半结构化稀疏模型，通过联合优化稀疏模式和权重，显著减少推理延迟和内存消耗。


<details>

Motivation: 稀疏感知训练可以将大语言模型转换为硬件友好的稀疏模式，但现有方法分别优化稀疏模式和权重，无法实现无缝联合优化。

Method: CAST包含三个关键组件：AdamS稀疏感知优化器、权重缩放模块和知识蒸馏，通过自适应L1衰减促进均匀稀疏化，同时保持稀疏模式。

Result: 在2:4稀疏模式下，从125M到13B参数的多模型家族上，CAST在困惑度和零样本准确率上显著优于现有方法。LLaMA2-7B稀疏模型仅用2%预训练token，困惑度仅增加0.09，零样本准确率提升0.36%。

Conclusion: CAST提供了一个高效且实用的稀疏训练框架，建立了准确的性能预测缩放定律，并在量化和微调场景中验证了稀疏模型的实际适用性。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Motivation: 现有非对称actor-critic方法通常假设训练期间可以访问完整状态，但在实际应用中这个假设往往不成立。本文挑战这一假设，探索如何在只有部分特权信息的情况下改进强化学习。

Method: 提出了informed asymmetric actor-critic框架，使critic能够基于任意特权信号进行条件化，而不需要完整状态访问。通过核方法和回报预测误差提出了信息性度量指标。

Conclusion: 挑战了完整状态访问的必要性，为非对称强化学习方法的设计开辟了新方向，这些方法既实用又理论可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Method: 首先分析注意力机制在噪声值特征下的行为，建立临界噪声阈值；然后将上下文错位建模为结构化噪声；最后提出间接注意力机制来间接推断相关性。

Conclusion: 间接注意力机制能够有效处理键值错位问题，在存在上下文错位的场景下优于标准注意力机制。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam更快，其成功机制源于对关联记忆参数（VO注意力权重和FFN）的优化，在重尾数据上能更有效地学习尾部类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM训练中表现优于Adam，但其成功机制尚不明确，本文旨在通过关联记忆视角揭示Muon的优势机制。

Method: 通过消融Transformer组件，识别关联记忆参数的作用；分析Muon在重尾数据上的优化特性；理论分析单层关联记忆模型在类别不平衡数据下的表现。

Result: 发现Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据上能更有效地优化尾部类别；理论证明Muon能实现跨类别的平衡学习，而Adam可能产生较大学习误差差异。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构一致，在重尾分布中比Adam能实现更平衡有效的尾部类别学习。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Motivation: 现有图分类后门攻击存在结构和语义异常，容易被异常检测模型发现，需要更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 使用基于异常感知判别器的对抗训练来学习符合分布的触发器，避免使用罕见子图触发器和标签翻转。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，DPSBA在有效性和可检测性之间达到了优越的平衡，攻击成功率高且隐蔽性强。

Conclusion: DPSBA框架通过抑制结构和语义异常，实现了更隐蔽的图分类后门攻击，为防御方法提供了新的挑战。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)框架，通过权重平均更新整个模型来解决时序域泛化问题，相比仅预测分类器层的方法具有更好的泛化能力和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序域泛化方法通常只预测分类器层权重，无法调整其他模型组件，限制了泛化能力；而预测完整模型权重计算成本过高。

Method: 1) 在保持参数相似性的前提下，通过在单个时序域上微调基础模型创建功能多样化的专家模型；2) 在主成分子空间中建模时序权重轨迹，基于专家与未来域的投影接近度自适应计算平均系数。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2种TDG设置下的实验表明，TEA比现有TDG方法性能提升高达69%，同时效率提升高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA框架通过权重平均有效平衡了泛化潜力和计算成本，在时序域泛化任务中取得了显著优势。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了PPO和GRPO中的裁剪机制会导致熵偏差：clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准裁剪参数下，clip-high效应占主导，导致即使提供纯随机奖励也会减少熵。通过使用更激进的clip-low值可以增加熵、促进探索，防止RLVR训练中的熵崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法在增强大语言模型推理能力方面表现出色，但容易发生熵崩溃，导致模型快速收敛到近乎确定性的形式，阻碍长期RL训练中的探索和进展。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究PPO和GRPO中裁剪机制对熵的影响，揭示clip-low和clip-high对熵的不同作用机制。

Result: 研究发现clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵，在标准参数下clip-high效应占主导导致整体熵减少。可以通过调整clip-low值来控制熵水平。

Conclusion: 裁剪机制是RLVR中被忽视的混杂因素，独立于奖励信号影响熵和推理行为。通过有意识地使用裁剪可以控制熵，防止熵崩溃，促进探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Conclusion: 概率嵌入框架通过建模序列级不确定性，提供了更准确和灵活的宏基因组分箱方法，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

TL;DR: 本文分析了超维计算(HDC)在不同工业应用中的性能表现，发现编码器类型、投影方差、维度等参数对性能的影响因应用领域而异。通过优化配置，HDC在保持高精度的同时实现了6倍推理加速和40倍训练能耗降低。


<details>

Motivation: 智能制造需要满足严格延迟和能耗要求的设备端智能。HDC作为一种轻量级替代方案，但现有研究假设HDC超参数与性能的关系在不同应用中稳定，这一假设需要验证。

Method: 分析两个代表性任务：CNC加工中的信号质量监控和LPBF中的图像缺陷检测。建立复杂度模型解释编码和相似度计算的趋势，并通过多目标约束优化HDC配置。

Result: 信号任务偏好非线性随机傅里叶特征编码，图像任务偏好线性随机投影。优化后的HDC模型在精度上匹配或超越最先进的深度学习模型，同时实现6倍推理加速和40倍训练能耗降低。

Conclusion: 领域感知的HDC编码是必要的，优化后的HDC为受限硬件上的实时工业AI提供了实用、可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Method: 提出对齐感知解码（AAD），在推理时通过隐式奖励优化来增强模型对齐，仅需标准的DPO设置，无需专门训练。

Result: AAD在多种对齐基准测试和模型规模上始终优于强基线方法，在数据受限情况下能产生高质量合成数据来改进标准解码下的对齐效果。

Conclusion: AAD提供了一种实用的解决方案，特别是在标记数据有限的情况下，能够有效提升模型对齐性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Method: 利用ROBOD数据集，比较了LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种深度学习架构在不同时间尺度上预测IEQ变量的性能。

Result: GRU在短期预测中表现最佳且计算开销较低，CNN-LSTM在长期预测中特征提取能力更强，LSTM在长时序建模方面稳健。预测可靠性受数据分辨率、传感器位置和人员流动影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为智能建筑管理系统实施预测性HVAC控制提供了可行见解，有助于在实际建筑运营中降低能耗并提升人员舒适度。

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

TL;DR: 提出Marginal Flow框架，通过参数化分布和可学习的隐参数分布来克服现有密度建模方法的局限性，实现高效训练和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密度建模方法存在训练昂贵、推理缓慢、似然近似、模式崩溃或双射映射等架构限制的问题。

Method: 定义模型q_θ(x)通过参数化分布q(x|w)和隐参数w，通过从可学习分布q_θ(w)中采样w来边缘化隐参数。

Result: 该模型允许精确密度评估，训练和推理速度比竞争模型快数个数量级，在合成数据集、基于模拟的推理、正定矩阵分布和图像流形学习等任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一个灵活框架，不受神经网络架构限制，能学习低维流形分布，可高效训练任何目标函数，并能轻松处理多模态目标。

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

Method: TFPI采用ThinkFree操作，通过在输入中直接附加</think>标记来显式丢弃思考内容，减少推理时的token使用。

Result: TFPI加速了RL收敛，达到了更高的性能上限，并产生了更token高效推理模型。4B模型在AIME24上达到89.0%准确率，在LiveCodeBench上达到65.5%，仅使用不到4K H20小时。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR适配方法，无需专门的奖励或复杂训练设计，就能显著提高性能并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控器对所有查询使用相同计算量，导致简单输入浪费资源或复杂输入检测不足。需要灵活的安全监控系统，计算成本随输入难度和可用资源动态调整。

Method: TPCs是线性探针的自然扩展，通过逐项训练和评估多项式实现渐进式计算。支持两种使用模式：安全拨盘（按需增强防护）和自适应级联（简单输入提前退出）。

Result: 在WildGuardMix和BeaverTails两个大规模安全数据集上，对4个参数高达300亿的模型测试表明，TPCs在相同规模下与MLP探针基线相当或更优，同时更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs提供了一种灵活高效的安全监控方法，能够在保证安全性的同时显著降低计算成本，为开发者和监管者提供可调节的安全防护。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发用于前沿模型评估科学的稳健统计程序建立了一个潜在途径。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

Result: ε-WDF在标准基准和分类器上提供了在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估，证明了可行性、一致性和有限样本认证保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为超越观测数据的群体公平性审计和认证提供了理论基础，确保在分布偏移下的可靠公平性评估。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了不同生成模型在物理系统仿真中的表现，发现随机插值法比基于高斯噪声的方法更有效，能够用更少的采样步骤产生更准确的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数生成模型依赖迭代去噪高斯噪声，这可能不是PDE和动力系统自回归预测任务的最有效选择。本文旨在评估不同生成模型在物理仿真中的表现，特别关注随机插值法的潜力。

Method: 使用随机插值法直接学习当前状态和未来状态之间的随机过程，利用连续物理分布的邻近性，与依赖传输高斯噪声的模型进行对比。

Result: 随机插值法可以使用更少的采样步骤，产生比依赖传输高斯噪声的模型更准确的预测。实验表明生成模型需要在确定性精度、谱一致性和概率校准之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 随机插值法为物理仿真建立了有竞争力的基准，并提供了对不同生成建模框架能力的见解，通过调整采样可以满足物理仿真的要求。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

TL;DR: NGT是一种轻量级模仿学习方法，通过将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题并使用对抗训练解决，在极低数据量（仅20个转换）下仍能在连续控制任务中取得良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低数据量模仿学习问题，传统方法依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构难以应用，需要数据效率更高的方法。

Method: 将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练解决，无需预训练或专用架构，内置不确定性估计。

Result: 在挑战性连续控制任务（包括高维Humanoid任务）上表现优异，在极低数据量下（仅20个转换）仍能取得良好性能。

Conclusion: NGT是一种简单高效、易于实现的模仿学习方法，在低数据量场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于自动调优优化算法超参数的新方法，通过统计评估、FAIR数据集和仿真模式，将超参数调优成本降低两个数量级，显著提升自动调优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动调优在科学计算中广泛应用，但优化算法的超参数几乎从未被调优，其潜在性能影响未被研究。

Method: 采用统计方法评估超参数性能，提供FAIR数据集和软件，引入仿真模式重放历史调优数据。

Result: 有限的超参数调优可使自动调优性能平均提升94.8%，使用元策略优化超参数可平均提升204.7%。

Conclusion: 超参数调优是推进自动调优研究和实践的有力技术，常被忽视但效果显著。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

TL;DR: 提出NeuroTTT方法，通过两阶段对齐策略解决EEG基础模型预训练目标与下游任务不匹配的问题，包括领域特定自监督微调和推理时测试时间训练，显著提升BCI任务的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模EEG基础模型在脑机接口应用中面临预训练目标与下游任务不对齐以及跨被试分布偏移的挑战，需要一种能够弥合通用预训练与特定EEG解码任务之间差距的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段对齐策略：1) NeuroTTT领域特定自监督微调，通过自监督目标将潜在表示与EEG的频谱、空间和时间特征对齐；2) 推理时测试时间训练，包括自监督测试时间训练和预测熵最小化，仅更新归一化统计量以适应新输入。

Result: 在三个不同的BCI任务（想象语音、压力检测、运动想象）上，使用CBraMod和LaBraM作为骨干网络，该方法显著提升了性能，达到了最先进的水平，优于传统的微调和适应方法。

Conclusion: NeuroTTT是首个将领域调优自监督与测试时间训练统一应用于大规模EEG基础模型的方法，有效解决了模型对齐问题，为通用脑机接口应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释性的解码策略AGD，通过引导生成过程关注用户定义的关键区域，显著提升LLM的指令遵循能力和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解码方法在满足复杂指令和生成事实准确文本方面存在不足，现有控制技术又常常降低输出质量，需要一种更有效的方法来增强LLM的可靠性。

Method: AGD从高概率输出候选token中选择对用户定义感兴趣区域(ROI)具有最高归因值的token，ROI可以灵活定义在模型输入或内部组件的不同部分。

Result: 在指令遵循方面，AGD显著提高了成功率（Llama 3.1从66.0%提升至79.1%）；在知识密集型任务中，减少了幻觉并提高了事实准确性；自适应变体还减轻了质量下降和计算开销。

Conclusion: AGD提供了一种多功能、更可解释且有效的方法来增强现代LLM的可靠性。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AC-RL方法，通过强化学习训练视觉模型生成更全面的图像描述，以支持数学推理系统，无需显式标注即可改善视觉-语言接口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型为人类读者生成的图像描述往往省略推理系统所需的关键细节，导致推理系统因缺乏视觉信息而失败，而非推理能力不足。

Method: 使用自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过训练过程中的澄清请求揭示信息缺口，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，促使模型生成更全面的初始描述。

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准测试中，AC-RL比预训练基线平均准确率提高4.4个百分点，如果允许澄清请求，可减少高达39%的澄清需求。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明仅通过交互就能有效学习视觉-语言接口，无需显式标注，澄清请求可作为隐式监督信号来改善模型性能。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Result: 建立了单问题多次尝试启发式优化的统一框架和分类体系，将分散在不同研究主题中的顺序替代选择策略进行了系统整合。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了单问题多尝试优化策略综述的空白，为实践者提供了系统化的策略选择和分类框架。

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

Method: 通过100多个受控实验（消耗50万GPU小时），全面分析MLLM构建流程，涵盖不同模型规模、数据类别和适应设置，并引入MLE-Bench评估基准。

Result: 发现推理先验主要来自推理中心数据（如代码、数学、学术文本），具有可转移性；感知先验则更分散地来自广泛语料库，对视觉编码器和视觉指令调优数据更敏感。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于数据中心的预训练方法，用于有意识地培养语言预训练中的视觉先验，为下一代多模态LLMs的发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法样本效率低，需要大量评估黑盒模型，成本高且不实用

Method: 结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化的自适应采样算法，优先选择信息量大的点

Result: ACE在评估效率上优于现有方法，同时保持识别最小可行变化的能力

Conclusion: ACE是样本高效的反事实解释算法，在保持准确性的同时显著减少模型评估次数

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始信息瓶颈（IB）原理在理解神经网络学习方面具有理论价值，但存在理论模糊性和准确估计的挑战，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 基于协同性（特征联合处理获得的信息）重新表述IB原理，使用基于平均交互信息的可计算协同性定义，构建GIB框架。

Result: GIB在各种架构（包括ReLU激活函数）中一致展现压缩阶段，在CNN和Transformer中产生可解释的动态，并与对抗鲁棒性理解更一致。

Conclusion: GIB框架在保持与现有IB理论兼容的同时解决了其局限性，为理解神经网络学习提供了更实用的理论工具。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

Motivation: Muon作为一种基于线性最小化预言(LMO)的新优化方法，在神经网络训练中比Adam等自适应方法更快。本文旨在探索如何将Muon有效应用于联邦学习环境。

Method: 提出FedMuon算法，解决直接使用Muon作为FedAvg本地优化器时的LMO偏差问题。分析了近似求解LMO对收敛速率的影响，发现FedMuon在任何牛顿-舒尔茨迭代次数下都能收敛。

Result: 实验表明FedMuon能够超越最先进的联邦学习方法。研究发现FedMuon在LMO求解更准确时收敛更快，且对任何数量的牛顿-舒尔茨迭代都能收敛。

Conclusion: FedMuon成功解决了Muon在联邦学习中的LMO偏差问题，在保证收敛的同时提升了训练效率，优于现有联邦学习方法。

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

Motivation: LLM在序列决策任务中虽然具有广泛先验知识，但针对特定任务时缺乏足够的任务相关数据，难以有效适应特定决策任务

Method: 构建记忆驱动框架，记忆存储历史交互和Q值，捕获决策相关知识，用于改进LLM先验；改进后的LLM生成更高奖励轨迹，进一步丰富记忆，形成自我改进循环

Conclusion: 记忆驱动框架有效结合LLM通用知识与领域经验，通过记忆与LLM先验的相互增强实现自我改进，在序列决策任务中表现出色

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

Conclusion: 这些贡献使分诊预测研究更具可复现性和可访问性，是临床AI中数据集民主化的一步。

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

*Kirill Tamogashev,Nikolay Malkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于建模薛定谔桥的通用方法，当其中一个或两个分布仅通过未归一化密度给出且无法获取数据样本时。该方法基于对迭代比例拟合（IPF）过程的泛化，并展示了在生成模型潜在空间中采样后验分布的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有薛定谔桥算法要求两个分布都有数据样本可用，但在许多实际场景中，分布只能通过未归一化密度函数给出，无法获取样本。这限制了薛定谔桥在科学计算和生成建模中的应用。

Method: 提出数据到能量IPF方法，将迭代比例拟合过程泛化到无数据情况，借鉴了离线强化学习中训练扩散采样器的技术。该方法学习动态系统的扩散系数，并假设固定的时间离散化方案。

Result: 在合成问题上验证了方法的有效性，能够成功学习多峰分布之间的传输。同时发现，通过学习动态系统的扩散系数，可以显著改进现有的数据到数据薛定谔桥算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为无数据情况下的薛定谔桥建模提供了首个通用解决方案，成功应用于生成模型潜在空间的后验采样，实现了无数据的图像到图像转换。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InVirtuoGen是一个用于小分子药物发现的离散流生成模型，支持从头生成、片段约束生成以及目标属性/先导化合物优化，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分子生成模型在训练损失和生成范式上存在局限，需要开发一种能够同时考虑所有序列位置预测、将生成范式从补全转变为精炼的模型。

Method: 采用离散流生成模型学习将均匀源分布转换为数据分布，结合遗传算法和近端属性优化微调策略进行属性优化。

Result: 在从头生成任务中实现了更好的质量-多样性平衡，在Practical Molecular Optimization基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在先导化合物优化中获得更高的对接分数。

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen为药物发现建立了一个多功能的生成基础，从早期命中发现到多目标先导化合物优化，并开源了预训练模型和代码。

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 梯度上升优化方法在机器遗忘任务中经常失败，原因是遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性，即使只是简单的相关性也会导致这些方法无法有效执行遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战普遍观点，揭示基于梯度上升的无约束优化方法在机器遗忘中的失败现象，关注遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性这一被忽视的因素。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，使用逻辑回归作为示例，展示梯度下降-上升迭代如何因数据集间依赖性而偏离理想重训练模型，并在复杂神经网络上进行实验验证。

Result: 研究发现梯度上升方法不仅无法达到理想重训练模型的效果，有时甚至会使模型比原始模型更差，导致遗忘过程产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性（即使是简单的相关性）足以导致基于梯度上升的遗忘方法失败，这一发现对机器遗忘的实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

*Guanxi Lu,Hao,Chen,Yuto Karashima,Zhican Wang,Daichi Fujiki,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdaBlock-dLLM，一种训练免费、即插即用的调度器，通过运行时自适应调整块大小来优化扩散式大语言模型的半自回归解码，解决了固定块大小方法的两个基本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的半自回归解码采用固定块大小存在两个基本问题：1）延迟解码开销 - 当前块外高置信度token的揭示被不必要延迟；2）过早解码错误 - 当前块内低置信度token过早提交导致错误。本文首次系统地质疑固定块大小假设。

Method: 通过分析去噪过程中的置信度动态，识别出波动带区域，该区域编码局部语义结构。基于此提出AdaBlock-dLLM调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小，使块边界与语义步骤对齐。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 除了推理时优化，本文希望语义感知的自适应调度方法和基于置信度的分析能够启发未来dLLMs的训练策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

*Vincent Grari,Tim Arni,Thibault Laugel,Sylvain Lamprier,James Zou,Marcin Detyniecki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACT将决策树方法扩展到非结构化文本数据，通过自然语言问题作为分裂点，结合TextGrad的LLM反馈来构建透明可解释的分类系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，AI系统需要产生透明、可解释和可审计的决策。传统决策树只适用于结构化数据，而LLM虽然能处理非结构化数据但缺乏可信赖的行为保证。

Method: 将决策树的分裂点表示为自然语言问题，通过基于不纯度的评估和TextGrad的LLM反馈来优化问题表述，构建可解释的决策路径。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT匹配或超越了基于提示的基线方法，同时产生了透明和可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT成功地将决策树的透明性优势扩展到非结构化文本数据，为高风险应用提供了可信赖的AI决策系统。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

*Xinyu Liu,Zixuan Xie,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩展Robbins-Siegmund定理，放宽零阶项的可和性要求为平方可和性，为强化学习中的Q-learning等算法提供收敛性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可和，但在许多重要强化学习应用中无法满足此条件，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 引入对随机过程增量的新颖温和假设，结合平方可和条件，证明几乎必然收敛到有界集。

Result: 获得了几乎必然收敛速率、高概率集中界和L^p收敛速率，首次为带线性函数逼近的Q-learning提供了这些收敛结果。

Conclusion: 扩展的Robbins-Siegmund定理为更广泛的随机逼近和强化学习算法提供了收敛性分析工具，具有重要理论价值。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测基准存在领域覆盖狭窄、忽视协变量任务、缺乏统计严谨性、评估基础设施不足等问题，需要更全面的基准来支持预训练模型的评估和持续进展。

Method: 构建包含100个预测任务的fev-bench基准，开发轻量级Python库fev支持可复现评估，采用基于置信区间的统计严谨聚合方法，从胜率和技能得分两个维度评估模型性能。

Result: 在fev-bench上报告了各种预训练模型、统计模型和基线模型的结果，识别了未来研究的有前景方向。

Conclusion: fev-bench解决了现有基准的局限性，为时间序列预测提供了更全面、统计严谨的评估框架，支持预训练模型的持续发展和有意义的性能比较。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ两种方法，将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量，保持前向传播的硬分配同时允许梯度流动，解决了向量量化中梯度阻断的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 向量量化在深度模型中很常见，但其硬分配会阻断梯度并阻碍端到端训练。

Method: DiVeQ将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量；SF-DiVeQ是空间填充变体，将分配扩展到码字连接构成的曲线上，减少量化误差并充分利用码本。两种方法都不需要辅助损失或温度调度。

Result: 在VQ-VAE压缩和VQGAN生成任务上，在多个数据集上相比其他量化方法提高了重建和样本质量。

Conclusion: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ能够实现端到端训练，无需复杂调度，在压缩和生成任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 等变神经网络在分子和几何数据学习中具有强归纳偏置，但通常依赖专门且计算昂贵的张量操作，需要提高效率。

Method: 开发局部规范化框架，将现有张量场网络转换到该范式，系统比较不同等变表示的理论复杂度、经验运行时间和预测准确性。

Result: 该框架在保持等变性的同时显著改善了运行时间，并提供了易于集成到标准消息传递神经网络中的实现。

Conclusion: 局部规范化范式为等变神经网络提供了高效替代方案，平衡了计算效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAT（Entropy After </Think>）的简单方法来检测和防止大型推理模型的过度思考问题，通过在推理过程中监控停止思考标记后的熵值变化，实现自适应计算分配，显著减少token使用量而不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在长链推理中表现更好，但存在过度思考的问题——即使已经得出正确答案仍继续修正，造成token浪费。需要一种方法来检测和防止这种低效行为。

Method: 提出EAT信号：在推理过程中添加停止思考标记(</think>)，监控后续token的熵值变化轨迹。当Pass@1达到平台期时，熵值会下降并稳定，通过指数移动平均的方差阈值化实现实用的停止规则。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT方法减少token使用量13-21%而不损害准确性。即使在无法访问推理模型logits的黑盒设置中，使用代理模型计算EAT仍然有效。

Conclusion: EAT提供了一种简单且廉价的方法来监控推理过程，实现自适应计算分配，比固定token预算更高效，能有效防止模型过度思考问题。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，通过客户端-服务器不匹配模型架构和知识蒸馏来解决异构联邦学习中的个性化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习生成的最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的需求，特别是在数据、任务和模态都异构的环境中，缺乏对基础模型进行微调和个性化的研究

Method: TAP采用两阶段方法：(i)利用客户端与服务器模型架构不匹配来选择性进行替换操作；(ii)在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，在不影响个性化的情况下捕获有益通用知识

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提算法在各种数据集和任务上的有效性，优于多个基线方法

Conclusion: TAP能够有效解决异构联邦学习中的个性化问题，特别是在多任务多模态环境下，通过两阶段自适应策略实现更好的个性化性能

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Conclusion: 该方法为电力系统提供了对抗不稳定性攻击的可行防御方案，具有成本效益和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

Motivation: 开发一种能够解释神经网络如何感知数据相似性的方法，帮助理解模型内部表示与语义层次结构的关系。

Method: 损失核方法：计算在低损失保持参数扰动分布下的每样本损失协方差矩阵，通过合成多任务问题验证，并应用于Inception-v1模型分析ImageNet数据结构。

Result: 在合成多任务问题上验证了方法能按任务分离输入；应用于ImageNet时，损失核结构与WordNet语义层次结构一致。

Conclusion: 损失核是一种实用的可解释性和数据归因工具，能够揭示神经网络对数据相似性的内部表示。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

TL;DR: TASP是一种针对长上下文LLM的拓扑感知序列并行方法，通过拓扑分解和原语分解充分利用现代加速器的通信能力，相比Ring Attention实现了高达3.58倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流序列并行方法Ring Attention由于采用Ring AllGather通信原语，与现代加速器的AlltoAll拓扑不匹配，导致通信效率低下，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 基于哈密顿分解理论，将现代加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环形数据路径，并将Ring AllGather原语分解为相同数量的并发环形数据传输，提出TASP方法。

Result: 在单节点和多节点NVIDIA H100系统以及单节点AMD MI300X系统上的实验表明，TASP比Ring Attention及其变体Zigzag-Ring Attention实现了更高的通信效率，最高可达3.58倍的加速。

Conclusion: TASP通过拓扑感知的序列并行方法有效解决了长上下文LLM中的通信效率问题，为大规模模型训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at

high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence
function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces
Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar

Motivation: 胸主动脉瘤由多种机械和机械生物学破坏引起，需要识别驱动疾病进展的相互作用因素。

Method: 使用有限元框架生成数百种异质性损伤的合成胸主动脉瘤，构建局部扩张和扩张性的空间图，训练神经网络预测初始损伤组合。

Result: 仅使用扩张度数据训练时预测误差显著更高，UNet在所有数据格式中始终提供最高精度。

Conclusion: 在胸主动脉瘤评估中获取扩张度和扩张性的全场测量对于揭示疾病的机械生物学驱动因素和开发个性化治疗策略至关重要。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)方法，将LLM推理视为导向正确答案的时序过程，通过条件概率规则捕捉推理步骤间的因果关系，解决现有过程奖励模型中的信用分配模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRMs)要么孤立处理推理步骤无法捕捉步骤间依赖，要么难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐，导致奖励信号不尊重时序因果关系，面临信用分配模糊问题，使下游模型易受奖励攻击且性能不佳。

Method: CRM将LLM推理建模为时序过程，每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与推理轨迹的最终结果相关联。通过强制执行条件概率规则，捕捉推理步骤间的因果关系，通过与结果的联系实现中间步骤的精确归因。

Result: 在Best-of-N采样、波束搜索和强化学习等实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型，对奖励攻击更鲁棒，在不依赖真实奖励的情况下提供稳定的下游改进。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了一个原则性框架，通过条件概率建模实现可靠的跨样本比较，解决了过程奖励模型中的关键限制。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

Motivation: 机器学习模型预测的不确定性量化对于安全关键应用中的可靠决策至关重要，但目前的不确定性量化理论主要关注分类问题，扩展到回归任务仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于CRPS、对数、平方误差和二次评分等适当评分规则，推导出实用参数假设下的闭式不确定性度量表达式，并使用模型集成进行估计。

Result: 该框架能够自然地将不确定性分解为偶然性和认知性分量，并恢复了基于预测方差和微分熵的流行回归不确定性度量方法。

Conclusion: 在合成和真实世界回归数据集上的广泛评估为选择可靠的不确定性度量提供了指导，该统一框架为回归不确定性量化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

TL;DR: 提出递归自聚合（RSA）方法，结合并行和顺序推理的优势，通过迭代聚合候选推理链来提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时计算扩展方法要么是并行选择多个独立解，要么是顺序自我优化，但都有局限性。需要结合两者的优势来更有效地利用推理计算资源。

Method: RSA通过递归聚合候选推理链的子集来改进解决方案群体，利用推理链中的丰富信息（不仅是最终答案），从不同思维链的部分正确步骤中自举。

Result: RSA在不同任务、模型家族和规模上都带来了显著的性能提升，使较小的模型（如Qwen3-4B）能够与更大的推理模型竞争，并在多个基准测试中优于纯并行和顺序扩展策略。

Conclusion: RSA是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，通过聚合感知的强化学习训练模型结合解决方案能带来显著的性能增益。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Motivation: 现有过程监督强化学习方法存在探索效率低的问题，包括分支位置选择和采样效率不足。观察到高注意力分数步骤与推理行为相关，因此希望通过注意力机制改进探索策略。

Method: 1) 基于高注意力值选择分支位置；2) 自适应采样策略考虑问题难度和历史批次大小；3) 设计一步离策略训练流程提升采样效率。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，该方法在性能、采样效率和训练效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AttnRL框架通过注意力指导的分支选择和自适应采样，有效解决了过程监督强化学习的探索效率问题，为推理模型的训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，需要能够严格评估模型在安全关键、动态现实环境中理解和推理能力的基准测试。

Method: 构建包含车辆事故和空中/水域安全关键场景的大规模数据集，涵盖不同视频长度和难度级别，系统性地测试时间、空间和意图理解推理能力。

Result: 对最先进模型（如Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-5）的评估显示，即使在最简单的任务上，最强模型也只能达到约18%的准确率，在真实世界的时空和意图推理方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: AccidentBench旨在揭示这些关键差距，推动开发更安全、更稳健、更符合现实世界安全挑战的多模态模型。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

Motivation: AI对数据扰动和对抗样本敏感，但传统鲁棒性评估需要访问训练和测试数据，可能危及数据隐私和机密性。需要一种方法允许外部验证AI而不泄露私有数据集。

Method: SPATA将每个数据实例投影到离散空间中进行分析和比较，生成统计模式的领域无关表示，避免数据泄露风险。

Result: 投影后的数据集可可靠地用于评估不同特征如何影响ML模型鲁棒性，并生成模型行为的可解释说明。

Conclusion: SPATA有助于提高处理机密数据或关键基础设施的组织的透明度，为更可信的AI做出贡献。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 随着AI技术进入高风险领域，系统评估变得至关重要。欧盟AI法案引入AI监管沙盒，但面临评估方法碎片化、测试缺乏标准化、开发者与监管者反馈循环薄弱等挑战。

Method: 开发模块化开源框架，允许用户从共享库中选择领域相关测试，生成定制化沙盒环境并集成仪表板。采用插件架构支持开放和专有模块，构建可互操作的AI评估服务生态系统。

Conclusion: 通过促进跨境合作和标准化，Sandbox Configurator旨在支持可扩展且创新友好的欧洲可信AI治理基础设施。

Abstract: The systematic assessment of AI systems is increasingly vital as these
technologies enter high-stakes domains. To address this, the EU's Artificial
Intelligence Act introduces AI Regulatory Sandboxes (AIRS): supervised
environments where AI systems can be tested under the oversight of Competent
Authorities (CAs), balancing innovation with compliance, particularly for
startups and SMEs. Yet significant challenges remain: assessment methods are
fragmented, tests lack standardisation, and feedback loops between developers
and regulators are weak. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Sandbox
Configurator, a modular open-source framework that enables users to select
domain-relevant tests from a shared library and generate customised sandbox
environments with integrated dashboards. Its plug-in architecture aims to
support both open and proprietary modules, fostering a shared ecosystem of
interoperable AI assessment services. The framework aims to address multiple
stakeholders: CAs gain structured workflows for applying legal obligations;
technical experts can integrate robust evaluation methods; and AI providers
access a transparent pathway to compliance. By promoting cross-border
collaboration and standardisation, the Sandbox Configurator's goal is to
support a scalable and innovation-friendly European infrastructure for
trustworthy AI governance.

Abstract: Practical lab education in computer science often faces challenges such as
plagiarism, lack of proper lab records, unstructured lab conduction, inadequate
execution and assessment, limited practical learning, low student engagement,
and absence of progress tracking for both students and faculties, resulting in
graduates with insufficient hands-on skills. In this paper, we introduce
AsseslyAI, which addresses these challenges through online lab allocation, a
unique lab problem for each student, AI-proctored viva evaluations, and
gamified simulators to enhance engagement and conceptual mastery. While
existing platforms generate questions based on topics, our framework fine-tunes
on a 10k+ question-answer dataset built from AI/ML lab questions to dynamically
generate diverse, code-rich assessments. Validation metrics show high
question-answer similarity, ensuring accurate answers and non-repetitive
questions. By unifying dataset-driven question generation, adaptive difficulty,
plagiarism resistance, and evaluation in a single pipeline, our framework
advances beyond traditional automated grading tools and offers a scalable path
to produce genuinely skilled graduates.

Method: 使用DeepSeek生成2943个虚拟参与者，匹配CFPS2018的人口分布，与人类在五大性格特质和主观幸福感上的反应进行比较。

Result: 模拟与真实数据在区域变化趋势上相似，但存在系统性差异：模拟参与者在外向性和开放性上得分较低，在宜人性和神经质上得分较高，幸福感持续较低。预测结构也不同。

Conclusion: LLMs能近似人口层面的心理分布，但低估了文化特定和情感维度，需要文化丰富的训练数据和改进的情感建模。

Abstract: This study examines whether LLMs can simulate culturally grounded
psychological patterns based on demographic information. Using DeepSeek, we
generated 2943 virtual participants matched to demographic distributions from
the CFPS2018 and compared them with human responses on the Big Five personality
traits and subjective well-being across seven Chinese regions.Personality was
measured using a 15-item Chinese Big Five inventory, and happiness with a
single-item rating. Results revealed broad similarity between real and
simulated datasets, particularly in regional variation trends. However,
systematic differences emerged:simulated participants scored lower in
extraversion and openness, higher in agreeableness and neuroticism, and
consistently reported lower happiness. Predictive structures also diverged:
while human data identified conscientiousness, extraversion and openness as
positive predictors of happiness, the AI emphasized openness and agreeableness,
with extraversion predicting negatively. These discrepancies suggest that while
LLMs can approximate population-level psychological distributions, they
underrepresent culturally specific and affective dimensions. The findings
highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based virtual participants
for large-scale psychological research and underscore the need for culturally
enriched training data and improved affective modeling.

Result: 发现模型之间存在高度变异性，且模型的政治倾向与其开发国家的政治文化有强烈关联。

Conclusion: 需要更详细地检查嵌入在AI系统中的社会政治维度。

Abstract: Political beliefs vary significantly across different countries, reflecting
distinct historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. These ideologies,
ranging from liberal democracies to rigid autocracies, influence human
societies, as well as the digital systems that are constructed within those
societies. The advent of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), introduces new agents in the political space-agents
trained on massive corpora that replicate and proliferate socio-political
assumptions. This paper analyses whether LLMs display propensities consistent
with democratic or autocratic world-views. We validate this insight through
experimental tests in which we experiment with the leading LLMs developed
across disparate political contexts, using several existing psychometric and
political orientation measures. The analysis is based on both numerical scoring
and qualitative analysis of the models' responses. Findings indicate high
model-to-model variability and a strong association with the political culture
of the country in which the model was developed. These findings highlight the
need for more detailed examination of the socio-political dimensions embedded
within AI systems.

*Hechuan Guo,Yongle Hao,Yue Zhang,Minghui Xu,Peizhuo Lyu,Jiezhi Chen,Xiuzhen Cheng*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 这是首个对MCP生态系统的大规模实证研究，通过MCPCrawler框架分析了6个主要市场的8,401个有效项目，揭示了超过一半的项目无效或低价值、服务器面临结构性风险、客户端协议模式处于过渡阶段等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP作为连接LLM与外部工具的统一标准，虽然快速被采用但发展轨迹不确定，需要实证研究来了解其市场增长、安全性和标准化程度。

Method: 设计并实现MCPCrawler系统化测量框架，在14天内从6个主要市场收集17,630个原始条目，分析其中8,401个有效项目（8,060个服务器和341个客户端）。

Result: 发现超过一半的上市项目无效或低价值；服务器面临依赖单一化和维护不均衡等结构性风险；客户端在协议和连接模式上处于过渡阶段。

Conclusion: 研究为MCP生态系统提供了首个基于证据的视图，揭示了其风险和未来发展趋势，表明该生态系统仍面临重大挑战。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been proposed as a unifying standard for
connecting large language models (LLMs) with external tools and resources,
promising the same role for AI integration that HTTP and USB played for the Web
and peripherals. Yet, despite rapid adoption and hype, its trajectory remains
uncertain. Are MCP marketplaces truly growing, or merely inflated by
placeholders and abandoned prototypes? Are servers secure and
privacy-preserving, or do they expose users to systemic risks? And do clients
converge on standardized protocols, or remain fragmented across competing
designs? In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of the
MCP ecosystem. We design and implement MCPCrawler, a systematic measurement
framework that collects and normalizes data from six major markets. Over a
14-day campaign, MCPCrawler aggregated 17,630 raw entries, of which 8,401 valid
projects (8,060 servers and 341 clients) were analyzed. Our results reveal that
more than half of listed projects are invalid or low-value, that servers face
structural risks including dependency monocultures and uneven maintenance, and
that clients exhibit a transitional phase in protocol and connection patterns.
Together, these findings provide the first evidence-based view of the MCP
ecosystem, its risks, and its future trajectory.

TL;DR: 该研究调查了巴基斯坦K-12学校中AI的采用情况、使用模式和感知影响，发现教师对AI持积极态度，但使用不均衡，内容生成是最常见的应用，而AI驱动的评分和反馈很少使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索发展中国家学校中AI的采用情况，特别是在巴基斯坦K-12学校中，了解AI的采用程度、使用模式和教师对AI影响的看法。

Method: 研究方法是通过对125名教育工作者进行问卷调查，涵盖教师对AI的熟悉程度、使用频率和模式，以及对AI益处和挑战的态度。

Result: 结果显示，超过三分之二的教师表示愿意在适当支持下采用AI工具，许多教师已开始将AI用于课程规划和内容创建。约三分之一的受访者经常使用AI工具，而其他教师则偶尔使用。内容生成是最常见的AI应用，而AI驱动的评分和反馈很少使用。

Conclusion: 结论是巴基斯坦学校对AI的潜力充满热情，但需要培训和基础设施以确保包容和有效的实施。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly permeating classrooms worldwide,
yet its adoption in schools of developing countries remains under-explored.
This paper investigates AI adoption, usage patterns, and perceived impact in
Pakistani K-12 schools based on a survey of 125 educators. The questionnaire
covered educator's familiarity with AI, frequency and modes of use, and
attitudes toward AI's benefits and challenges. Results reveal a generally
positive disposition towards AI: over two-thirds of teachers expressed
willingness to adopt AI tools given proper support and many have begun
integrating AI for lesson planning and content creation. However, AI usage is
uneven - while about one-third of respondents actively use AI tools frequently,
others remain occasional users. Content generation emerged as the most common
AI application, whereas AI-driven grading and feedback are rarely used.
Teachers reported moderate improvements in student engagement and efficiency
due to AI, but also voiced concerns about equitable access. These findings
highlight both the enthusiasm for AI's potential in Pakistan's schools and the
need for training and infrastructure to ensure inclusive and effective
implementation.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究分析了2000-2025年全球AI研究格局的转变，发现美国、欧盟相对份额大幅下降，而中国从不足5%增长到近36%，成为主导力量，印度也显著崛起。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨全球AI研究主导地位的动态变化，了解各国在AI研究领域的相对贡献变化趋势。

Method: 使用OpenAlex数据集，采用分数计数法避免合著工作的重复归属，分析主要国家AI出版物的相对份额。

Result: 美国+欧盟份额从57%降至25%以下，中国从5%升至36%，印度显著崛起，形成多极化的亚洲研究生态系统。

Conclusion: 全球AI研究格局发生深刻重构，中国成为主导力量，具有塑造AI创新和标准制定的战略能力，但研究存在质量评估的局限性。

Abstract: This study investigates the shifting global dynamics of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research by analysing the trajectories of countries
dominating AI publications between 2000 and 2025. Drawing on the comprehensive
OpenAlex dataset and employing fractional counting to avoid double attribution
in co-authored work, the research maps the relative shares of AI publications
across major global players. The analysis reveals a profound restructuring of
the international AI research landscape. The US and the European Union (EU27),
once the undisputed and established leaders, have experienced a notable decline
in relative dominance, with their combined share of publications falling from
over 57% in 2000 to less than 25% in 2025. In contrast, China has undergone a
dramatic ascent, expanding its global share of AI publications from under 5% in
2000 to nearly 36% by 2025, thereby emerging as the single most dominant
contributor. Alongside China, India has also risen substantially, consolidating
a multipolar Asian research ecosystem. These empirical findings highlight the
strategic implications of concentrated research output, particularly China's
capacity to shape the future direction of AI innovation and standard-setting.
While the study calculates the volume of AI publications (in percentage as
global share) as a measure of research dominance, it also acknowledges
limitations in capturing quality and impact, suggesting scholarly research
areas for future work on high-impact AI scholarship.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI音乐生成和分析研究快速发展，但研究者对伦理影响的关注不足。虽然许多会议引入了伦理声明要求，但这些声明大多流于形式而非实质反思。

Method: 回顾了ISMIR、NIME和过去五年AI音乐领域重要论文中的伦理声明，分析其使用效果。

Result: 发现大多数伦理声明未能有效促进研究者对研究伦理影响的批判性思考，主要呈现公式化合规而非实质性反思。

Conclusion: 建议音频会议和研究者在伦理声明使用上采取更有效的方式，促进有意义的伦理反思而非形式化合规。

Abstract: While research in AI methods for music generation and analysis has grown in
scope and impact, AI researchers' engagement with the ethical consequences of
this work has not kept pace. To encourage such engagement, many publication
venues have introduced optional or required ethics statements for AI research
papers. Though some authors use these ethics statements to critically engage
with the broader implications of their research, we find that the majority of
ethics statements in the AI music literature do not appear to be effectively
utilized for this purpose. In this work, we conduct a review of ethics
statements across ISMIR, NIME, and selected prominent works in AI music from
the past five years. We then offer suggestions for both audio conferences and
researchers for engaging with ethics statements in ways that foster meaningful
reflection rather than formulaic compliance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术在社会中的普及，AI治理变得日益重要，但现有的AI伦理原则存在异质性，且计算机科学课程中缺乏AI政策讨论，需要培养学生适应复杂的AI政策环境。

Method: 通过总结美国和欧盟的AI政策努力，提出指导性问题来构建技术性和非技术性CS课程中的AI政策课堂讨论框架。

Conclusion: 本文为弥合AI政策与CS教育之间的研究差距做出了贡献，强调了培养AI工程师与适应社会政策偏好的重要性。

Abstract: The growth and permeation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across
society has drawn focus to the ways in which the responsible use of these
technologies can be facilitated through AI governance. Increasingly, large
companies and governments alike have begun to articulate and, in some cases,
enforce governance preferences through AI policy. Yet existing literature
documents an unwieldy heterogeneity in ethical principles for AI governance,
while our own prior research finds that discussions of the implications of AI
policy are not yet present in the computer science (CS) curriculum. In this
context, overlapping jurisdictions and even contradictory policy preferences
across private companies, local, national, and multinational governments create
a complex landscape for AI policy which, we argue, will require AI developers
able adapt to an evolving regulatory environment. Preparing computing students
for the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a
key priority for the CS curriculum.
  In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating
discussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses.
We begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and
European Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class
discussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS
courses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy
demands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation
and enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore
represents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions
across the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare
AI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的个性化自动评分和反馈系统，用于几何构造任务，在韩国Algeomath平台上部署，通过GPT-4进行提示式评分，提供迭代式反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化学习在数学教育中日益重要，需要能够评估复杂学生回答并提供实时个性化反馈的智能系统。

Method: 使用大语言模型（GPT-4）开发提示式评分机制，通过少样本学习方法比较学生答案和模型解决方案，基于教师编写的预期学生回答生成反馈，并根据学生解题历史动态调整，允许每个问题最多四次迭代尝试。

Result: 在79名中学生中试点，LLM生成的评分与教师判断高度一致，反馈帮助许多学生修正错误并完成多步骤几何任务。短期修正频繁，但长期迁移效果不明显。

Conclusion: 研究突显了LLM在支持数学中可扩展、与教师一致的形成性评估方面的潜力，同时指出在术语处理和反馈设计方面需要改进。

Abstract: As personalized learning gains increasing attention in mathematics education,
there is a growing demand for intelligent systems that can assess complex
student responses and provide individualized feedback in real time. In this
study, we present a personalized auto-grading and feedback system for
constructive geometry tasks, developed using large language models (LLMs) and
deployed on the Algeomath platform, a Korean online tool designed for
interactive geometric constructions. The proposed system evaluates
student-submitted geometric constructions by analyzing their procedural
accuracy and conceptual understanding. It employs a prompt-based grading
mechanism using GPT-4, where student answers and model solutions are compared
through a few-shot learning approach. Feedback is generated based on
teacher-authored examples built from anticipated student responses, and it
dynamically adapts to the student's problem-solving history, allowing up to
four iterative attempts per question. The system was piloted with 79
middle-school students, where LLM-generated grades and feedback were
benchmarked against teacher judgments. Grading closely aligned with teachers,
and feedback helped many students revise errors and complete multi-step
geometry tasks. While short-term corrections were frequent, longer-term
transfer effects were less clear. Overall, the study highlights the potential
of LLMs to support scalable, teacher-aligned formative assessment in
mathematics, while pointing to improvements needed in terminology handling and
feedback design.

Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online
platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic
behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in
online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious
challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more
detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image,
and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of
usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate
toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large
Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of
toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity
detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has
focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a
pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to
generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It
presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the
context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence
era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on
toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media
platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual
mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in
toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language
Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

Motivation: 开放平台如OpenReview使同行评审过程透明化，提供了前所未有的过程级数据来理解现代同行评审的运作机制。

Method: 整合四个互补维度分析：论文结构与语言质量、提交策略与外部元数据、作者-审稿人互动动态、审稿人分歧与元审稿调解模式。

Result: 研究表明，及时、实质性、互动的作者-审稿人沟通显著提高录用概率；清晰的写作、平衡的视觉呈现、早期提交和有效解决审稿人分歧也与更高录用概率相关。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提出数据驱动的指南，以增强同行评审的透明度和公平性，证明过程中心信号对于理解和改进现代同行评审至关重要。

Abstract: Peer review is the primary mechanism for evaluating scientific contributions,
yet prior studies have mostly examined paper features or external metadata in
isolation. The emergence of open platforms such as OpenReview has transformed
peer review into a transparent and interactive process, recording not only
scores and comments but also rebuttals, reviewer-author exchanges, reviewer
disagreements, and meta-reviewer decisions. This provides unprecedented
process-level data for understanding how modern peer review operates. In this
paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of ICLR 2017-2025, encompassing
over 28,000 submissions. Our analysis integrates four complementary dimensions,
including the structure and language quality of papers (e.g., section patterns,
figure/table ratios, clarity), submission strategies and external metadata
(e.g., timing, arXiv posting, author count), the dynamics of author-reviewer
interactions (e.g., rebuttal frequency, responsiveness), and the patterns of
reviewer disagreement and meta-review mediation (e.g., score variance,
confidence weighting). Our results show that factors beyond scientific novelty
significantly shape acceptance outcomes. In particular, the rebuttal stage
emerges as a decisive phase: timely, substantive, and interactive
author-reviewer communication strongly increases the likelihood of acceptance,
often outweighing initial reviewer skepticism. Alongside this, clearer writing,
balanced visual presentation, earlier submission, and effective resolution of
reviewer disagreement also correlate with higher acceptance probabilities.
Based on these findings, we propose data-driven guidelines for authors,
reviewers, and meta-reviewers to enhance transparency and fairness in peer
review. Our study demonstrates that process-centric signals are essential for
understanding and improving modern peer review.

Conclusion: 该解决方案为监管机构提供前所未有的跨司法管辖区监督能力，金融机构实现无缝合规整合，投资者获得对AI驱动漏洞的关键可见性，呼吁立即行动加强AI驱动金融市场的风险管理。

Abstract: "Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble." As
Shakespeare's witches foretold chaos through cryptic prophecies, modern capital
markets grapple with systemic risks concealed by opaque AI systems. According
to IMF, the August 5, 2024, plunge in Japanese and U.S. equities can be linked
to algorithmic trading yet ab-sent from existing AI incidents database
exemplifies this transparency crisis. Current AI incident databases, reliant on
crowdsourcing or news scraping, systematically over-look capital market
anomalies, particularly in algorithmic and high-frequency trading. We address
this critical gap by proposing a regulatory-grade global database that
elegantly synthesises post-trade reporting frameworks with proven incident
documentation models from healthcare and aviation. Our framework's temporal
data omission technique masking timestamps while preserving percent-age-based
metrics enables sophisticated cross-jurisdictional analysis of emerging risks
while safeguarding confidential business information. Synthetic data validation
(modelled after real life published incidents , sentiments, data) reveals
compelling pat-terns: systemic risks transcending geographical boundaries,
market manipulation clusters distinctly identifiable via K-means algorithms,
and AI system typology exerting significantly greater influence on trading
behaviour than geographical location, This tripartite solution empowers
regulators with unprecedented cross-jurisdictional oversight, financial
institutions with seamless compliance integration, and investors with critical
visibility into previously obscured AI-driven vulnerabilities. We call for
immediate action to strengthen risk management and foster resilience in
AI-driven financial markets against the volatile "cauldron" of AI-driven
systemic risks., promoting global financial stability through enhanced
transparency and coordinated oversight.

Motivation: 技术领域女性代表性不足已成为全球危机，不仅限制人才获取，还影响技术创新视角的多样性，需要系统性地解决这一问题。

Method: 采用结构化文献综述方法，分析早期性别刻板印象、教育环境限制、职业心理挑战等障碍，并评估现有干预措施的有效性。

Conclusion: 文章提出实践和研究意义，并介绍了NEURON项目作为加速女性技术赋权的试点跨学科倡议。

Abstract: Recently, the unequal presence of women compared to men in technology has
attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners across multiple
fields. It is time to regard this problem as a global crisis that not only
limits access to talent but also reduces the diversity of perspectives that
shape technological innovation. This article examines the psychological and
social barriers that influence this gap, as well as the interventions designed
to reduce it. Using a structured review, the findings assemble evidence on the
role of early gender stereotypes in the family and school and the continuation
of this crisis in educational and career choices, through to the psychological
challenges women face in professional settings, such as feelings of
self-undervaluation, occupational anxiety, a heightened fear of technology, and
structural limitations in educational environments. Special attention is paid
to Germany, where the technology gap is particularly evident and where multiple
national programs have been implemented to address it. The present review shows
that effective solutions require more than anti-discrimination policies: they
should include educational practices, organizational reforms, mentoring, and
psychological support. The article concludes by outlining practical and
research implications and introduces the NEURON project as a pilot
interdisciplinary initiative aimed at accelerating current empowerment efforts
and developing new programs for women in technology occupations.

TL;DR: 本研究首次大规模比较了18个当代大语言模型在编程作业自动评分中的表现，发现模型之间存在系统性差异，小型变体表现较差，所有模型与人类教师评分一致性中等，建议教育部署需考虑教学目标和人工监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育领域的应用日益广泛，需要系统评估不同模型在编程作业评分中的表现差异，为教育部署提供实证依据。

Method: 使用超过6,000份学生提交的编程作业，对18个公开可用的大语言模型进行系统评估，采用统计检验、相关性和聚类分析等方法。

Result: 发现模型间存在系统性差异，"mini"和"nano"变体表现一致较差；所有模型内部一致性高，但与人类教师评分只有中等一致性。

Conclusion: 模型选择对教育部署具有重要影响，应基于教学目标、透明评估指标和持续人工监督来确保准确性、公平性和相关性。

Abstract: This study presents the first large-scale, side-by-side comparison of
contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) in the automated grading of
programming assignments. Drawing on over 6,000 student submissions collected
across four years of an introductory programming course, we systematically
analysed the distribution of grades, differences in mean scores and variability
reflecting stricter or more lenient grading, and the consistency and clustering
of grading patterns across models. Eighteen publicly available models were
evaluated: Anthropic (claude-3-5-haiku, claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4);
Deepseek (deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner); Google (gemini-2.0-flash-lite,
gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro); and
OpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5-mini,
gpt-5-nano, gpt-5). Statistical tests, correlation and clustering analyses
revealed clear, systematic differences between and within vendor families, with
"mini" and "nano" variants consistently underperforming their full-scale
counterparts. All models displayed high internal agreement, measured by the
intraclass correlation coefficient, with the model consensus but only moderate
agreement with human teachers' grades, indicating a persistent gap between
automated and human assessment. These findings underscore that the choice of
model for educational deployment is not neutral and should be guided by
pedagogical goals, transparent reporting of evaluation metrics, and ongoing
human oversight to ensure accuracy, fairness and relevance.
