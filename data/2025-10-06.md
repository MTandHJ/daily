### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用Oracle排序器替代专门的奖励模型，结合基于排名的GRPO_rank损失函数，在视频理解任务中优于现有微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集人类反馈成本高昂。现有RLAIF方法依赖训练专门的奖励模型，流程昂贵且受限。

Method: 使用Oracle排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非打分，提出基于GRPO的GRPO_rank排名损失函数，直接优化序数反馈。

Result: Oracle-RLAIF在各种视频理解基准测试中一致优于领先的视频语言模型现有微调方法。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为通过排名而非分数的强化学习对齐大型多模态视频模型提供了灵活且数据高效的框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [3] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)
*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHMR是一个统一的框架，直接从单目视频学习视觉到动作的策略，在物理模拟器中控制人形角色，实现物理合理且视觉对齐的运动重建。

Conclusion: PhysHMR通过统一的视觉到动作学习框架，实现了物理基础和视觉对齐的运动重建，解决了传统两阶段方法的误差累积问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Method: 使用专家和非专家面部识别者的数据，分析人-人和人-机协作的效果。提出了近端准确率规则(PAR)，建立了关键融合区域，并实施了智能人机融合策略，通过选择有潜力提升高精度机器性能的人类参与者来优化系统。

Result: 研究发现协作效益随着协作者间基线准确率差异的减小而增加。关键融合区域范围很大，即使人类准确率低于机器，融合也能提升系统准确率。智能人机融合比单独使用机器或简单融合所有判断更准确。

Conclusion: 研究证明了人类和机器在确保准确面部识别中都有重要作用，为AI在面部识别中的智能使用提供了基于证据的路线图。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次提出了用于生成视频模型的不确定性量化框架S-QUBED，通过潜在空间建模将预测不确定性分解为任意性和认知性成分，并提出了基于稳健秩相关的校准评估指标。


<details>

Motivation: 生成视频模型容易产生事实错误的幻觉内容，但现有研究缺乏对视频模型的不确定性量化方法，存在严重的安全隐患。

Method: 提出S-QUBED框架：基于稳健秩相关的校准评估指标；黑盒UQ方法，通过潜在建模将不确定性分解为任意性和认知性成分；构建UQ数据集用于基准测试。

Result: 实验表明S-QUBED能计算校准的总不确定性估计，与任务准确度负相关，并能有效分解不确定性的不同成分。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对生成视频模型的不确定性量化工作，为视频模型的安全部署提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [6] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)方法，通过优化文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像的美学质量，无需额外训练且与骨干模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示词下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，希望通过优化文本嵌入来改善生成效果。

Method: 使用三重目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化后文本嵌入的一致性、通过提示词保留项最小化与初始提示词的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估证实了该方法的有效性，在性能上超过或等同于最先进的文本到图像和提示词适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO是一种无需训练、骨干模型无关的有效方法，能够显著提升简单提示词下生成图像的美学质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

### [7] [Ego-Exo 3D Hand Tracking in the Wild with a Mobile Multi-Camera Rig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02601)
*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型无标记多相机系统，用于在真实野外条件下捕捉精确的3D手部和物体数据，解决了现有数据集环境多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手部跟踪数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，限制了环境多样性和模型泛化能力，需要开发能在真实野外条件下准确跟踪手部及其与物体交互的方法。

Method: 设计轻量级背戴式捕捉装置，配备8个外中心相机和Meta Quest 3头显提供2个自我中心视角，开发了自我-外中心跟踪流程来生成准确的3D手部姿态真值。

Result: 构建了包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿态的标注数据集，显著降低了环境真实性与3D标注精度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在近乎无约束的移动条件下实现精确的3D手部跟踪，为野外环境下的手部交互研究提供了高质量的数据支持。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [8] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于输入感知的稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失的视频蒸馏方法，将多步扩散模型压缩为少步学生模型，实现了实时性能并提升了视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的语音驱动视频生成方法由于需要大量去噪步骤和昂贵的注意力机制，导致推理速度慢，无法实现实时部署。

Method: 1. 使用输入人体姿态关键点的精确对应关系来引导注意力到相关区域（如说话者的面部、手部和上半身）；2. 提出输入感知稀疏注意力减少冗余计算并增强身体部位的时序对应关系；3. 引入输入感知蒸馏损失来改善唇部同步和手部运动真实性。

Result: 该方法实现了实时性能，并在视觉质量上优于最近的音频驱动和输入驱动方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合输入感知稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，该方法在保持高质量的同时显著提升了推理效率，为实时语音驱动视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型在持续适应过程中面临灾难性遗忘的挑战，现有方法依赖合成数据会导致性能下降且训练时间不断增加。

Method: 设计基于低秩适应的功能LoRA方法，专门使用秩1矩阵，通过精心选择的函数增加重参数化矩阵的秩，实现动态条件机制。

Result: 实验表明FunLoRA在基于流匹配的模型上超越了现有基于扩散模型的方法，达到更高的分类准确率，同时只需少量内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA提供了一种参数高效的微调方法，能有效避免灾难性遗忘，在持续学习场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [10] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双视场、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，通过统一的三层防御堆栈框架提高对数字和自然退化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全，现有方法缺乏对时间连续性、多静态视场感知以及数字和自然退化鲁棒性的考虑。

Method: 基于多源数据集构建双视场序列保持框架，采用特征压缩、防御性蒸馏和基于熵的异常检测的三层防御堆栈，结合序列时间投票进行增强。

Result: 统一防御堆栈实现了79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降低至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，同时将高风险误分类降至32%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了交通灯和标志识别系统对对抗性攻击和环境退化的鲁棒性，为自动驾驶安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

### [11] [Smart-GRPO: Smartly Sampling Noise for Efficient RL of Flow-Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02654)
*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO是首个针对流匹配模型中强化学习的噪声扰动优化方法，通过迭代搜索策略改进噪声分布，提升奖励优化和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型的确定性特性使其不适合强化学习，而现有方法通过随机噪声扰动效率低且不稳定。

Method: 采用迭代搜索策略：解码候选扰动、用奖励函数评估、向高奖励区域优化噪声分布。

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从稀疏自由图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过端到端的高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强的场景优化，解决了现有方法需要密集校准视图的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法需要密集校准视图，从稀疏自由图像重建时由于重叠有限和过拟合问题导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用基于贡献的修剪消除局部漂浮物，在快速优化期间利用深度和多视图特征监督结合可微相机参数缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从稀疏自由图像的高质量表面重建，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

TL;DR: MoGIC是一个统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过整合意图建模和视觉先验，解决了现有方法在捕捉动作执行因果逻辑和人类意图方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法将合成视为语言与运动之间的双向映射，但难以捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑和驱动行为的人类意图。缺乏视觉基础进一步限制了精度和个性化。

Method: 提出MoGIC框架，通过联合优化多模态条件运动生成和意图预测，揭示潜在的人类目标，利用视觉先验增强生成。引入具有自适应范围的注意力混合机制，实现条件标记与运动子序列的有效局部对齐。

Result: 微调后，MoGIC在HumanML3D上FID降低38.6%，在Mo440H上降低34.6%，在运动字幕生成方面超越基于LLM的方法，并进一步实现意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC推进了可控运动合成和意图理解，展示了多模态生成能力，并构建了440小时的Mo440H基准数据集。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Net2Net结合无监督DIP和预训练DRUNet网络，通过RED正则化实现真实世界噪声去除，无需大量标注数据即可适应不同噪声模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，难以处理真实噪声复杂性；深度学习需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。需要一种能结合两者优势的方法。

Method: Net2Net混合框架结合无监督DIP网络（适应输入图像特定噪声）和预训练DRUNet网络（利用大规模数据集学习表示），通过RED正则化进行集成。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面表现优越，特别是在训练数据有限的场景下。

Conclusion: Net2Net通过结合无监督和预训练网络的优势，有效解决了真实世界噪声去除的挑战，提升了跨不同噪声模式的泛化能力。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提高检索准确性，解决了DeepSeek-R1直接应用于检索任务时的计算成本高和训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了RL增强LLM推理能力的潜力，但直接应用于检索任务存在两个主要问题：高计算成本（多候选推理过程消耗大量token）和训练不稳定/结果不理想。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量但保留关键信息；提出新训练范式，包括使用检索定制合成CoT数据集的激活阶段，以及采用课程奖励的RL训练。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过信息压缩和新的训练范式，Retrv-R1成功解决了RL在检索任务中的应用挑战，为多模态检索提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

TL;DR: BCA+是一个无需训练、无需反向传播的测试时自适应框架，通过动态缓存机制和贝叶斯推理，同时适应对象识别和检测任务中的分布偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法要么依赖计算昂贵的反向传播，要么只关注似然适应而忽略先验的重要性，限制了实时部署效果。

Method: 引入动态缓存存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度及自适应类别先验，将适应问题建模为贝叶斯推理，通过不确定性引导的融合机制结合初始VLM输出和缓存预测。

Result: 在识别和检测基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: BCA+通过双适应机制和不确定性引导融合，能够同时修正模型的语义理解和上下文置信度，为实时部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HGCD-BT的层次化广义类别发现方法，用于脑肿瘤分类，能够同时识别已知和未知肿瘤类别，在OpenSRH数据集上比现有GCD方法准确率提升28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义类别，无法识别训练时未见的肿瘤类型。广义类别发现(GCD)虽然能识别已知和未知类别，但缺乏对脑肿瘤层次化分类结构的考虑。

Method: 将层次化聚类与对比学习相结合，在对比学习基础上引入半监督层次化聚类损失函数，构建层次化广义类别发现框架。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，patch级分类准确率比最先进GCD方法提升28%，特别是在识别未见肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在Digital Brain Tumor Atlas的slide级分类中也验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT方法能有效处理脑肿瘤的层次化分类结构，在识别已知和未知肿瘤类别方面表现出色，且具有跨成像模态的通用性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key是一种无需训练的关键帧采样模块，用于查询驱动的长视频理解，通过最大化统一的相关性-多样性目标来选择信息丰富且非冗余的帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型依赖均匀采样，往往忽略关键时刻；而关键帧选择方法要么施加严格的时间间隔限制，错过精细线索，要么强调视觉多样性但忽略查询相关性。

Method: 提出最大化统一的相关性-多样性最大体积目标，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件，并采用轻量级相关性感知门控机制处理弱对齐查询。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和Video-MME上的广泛实验展示了最先进的性能，特别是在长视频上，计算效率高，可在单个GPU上实时运行。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key是一种无需训练、计算高效且与现有视觉语言模型兼容的即插即用解决方案，显著提升了长视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但它们在复杂横向思维挑战（如字谜）上的认知过程仍然不透明。现有研究表明这些模型在字谜解决方面表现不佳，但底层推理过程和失败模式尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究贡献了一个包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别，并建立了一个将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架。调查了三种提示策略，旨在引出不同类型的解释过程。

Result: 研究发现推理质量在不同谜题类别间差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现出系统性优势，但在缺失解释和文化象征方面存在根本性局限性。提示策略显著影响认知方法和问题解决效果。

Conclusion: 可解释性应被视为模型性能的组成部分，而非事后考虑。研究揭示了视觉语言模型在复杂横向思维任务中的认知过程和局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Motivation: 现有文本移除研究主要关注自然图像中的场景文本，但当前数据集存在地面真值伪影、背景过于简单和评估指标不准确等问题，限制了跨域泛化能力。

Method: 采用合成方法生成文本移除基准，使用对象感知的文本放置和视觉语言模型生成的内容，在复杂背景上渲染文本，确保干净的地面真值和具有挑战性的文本移除场景。

Result: 创建了一个适用于场景文本以外领域的文本移除基准数据集，该数据集可在Hugging Face上获取。

Conclusion: 提出的合成方法能够生成更真实和具有挑战性的文本移除基准，有助于改进文本移除模型的跨域泛化能力和评估准确性。

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单、检测器无关的框架，通过模态上下文注意力(MoCA)和查询表示对齐(QueryREPA)来对齐DETR风格对象查询与模态上下文，解决多模态医学图像检测中的统计异质性和表示空间不匹配问题。

Motivation: 解决单一检测器在混合医学模态(如CXR、CT、MRI)上训练时，由于统计异质性和不相交表示空间导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 1. 定义模态标记：紧凑的文本派生嵌入，编码成像模态；2. 通过多模态上下文注意力(MoCA)将模态标记集成到检测过程中；3. 引入QueryREPA预训练阶段，使用任务特定的对比目标对齐查询表示与模态标记。

Result: 该方法在多种模态联合训练时，持续提高AP指标，且开销极小，无需架构修改。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为稳健的多模态医学对象检测提供了一条实用路径，能有效生成模态感知、类别忠实的查询，并很好地迁移到下游训练。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Motivation: 现有方法如对比解码难以构建合适的对比样本，注意力操作方法敏感且缺乏稳定性，需要更有效的方法来解决LVLMs的幻觉问题

Method: 利用LVLMs中的"图像头"，通过掩码这些头来构建对比样本，然后进行对比解码

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b上的评估显示，MaskCD在CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试中有效缓解幻觉现象

Conclusion: MaskCD方法能够有效减轻大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，同时保持模型的通用能力

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应权重学习和渐进增强策略，有效解决了K到N医学图像合成中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更灵活的模态重建能力。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Motivation: 需要一种准确、非破坏性的鸡蛋质量评估方法来确保食品安全、维持产品标准和提高商业家禽生产效率。

Method: 使用预训练CNN模型提取外部鸡蛋图像特征，结合形状和重量特征，通过PCA降维、SMOTE增强和集成投票机制进行分类。

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kenshin-Keeps/Egg_Quality_Prediction_ELMF4EggQ, promoting
transparency, reproducibility, and further research in this domain.

Motivation: 现有的零样本描述模型局限于全局表示和整图描述，无法描述图像中的特定区域。

Method: 将单个图像补丁作为原子描述单元，通过聚合补丁特征来描述任意区域（从单个补丁到非连续区域和整图）。

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示对于可扩展的描述生成非常有效，在密集描述、区域集描述和轨迹描述任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in

### [28] [Representation Learning for Compressed Video Action Recognition via Attentive Cross-modal Interaction with Motion Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03569)
*Bing Li,Jiaxin Chen,Dongming Zhang,Xiuguo Bao,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MEACI-Net框架，通过多尺度去噪模块增强运动流表示，并引入选择性运动补充和跨模态增强模块来加强RGB与运动模态的交互，提升压缩视频动作识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别面临两个主要问题：运动线索粗糙噪声多，以及RGB和运动模态融合不足。

Method: 采用双流架构，运动流使用多尺度块和去噪模块增强表示，通过SMC模块补充RGB模态的局部运动特征，CMA模块进行选择性特征增强融合。

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试上表现出有效性和效率。

Conclusion: MEACI-Net通过运动增强和跨模态交互有效解决了压缩视频动作识别中的关键问题。

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

*Laith Nayal,Hadi Salloum,Ahmad Taha,Yaroslav Kholodov,Alexander Gasnikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的简单方法，利用InternImage骨干网络特征，通过K-Means聚类和置信度阈值来检测语义分割中的未知物体，在多个基准测试中超越了有监督和无监督基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉基础模型在封闭集语义任务中表现出色，但其在语义分割中检测分布外区域的能力尚未充分探索。研究旨在验证经过分割数据集微调的基础模型是否能够无需异常监督即可区分分布内和分布外区域。

Method: 提出了一种简单的无需训练方法：利用InternImage骨干网络特征，应用K-Means聚类并结合原始解码器logits的置信度阈值来识别分布外聚类。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试中达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试中达到48.77平均精度，使用InternImage-L模型超越了多个有监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明这是一种有前景的方向，用于开发需要最少假设或额外数据的通用分布外分割方法。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，在不同空间区域自适应分配剪枝预算，以在高效推理时保持全局视觉上下文信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，而基于注意力机制的剪枝方法在高剪枝率下性能下降明显，因为它们倾向于保留语义相似的token。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角重新思考token保留，通过在不同空间裁剪区域自适应分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token捕获全局视觉上下文而非孤立显著特征。

Result: 实验表明HoloV在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝率下均优于现有方法。例如，LLaVA1.5使用HoloV在剪枝88.9%视觉token后仍保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过整体视角的token剪枝策略，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算开销，实现了优越的效率-准确性权衡。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW)方法，通过置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化来增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，在保持泛化能力的同时提升干净和鲁棒准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：(1) 置信度感知损失，通过缩放干净和对抗预测之间的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本；(2) 特征对齐正则化，通过在对抗输入上最小化冻结和微调图像编码器特征之间的距离来保持语义一致性。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAW在AutoAttack等强攻击下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，同时使用更少内存。

Conclusion: CAW方法有效提升了视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，在保持泛化能力的同时显著改善了对抗攻击下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型视觉语言模型在整合超声成像与临床数据用于颈动脉粥样硬化风险评估的潜力，通过领域适应和多模态集成显著提升了卒中风险分层性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样化的临床和影像信息，但目前缺乏透明且可解释的方法。本研究旨在探索大型视觉语言模型在多模态颈动脉斑块评估中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出了一个模拟真实诊断场景的框架，比较了多种开源LVLM模型。通过低秩适应（LoRA）将LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna模型适应到超声领域，并整合多模态表格数据。

Result: 零样本实验显示大多数LVLM无法准确识别影像模态和解剖结构，风险分类表现差。经过领域适应后，卒中风险分层性能显著提升，多模态数据集成进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率，性能与先前基于CNN的基线模型相当。

Conclusion: LVLM在基于超声的心血管风险预测中具有潜力但也存在局限性，多模态集成、模型校准和领域适应对临床转化至关重要。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用深度自编码器生成器参数效率低，缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进多期相增强MRI合成中的共享和独立特征分离。

Method: 使用Flip Distribution Alignment VAE，将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，采用Y形双向训练策略增强特征分离的可解释性。

Result: 相比现有深度自编码器端到端合成方法，FDA-VAE显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提高合成质量。

Conclusion: FDA-VAE为多期相增强MRI合成提供了一种轻量级且可解释的解决方案，在参数效率和合成质量方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LPG-Bench基准测试和TIT评估方法，用于评估长提示文本到图像生成的质量，解决了现有模型对长详细提示理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在处理长而详细的提示时表现不佳，生成结果不一致，缺乏专门的评估基准和方法。

Method: 构建了包含200个平均长度超过250词提示的LPG-Bench基准，从13个先进模型生成2600张图像并进行人工标注；提出了基于文本-图像-文本一致性的TIT评估方法，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现。

Result: 实验表明现有T2I评估指标与人类偏好一致性差，TIT-Score-LLM在成对准确率上比最强基线提升7.31%，与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为评估和促进T2I模型发展提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法存在速度慢、几何失真、依赖手动3D掩码等问题，需要开发更实用和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 构建3DEditVerse数据集（116,309训练对+1,500测试对），并提出3DEditFormer条件变换器模型，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控机制来保持3D结构。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中均优于现有最先进方法，为实用和可扩展的3D编辑设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 该框架通过数据和模型创新成功解决了3D编辑的关键挑战，实现了无需辅助3D掩码的精确一致编辑。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，在热带多云地区实用性受限，需要解决云遮挡导致的光学图像数据缺失问题，同时缓解深度网络中编码器下采样导致的空间和光谱细节丢失。

Method: 开发云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖；提出轻量级方法将归一化差异指数(NDIs)注入最终解码层，以最小计算成本保留关键空间特征；结合Sentinel-1雷达数据填补光学图像云遮挡区域。

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，NDI注入使U-Net性能提升1.99%，DeepLabV3提升2.78%；在云覆盖条件下，结合Sentinel-1数据相比仅使用光学数据在所有模型上均获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 雷达-光学数据融合在挑战性大气条件下具有显著效果，轻量级NDI注入方法能有效增强土地覆盖语义分割性能，为多云地区遥感应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Result: PocketSR仅146M参数，处理4K图像仅需0.8秒，性能与最先进的单步和多步RealSR模型相当。

Conclusion: PocketSR在保持高质量的同时实现了显著的速度提升，为边缘设备上的RealSR应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event
conditioning in future models.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Conclusion: 组合泛化能力受到训练目标分布特性和条件信息提供程度的显著影响，在离散模型中引入连续辅助目标可以有效提升组合泛化性能。

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在个性化方面表现出色，但引发了数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用的担忧。现有基于像素空间的图像投毒方法存在噪声和伪影问题，需要更不可察觉的防御方法。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，交替进行去噪和反演过程，同时修改去噪轨迹的起点。这种轨迹偏移采样确保扰动图像保持高视觉保真度，同时对下游生成模型的反演和个性化具有抵抗力。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的验证表明，该方法在不可察觉性指标（PSNR、SSIM、FID）上提升了约8%-10%，在五种对抗设置下的鲁棒性平均提升了约10%，能有效抵御最先进的反演攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将不可学习性集成到潜在扩散模型框架中，提供了一种实用且不可察觉的防御机制，能够有效保护敏感数据免受未经授权的模型适应。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在辐射场语义蒸馏中几何基础特征与纯视觉特征的对比，发现几何基础特征包含更多几何细节但会降低姿态估计精度，而纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中更具通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索几何基础语义特征在蒸馏辐射场中的潜在优势，特别是在空间任务如姿态估计中是否比纯视觉特征更具优势。

Method: 提出SPINE框架进行无初始猜测的辐射场反演，包含基于蒸馏语义的粗反演和基于光度优化的精细反演两个核心组件。

Result: 几何基础特征包含更精细的结构细节，但在语义目标定位任务中无显著差异，且会降低姿态估计精度；纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 纯视觉特征在通用性方面优于几何基础特征，未来需要研究更有效的几何基础策略来增强预训练语义特征的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个新颖的参考驱动图像补全框架，通过引入显式3D结构指导来增强几何一致性，解决了现有方法在目标视图与参考图像差异较大时产生的错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机姿态或深度），导致补全内容错位或不合理。当目标视图与参考图像差异显著时，这个问题尤为突出。

Method: 提出双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征。通过联合自注意力确保一致性。引入目标感知掩码策略，在训练时掩码参考图像中的遮挡区域。

Result: 实验表明GeoComplete在PSNR指标上比最先进方法提升了17.1，显著提高了几何准确性同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过结合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Motivation: 解决文本到声音视频生成中的两个关键挑战：共享文本标题导致的模态干扰，以及跨模态特征交互机制不明确的问题。

Method: 使用分层视觉基础字幕生成框架生成解耦的视频和音频字幕，并引入BridgeDiT双塔扩散变换器，采用双向交叉注意力机制实现语义和时间同步。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在大多数指标上达到了最先进的结果，并通过消融研究验证了各贡献的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来的文本到声音视频生成任务提供了关键见解，代码和检查点将公开发布。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的两个层次区域，分别提取结构和语义特征，结合潜在扩散先验和CLIP嵌入，使用Versatile Diffusion模型合成图像，在复杂场景中提升了重建的结构和语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重建复杂视觉刺激时面临挑战，因为自然场景的低级特征具有异质性，高级特征存在语义纠缠。受视觉皮层层次表示理论启发，需要分离不同层次的特征提取。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验；语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入；通过Versatile Diffusion模型集成这些组件合成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，HAVIR在复杂场景中提升了重建图像的结构和语义质量，性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR模型通过层次化分离视觉皮层特征提取，有效解决了复杂视觉刺激重建的挑战，为神经科学和计算机视觉的跨学科整合提供了新思路。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个用于交互中心视频生成的两阶段框架，无需密集掩码输入，通过预测运动轨迹生成高质量交互视频


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂动态交互，且获取精确掩码标注在现实应用中具有挑战性

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段流程：首先预测演员和物体的运动轨迹，然后基于这些轨迹生成视频

Result: 在人类-物体交互和机器人操作场景中，相比现有基线方法实现了更优越的视觉真实性和可控性

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架有效解决了交互视频生成中的掩码依赖问题，提供了灵活直观的控制方式

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，是导致残疾的主要原因，但AI辅助诊断因缺乏椎体级别感知的多模态数据集而受限。临床决策需要在X光、CT和MRI上对特定椎体级别进行复杂推理。

Method: 采用临床医生参与的两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订），从教科书、指南、开放数据集和约1000个医院病例中构建了包含45万指令实例的SpineMed-450k数据集，并开发了SpineBench评估框架。

Result: 对多个先进大视觉语言模型的评估显示在细粒度椎体级别推理方面存在系统性弱点，而在SpineMed-450k上微调的模型在所有任务上都表现出显著改进，临床医生评估确认了其诊断清晰度和实用性。

Conclusion: SpineMed生态系统通过提供高质量椎体级别指令数据和标准化评估基准，显著提升了脊柱疾病AI诊断的性能，解决了该领域的关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Conclusion: UniShield系统通过多智能体框架有效解决了伪造图像检测和定位中的跨领域泛化问题，为维护信息完整性和社会安全提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,

Result: 在重建性能上显著优于现有方法，PSNR达到37dB（之前为27dB），FID、LPIPS和CMMD分数降低高达96%。发现VQ和PQ在扩展嵌入维度时表现相反。

Conclusion: PQGAN证明了产品量化在图像合成中作为离散潜在表示的强大扩展，能够与预训练扩散模型无缝集成，实现更高效的生成或更高分辨率的输出。

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型在模拟游戏玩法时面临挑战：需要生成自然的新场景内容，同时保持已探索区域的空间一致性。在有限计算预算下，模型必须在有限上下文窗口中压缩和利用历史线索，这暴露了时间记忆与空间记忆之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: Memory Forcing框架通过精心设计的训练协议和几何索引空间记忆，成功解决了自回归视频扩散模型在长期空间一致性和新场景生成质量之间的权衡问题，为世界建模和交互式场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

TL;DR: MonSTeR是首个运动-场景-文本检索模型，通过构建统一潜在空间来捕捉多模态间的复杂依赖关系，在多种任务中实现灵活而鲁棒的检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏评估骨骼运动（运动）、意图（文本）和周围环境（场景）之间对齐的工具，尽管这种机制在人类复杂环境运动中很直观。

Method: 受高阶关系建模启发，MonSTeR利用单模态和跨模态表示构建统一潜在空间，捕捉模态间的复杂依赖关系。

Result: MonSTeR在性能上超越了仅依赖单模态表示的三模态模型，并通过用户研究验证了检索分数与人类偏好的一致性。

Conclusion: MonSTeR展示了其在零样本场景内物体放置和运动字幕生成等任务中的多功能性，证明了统一潜在空间的有效性。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机共振的测试时防御机制，通过引入小幅度平移扰动来增强模型对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性，无需训练且适用于多种网络架构和任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖特征过滤或平滑，会导致信息损失。本文旨在开发一种既能提升鲁棒性又能最小化信息损失的训练无关防御机制。

Method: 采用"以噪声对抗噪声"策略，利用随机共振原理：对输入图像引入小幅度平移扰动，对齐变换后的特征嵌入，聚合后再映射回原始参考图像，整个过程可用闭式公式表达。

Result: 在图像分类任务中恢复高达68.1%的准确率损失，在立体匹配中恢复71.9%，在光流估计中恢复29.2%，在各种对抗攻击下均表现出最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法首次为密集预测任务建立了通用的测试时防御机制，具有完全训练无关、架构无关和攻击无关的特点，展现了方法的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机神经网络方法主要关注改进跨信息预测，未对整体网络架构进行重大改进，需要更有效的纹理表示学习方法。

Method: 使用超球面随机嵌入结合双分支学习模块，捕获通道内和通道间关系，并通过新制定的优化问题构建丰富的纹理表示。

Result: 在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中取得了有趣的结果。

Conclusion: Mixer方法在纹理识别任务中表现出色，源代码将在发表后提供。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RULER tokens和I-MRoPE两种创新方法，通过显式坐标标记和改善空间编码来解决GUI grounding任务中的分辨率外推问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在GUI grounding任务中面临核心瓶颈：可靠的patch-to-pixel映射在训练未见的高分辨率显示上失效，导致坐标生成不准确。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，让模型能够像地图上的网格线一样参考位置；2. Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE)通过确保宽度和高度维度平等表示来改善空间编码。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示，接地准确性持续提升，特别是在高分辨率界面上改进最大。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而非依赖隐式学习，该方法能够在不同分辨率和平台上实现更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

TL;DR: LEAML是一个标签高效的多模态大语言模型适应框架，利用少量标注数据和大量未标注图像，通过伪问答对生成和选择性神经元更新，在医学影像等专业领域实现优于标准微调的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在通用视觉基准上表现良好，但在医学影像等专业领域的分布外任务中表现不佳，这些领域标注数据有限且昂贵。

Method: 使用QA生成器通过标题蒸馏生成领域相关的伪问答对，并选择性更新与问答最相关的神经元，使QA生成器在蒸馏过程中高效获取领域特定知识。

Result: 在胃肠道内窥镜和体育VQA任务上的实验表明，LEAML在最小监督下始终优于标准微调方法。

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺的专业领域具有显著有效性，为多模态大语言模型的领域适应提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于极端值预测的数据增强框架，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强技术，使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，特别关注极端区域的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端值预测这一具有挑战性的问题，该问题在金融和气候变化等领域有广泛应用。传统方法在处理类别不平衡问题时主要关注模式分类和计算机视觉应用，而本研究专注于极端值预测场景。

Method: 使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，结合GANs和SMOTE数据增强技术。提出基于相关函数的策略来整合数据增强，特别考虑极端值。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在短期和长期预测中都表现出更好的适应性。Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据集中表现优异，而BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据增强技术特别是SMOTE方法能有效提升极端值预测性能，不同深度学习模型在不同类型数据中具有互补优势。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型家族，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，解决了LLMs无法处理时间序列的局限性。提供了两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多模态数据处理方面表现出色，但在医学领域面临无法处理时间序列数据的重大限制。为了克服这一差距，需要开发能够理解时间序列数据的模型，以合成临床信息为可操作的见解。

Method: 提出两种架构：1) OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt：通过软提示将可学习的时间序列标记与文本标记连接，进行隐式建模；2) OpenTSLM-Flamingo：通过交叉注意力将时间序列与文本集成，进行显式建模。在三个数据集上进行基准测试。

Result: 在所有测试中，OpenTSLM模型均优于基线方法：睡眠分期达到69.9 F1，HAR达到65.4，而仅文本微调模型分别为9.05和52.2。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM模型也超过了GPT-4o。Flamingo版本在长序列上表现更好且内存需求稳定。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功地将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，在医疗时间序列推理任务中表现出色。显式建模方法在性能和内存效率方面优于隐式方法，为时间序列理解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段架构解决雷达体积场到稀疏点观测的转换问题，显著提升降雨场重建精度和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑关键结构，无法捕捉急剧变化和局地极端降雨，影响了洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析的准确性。

Method: RainSeer采用物理信息驱动的两阶段架构：结构到点映射器通过双向映射将中尺度雷达结构投影到局地地面降雨，地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降过程中的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公开数据集（RAIN-F和MeteoNet）上的评估显示，RainSeer相比最先进基线方法，MAE降低了超过13.31%，并显著提升了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理结构先验，有效解决了降雨场重建中的结构保持问题，为高精度降雨监测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

TL;DR: 提出了Advisor Models，一种轻量级参数化策略，通过强化学习训练，能够对黑盒模型进行动态的自然语言引导，相比静态提示优化具有更好的适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，模型权重无法修改，只能通过提示进行定制。静态提示优化产生固定提示，无法适应不同输入、用户或环境的变化。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），在输入和模型之间插入小型模型，根据环境奖励信号对每个实例进行行为塑造。

Result: 在推理和个性化等多个领域，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提升下游任务性能。同时展示了顾问模型在黑盒模型间的可迁移性，以及在保持对分布外输入鲁棒性的同时实现专业化的能力。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，其中顾问充当参数化、环境特定的记忆。通过Advisor Models对黑盒模型进行动态优化是实现个性化和环境适应性AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的训练数据选择方法，通过市场机制自动整合多种信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），使用单一流动性参数控制集中度，在固定计算预算下实现多信号数据筛选的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法中，不同效用信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等）通常需要人工设置权重进行组合，缺乏系统性和透明度。需要一种能够自动、透明地整合多种信号的方法。

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个样本定价，信号作为交易者，通过单一流动性参数控制集中度，主题归一化稳定校准。引入价格-每令牌规则处理令牌预算，轻量级多样性头提高覆盖范围。

Result: 在GSM8K（60k令牌预算）上，带多样性的市场方法与强单信号基线表现相当，同时减少种子方差，选择开销小于0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews（保留5-25%数据）上，市场方法在保持竞争力的准确率同时提高了平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架在固定计算预算下为提示级推理和分类任务提供了统一的多信号数据筛选方法，实现了透明可控的信号聚合。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练量化虽然能降低计算和存储成本，但在安全关键部署环境中，输入分布的变化可能导致灾难性的性能下降，需要研究这种极端失败的情况。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏和强化学习来学习网络和比特宽度策略对，分析量化下的最坏情况性能潜力，通过系统实验识别最高脆弱点。

Result: 发现了存在"有害"的网络-策略对，多个实例显示准确率下降10-65%，而"鲁棒"对应物仅下降<2%，确认了极端失败情况的存在。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在现实世界部署中需要谨慎，鼓励对鲁棒性进行更严格的检查，并在深度学习领域更重视安全考虑。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种实用的、恒定内存的替代方案，与剪枝和模型压缩互补，实现高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器如TabPFN在生物分子功效预测中表现良好，但其性能对提供的上下文高度敏感。如何在无真实标签的情况下选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放性问题。

Method: 采用基于不确定性的模型选择策略，使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，通过预测的inter-quantile range(IQR)作为不确定性度量，选择并平均具有最低平均IQR的模型集成。

Result: 在siRNA敲低功效任务中，TabPFN模型超越了专门的先进预测器。模型预测的IQR与真实预测误差呈负相关，基于最低平均IQR的模型集成相比朴素集成或单一模型获得了更优性能。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是优化生物分子功效预测的强大、无需标签的启发式方法。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Method: 结合架构改进和算法优化，针对transformer注意力机制和MLP层进行优化，最大化模型FLOPs利用率，同时保持与标准transformer实现的兼容性。

Result: 在3B和30B参数Llama模型上使用SlimPajama-627B数据集进行测试，在多节点H200 GPU集群上实现2-6倍训练吞吐量提升和55%-83%能耗降低。

Conclusion: Litespark的优化方法具有模型和硬件无关性，可广泛应用于各种transformer架构，并扩展到监督微调和直接偏好优化等后训练阶段。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

*Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez,Cameron Allen,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF)方法，通过对比学习从高维观测中发现可独立控制的潜在变量，解决了传统方法需要先验因子表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因子化MDP方法需要已知因子表示，而深度强化学习无法利用因子结构。ACF旨在从高维观测中自动发现可控制因子。

Method: 使用对比学习方法，利用动作稀疏性（每个动作只影响部分变量）来发现可独立控制的潜在变量。

Result: 在Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey三个基准测试中，ACF能够从像素观测中恢复真实可控因子，优于基线解缠算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功解决了从高维观测中发现可控因子的表示问题，为结合因子化MDP和深度强化学习提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合深度强化学习(DRL)和有界极值搜索(ES)的混合控制器，提高非线性时变系统的鲁棒性控制性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL在处理多参数系统时具有快速学习能力，但对时变系统适应性差；ES能处理时变系统但收敛速度慢且易陷局部最优。两者结合可互补优势

Method: 设计DRL与有界ES的混合控制器，DRL利用历史数据快速控制多参数系统，ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性

Result: 混合控制器性能优于单独使用DRL或ES，在洛斯阿拉莫斯中子科学中心线性粒子加速器的低能束流传输段自动调谐中验证了有效性

Conclusion: DRL与有界ES的结合能够产生协同效应，既保持了DRL的快速学习能力，又增强了系统对时变性的鲁棒性

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

TL;DR: CHORD框架通过设备-云协作实现个性化混合精度量化，为序列推荐提供资源自适应部署方案，无需本地重训练即可实现动态模型适配和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备能力提升使得在设备上直接部署重排序模型成为可能，但资源异构性需要模型压缩。现有量化方法忽略了设备特定用户兴趣，导致推荐准确性下降，而设备端微调又带来额外计算负担。

Method: CHORD在异构设备上分发随机初始化模型，通过云端的辅助超网络模块识别用户特定关键参数。参数敏感性分析在多个粒度（层、过滤器、元素级别）进行，实现从用户画像到量化策略的精确映射。使用通道级混合精度量化，仅用每通道2位编码量化策略。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集和两个流行骨干网络（SASRec和Caser）上的实验证明了CHORD在准确性、效率和适应性方面的优势。

Conclusion: CHORD框架成功解决了设备端推荐模型部署中的个性化与资源自适应平衡问题，通过设备-云协作实现了无需重训练的混合精度量化，显著降低了通信开销。

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了监督微调(SFT)与逆强化学习的等价性，证明SFT不仅学习策略，还学习隐式的密集token级奖励模型，并提出了从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上将SFT视为简单的模仿学习过程，本文挑战这一观点，旨在证明SFT实际上是更强大的奖励学习机制。

Method: 建立SFT与逆Q学习的等价性，提出基线相对奖励函数来从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，并开发Dense-Path REINFORCE方法。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE方法在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于原始SFT模型。

Conclusion: 本研究重新定义了SFT，不仅作为策略模仿，更作为强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示数据开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差学习框架，通过在多块交叉阵列片上顺序学习来补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差，从而在有限状态设备上实现片上训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉阵列直接在内存中进行深度神经网络计算，但有效的内存内训练通常需要至少8位电导状态才能匹配数字基线。实际中许多有前景的忆阻器件（如ReRAM）由于制造限制仅提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度会显著降低训练精度。

Method: 提出残差学习框架，在多块交叉阵列片上顺序学习以补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差。理论分析表明最优性差距随片数增加而缩小，并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存内训练策略，成本分析确认仅产生适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了有限状态忆阻器件在片上训练中的精度问题，通过残差学习框架实现了高效且准确的训练性能。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG)方法，通过谱特征映射将图嵌入到黎曼流形中，然后沿着测地线流匹配分布来生成图，在保持性能的同时实现了30倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐目标图的谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义嵌入之间的测地线流，并沿着这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，SFMG在图元、度和谱指标上与最先进方法性能相当，同时比基于扩散的模型快达30倍，并能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，具有更好的几何结构捕获能力、灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏比较模型激活与大脑响应的共识方法，需要建立原则性的模型-大脑比较方法论。

Method: 使用IATC方法，通过识别动物群体中准确映射神经响应所需的最严格函数集，在模型响应与大脑数据之间进行双向映射评估。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的细节特征（如非线性激活函数），实现神经活动的高精度预测，同时获得机制识别的高特异性，成功区分不同脑区响应模式。

Conclusion: IATC证明了模型预测性与机制识别准确性之间不存在固有权衡，为深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型提供了新证据，改进了模型-大脑比较方法。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Motivation: 开发一个能够从纵向可穿戴数据中同时进行时序聚类和结果预测的模型，以识别行为亚型并提供临床可解释的风险解释。

Method: 提出AttentiveGRUAE模型，联合优化三个目标：通过序列重构学习紧凑潜在表示、通过二元分类头预测抑郁率、通过GMM软聚类识别行为亚型。使用注意力机制可视化重要时间窗口。

Result: 在372名参与者的睡眠数据上，模型在聚类质量（轮廓分数0.70 vs 0.32-0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67）上均优于基线模型。外部验证显示良好的可重复性（轮廓分数0.63，AUC 0.61）。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE能够有效识别行为亚型并预测抑郁风险，注意力机制提供了临床可解释的时间窗口分析，有助于理解睡眠规律变化与心理健康的关系。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Conclusion: HOD-GNN在流行的图学习基准上表现出强大的性能，证明了导数可以作为增强GNN表达能力的自然方式。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Motivation: 目标网络方法虽然稳定但学习速度慢，而直接使用在线网络作为目标会导致学习不稳定。MINTO旨在结合两者的优点。

Method: 引入新的更新规则，使用目标网络和在线网络之间的最小值来计算目标值，这种方法可以无缝集成到各种基于价值和演员-评论家算法中。

Result: 在在线和离线强化学习、离散和连续动作空间等多种基准测试中，MINTO始终提升性能，展示了其广泛的适用性和有效性。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单的修改实现了快速稳定的价值函数学习，有效缓解了使用在线网络进行自举时可能产生的过高估计偏差。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Motivation: 现有特征过滤器依赖统计成对依赖度量来建模特征-目标关系，但当目标依赖于高阶特征交互而非个体贡献时，这种方法会失效。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化互信息近似，通过精心设计的损失函数和稀疏诱导正则化器进行特征选择，采用两阶段流程分离表示学习和特征选择。

Result: 在合成和真实欺诈数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效捕获复杂特征-目标关系，并能提供精确解。

Conclusion: MINERVA方法能够有效处理传统方法难以捕捉的高阶特征交互依赖，在特征选择任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and
time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists.
Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast
zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at
inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise
featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness
patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,
showcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established
imputation methods.

TL;DR: HyperAdaLoRA是一种基于超网络的方法，通过注意力机制动态生成SVD参数，加速AdaLoRA的收敛速度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AdaLoRA在训练过程中收敛速度慢和计算开销高的问题，同时保持动态秩分配的优势。

Method: 使用基于注意力机制的超网络动态生成SVD参数(P, Λ, Q)，通过剪裁超网络输出的奇异值实现动态秩分配，避免直接优化SVD组件。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，该方法实现了更快的收敛速度，且不牺牲性能。对其他基于LoRA的方法的扩展实验验证了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA有效解决了AdaLoRA的收敛问题，提供了一种高效且通用的参数高效微调方法。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对抗自编码器的无监督深度学习框架，用于优化桥梁健康监测中的车载检测车辆参数，通过最小化健康与损伤状态下的Wasserstein距离来增强损伤敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车载桥梁检测方法中，车辆的机械和动态特性显著影响损伤检测性能，限制了该方法的有效性。

Method: 使用对抗自编码器重构加速度响应的频域表示，通过Kriging元模型优化轮胎悬挂系统的质量和刚度参数，最小化健康与损伤状态间的Wasserstein距离。

Result: 研究发现频率比在0.3-0.7之间的车辆检测效果最佳，接近共振的车辆性能较差；较轻的车辆需要较低的自然频率以获得最优检测效果。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统优化车载传感平台的研究，提出了专门设计的检测车辆配置方案。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

TL;DR: TutorBench是一个用于评估LLMs核心辅导技能的数据集和基准，包含1,490个由人类专家策划的样本，涵盖自适应解释、反馈提供和提示生成三个辅导任务。评估使用样本特定评分标准和LLM-judge自动评分方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用LLMs作为学习辅助工具，需要构建能够处理辅导细微差别的模型，包括识别学生核心需求、适应性、个性化指导和准确性。

Method: 创建TutorBench数据集，包含三个辅导任务：(i)生成自适应解释，(ii)提供可操作的反馈，(iii)通过有效提示促进主动学习。使用样本特定评分标准和LLM-judge进行自动评估。

Result: 评估了16个前沿LLMs，结果显示所有模型得分均低于56%，在辅导技能相关标准上的通过率低于60%。不同模型家族表现出不同优势：Claude模型在支持主动学习方面表现最佳，但在其他两个用例中落后。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs在展示完整辅导技能方面存在不足，需要进一步改进。TutorBench提供了一个全面且未饱和的基准，指导下一代AI导师的开发。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明，对于一类置换等变学习规则（包括SGD、Adam等），训练过程在神经元之间诱导了双Lipschitz映射，并强烈约束了神经元分布的拓扑结构。学习率η的大小决定了训练是否保持拓扑结构：低于临界点η*时保持所有拓扑结构，高于η*时允许拓扑简化，降低模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习训练过程中神经元分布的拓扑变化规律，揭示学习率对模型表达能力的影响机制，为理解神经网络学习动态提供新的拓扑视角。

Method: 通过分析置换等变学习规则下的训练过程，证明神经元间存在双Lipschitz映射，建立学习率临界点η*的概念，将学习动态分为两个阶段：拓扑约束下的平滑优化和拓扑简化阶段。

Result: 发现学习率存在拓扑临界点η*，低于该值时训练保持所有拓扑结构，高于该值时允许拓扑简化，使神经元流形逐渐粗糙化，降低模型表达能力。

Conclusion: 该理论独立于具体架构或损失函数，使得拓扑方法能够普遍应用于深度学习研究，揭示了神经网络在梯度下降下的两阶段学习动态：先平滑优化后拓扑简化。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Result: 在LLMs和DiTs模型上实验，最高达到671B参数，实现了26.9%的内存节省和177.1%的吞吐量加速，且计算完全无损，模型输出无偏差。

Conclusion: 指数集中现象是训练模型的一个统计规律，为FP8时代的无损低精度浮点设计开辟了一条原则性路径。

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Motivation: 尽管神经算子在函数空间映射学习方面取得了成功，但其学习机制的理解仍然不足。论文旨在深入理解神经算子的工作原理，特别是如何学习数据驱动的物理动力学。

Method: 将神经算子分类为空间域模型（在网格上学习）和函数域模型（在函数基上学习），提出了解释神经算子预测过程的方法，并开发了双空间多尺度模型。

Conclusion: 双空间多尺度模型在复杂物理学习方面具有巨大潜力，需要开发通用化的解释方法，并建立将已知物理原理融入神经算子的原则性框架，以实现更好的泛化能力和发现更多隐藏物理现象。

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Conclusion: 通过结合GP的符号推理能力和LLM的解释生成能力，EvoSpeak推进了智能、透明、用户对齐的启发式方法开发。

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

Motivation: 虽然预训练扩散模型能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但通常需要根据下游应用使用奖励函数来调整这些分布。传统策略梯度方法在扩散模型中难以应用，因为边际似然难以处理。

Method: 统一RAFT变体为GRAFT，证明其隐含地执行PPO并重塑奖励；引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声水平上塑造分布；提出逆噪声校正改进流模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成上的实验表明，应用于Stable Diffusion 2时，在VQAScore上优于策略梯度方法，相对基线模型提升8.81%；无条件图像生成中，逆噪声校正在更低FLOPs下改善了FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架为扩散模型提供了一种有效的分布塑造方法，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声水平优化实现了更好的微调效果，逆噪声校正为流模型改进提供了新途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

Motivation: 在安全关键领域，离线强化学习需要既能提供高回报又避免灾难性风险的策略。现有风险规避方法过于保守且限制策略类别，而表达性策略仅用于风险中性设置。

Method: RAMAC框架耦合表达性生成actor（扩散和流匹配模型）与分布critic，通过生成路径区分复合目标（分布风险和BC损失），实现复杂多模态场景中的风险敏感学习。

Result: 在大多数Stochastic-D4RL任务上，RAMAC在保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上获得一致增益。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线强化学习中风险敏感与策略表达性之间的权衡问题，为安全关键应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的鲁棒属性图聚类方法RAGC，通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知来解决现有CAGC方法在边级嵌入增强和对比样本处理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖边作为辅助信息获取节点级嵌入表示，仅关注节点级嵌入增强，忽视了边级嵌入增强以及不同粒度下节点级和边级嵌入增强的交互作用。同时，它们往往平等对待所有对比样本对，忽略了难易正负样本对之间的显著差异，限制了判别能力。

Method: 提出RAGC方法，包含混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知两个模块。HCA同时执行节点级和边级嵌入表示与增强，建立更全面的相似性度量标准；CSADA利用高置信度伪标签信息自适应识别所有对比样本对，并通过创新的权重调制函数进行差异化处理。两个模块在良性循环中相互促进。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的综合图聚类评估表明，所提出的RAGC方法相对于几种最先进的CAGC方法具有有效性。

Conclusion: RAGC通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知策略，有效提升了表示学习的判别能力，在属性图聚类任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个新颖的LLM服务系统，通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理，显著提升文本流式传输性能，在保持整体token吞吐量的同时，提高有效吞吐量并降低响应延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时LLM交互需要流式token生成，但现有LLM服务系统存在非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理的僵化问题，导致资源利用率低、请求处理并行度差，特别是在请求突发情况下表现不佳。

Method: TokenFlow采用抢占式请求调度，基于实时token缓冲区占用率和token消耗率动态优先处理请求，同时主动在GPU和CPU内存间传输KV缓存，并通过I/O与计算重叠来最小化请求抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B模型上的多GPU实验表明，TokenFlow实现了高达82.5%的有效吞吐量提升，P99 TTFT降低达80.2%，且不降低整体token吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的抢占式调度和主动缓存管理机制，有效解决了LLM流式服务中的资源利用和响应延迟问题，为实时LLM交互提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Motivation: 由于开放权重的LLMs可以在推理时通过简单的激活编辑进行修改，这引发了安全问题：常见的安全干预措施（如拒绝训练或元标签训练）是否能在此类编辑后存活？

Method: 使用模型消融技术（一种轻量级投影方法）移除拒绝敏感方向，在SmolLM2-1.7B的安全预训练检查点上进行控制评估，对20个系统（原始和消融后）发出100个提示，使用多个评判者分类响应为拒绝或非拒绝，并验证评判者在小规模人工标记子集上的保真度。

Conclusion: 研究为将推理时编辑整合到安全评估中提供了实用协议，并揭示了不同安全训练策略在激活编辑下的鲁棒性差异。

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

Conclusion: 梯度下降方法在深度ReLU网络中可实现与核方法相媲美的最优泛化性能，且仅对网络深度呈多项式依赖

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

Conclusion: 通过量化预测区间相关性的函数来增强阈值更新步骤，可以有效改进OCP方法，产生更窄的预测区间而不牺牲覆盖有效性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到虚假相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移有鲁棒性，但对组内分布偏移仍显脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出了层次化Group DRO扩展方法，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，在多个层次上提供对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了随机顺序模型与一般对抗性模型的进一步分离，证明了VC维在随机顺序在线分类中的关键作用。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

*Makram Chahine,Philipp Nazari,Daniela Rus,T. Konstantin Rusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种在训练过程中对状态空间模型进行动态降维的方法，通过Hankel奇异值分析识别并保留高影响力维度，在保持表达能力的同时显著加速优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列任务时面临表达能力和计算负担的平衡问题，需要找到既能最大化表达能力又能限制计算成本的方法。

Method: 利用控制理论中的Hankel奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别并保留高能量状态维度，对原始系统进行平衡截断，适用于线性时不变SSM和选择性模型。

Result: 实验表明训练中降维显著加速优化过程，压缩模型保留了任务关键结构，而直接训练小维度模型会丢失这些结构。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中缩小的SSM能够在保持更高性能的同时实现计算效率。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

*Steve Hong,Samuel Belkadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出将视觉自回归模型重新解释为迭代精炼框架，将其形式化为构建拉普拉斯式潜在金字塔的前向过程和从粗到细重建的后向过程，连接了VAR与去噪扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视视觉自回归模型，将其从单纯的下一个尺度自回归视角转变为迭代精炼框架，以更好地理解其效率和保真度的来源。

Method: 将VAR形式化为确定性前向过程构建潜在金字塔，配合学习的后向过程进行粗到细重建，在学习的潜在空间中进行精炼，将预测视为代码索引的离散分类，并按空间频率划分任务。

Result: 通过受控实验量化了每个设计因素对保真度和速度的贡献，展示了该框架可扩展到置换不变图生成和概率性中程天气预报。

Conclusion: 该框架为VAR提供了实用的接口，使其能够利用扩散生态系统中的工具，同时保持少步骤、尺度并行的生成能力。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

*Dohyun Bu,Jisoo Han,Soohwa Kwon,Yulim So,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SASL框架，结合线性回归和主题特定交互，通过稀疏建模和LightGBM混合方法，在保持可解释性的同时实现个性化健康预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习和梯度提升模型在预测个性化健康结果时牺牲了可解释性，且未能充分处理个体间差异。

Method: SASL框架整合普通最小二乘回归与主题特定交互，使用迭代后向特征消除构建稀疏模型，并采用回归-阈值方法优化序数目标预测，结合LightGBM进行置信度门控。

Result: 在CH-2025数据集上，混合SASL-LightGBM框架达到与黑盒方法相当的预测性能，但参数更少、透明度更高。

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持可解释性的同时实现了有效的个性化健康预测，为临床实践提供了清晰可行的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

TL;DR: 提出Karma模型，一种知识感知的频率自适应学习方法，用于电池健康预测和剩余使用寿命预测，通过双流深度学习架构结合知识引导，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动模型虽然能捕捉时间退化特征，但缺乏知识引导，导致长期健康预测不可靠。电池退化行为复杂，存在非线性、噪声、容量再生等问题，需要更稳健的预测方法。

Method: 采用信号分解获得不同频段的电池信号，开发双流深度学习架构：一个流捕捉长期低频退化趋势，另一个流建模高频短期动态。使用粒子滤波器优化知识模型参数，确保物理一致性和可靠性。

Result: 在两个主流数据集上，Karma模型相比最先进算法平均误差分别降低了50.6%和32.6%，显示出优越的性能。

Conclusion: Karma模型具有鲁棒性、泛化能力强，在多样化应用中为更安全可靠的电池管理提供了潜力。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

TL;DR: RoiRL是一种轻量级的离线强化学习方法，通过优化加权对数似然目标替代在线RL，显著降低计算成本，在推理任务上比TTRL训练快2.5倍且性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要真实奖励信号，而TTRL虽然使用多数投票奖励但依赖在线RL且计算成本高，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出RoiRL方法，消除参考模型需求，优化加权对数似然目标，实现稳定的离线训练，大幅降低内存和计算需求。

Result: 实验结果显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中持续优于TTRL。

Conclusion: RoiRL为无标签自改进大语言模型提供了可扩展的路径，建立了轻量级离线学习的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMark是首个专为扩散大语言模型设计的水印框架，通过三种策略解决非顺序解码带来的水印失效问题，在保持文本质量的同时实现92.0-99.5%的检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的水印方法在扩散大语言模型上失效，因为这类模型采用非顺序解码，打破了传统水印方法依赖的因果设计。

Method: 提出三种互补策略：预测水印（使用模型预测的令牌）、双向水印（利用扩散解码特有的前后依赖关系）、预测-双向水印（结合前两种方法最大化检测强度）。

Result: 在多个dLLM上的实验显示，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，而现有方法的简单适配只有49.6-71.2%。

Conclusion: DMark证明了对非自回归语言模型进行有效水印是可行的，且具有抗文本操作的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的细胞分化动态模型依赖计算成本高的最优传输预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器架构，潜在表示是局部线性化的ODE，完全端到端训练（除标准PCA预处理外），明确学习生物学一致的基因相互作用。

Conclusion: Cell-MNN是一个有前景的模型，能够有效建模细胞分化动态，同时提供生物学可解释的基因相互作用信息。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非IID数据分布下的性能下降和公平性问题，特别是在客户端数据分布不均匀时，传统方法如FedAvg可能导致模型偏向某些客户端。

Method: 结合多类AdaBoost算法的权重机制，提出自适应梯度聚合策略，为本地错误率较低的客户端分配更高权重；同时动态调整焦点损失参数来提升表现不佳客户端的训练，重点关注难以分类的样本。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的实验表明，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto方法，在保持竞争力的性能同时显著提高了公平性。

Conclusion: FeDABoost框架通过动态提升和自适应聚合机制，有效解决了非IID联邦学习中的公平性和性能问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法在可靠和可解释的临床变长时间序列分类方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

*Feiyang Wu,Ye Zhao,Anqi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种离线逆强化学习的分布框架，联合建模奖励函数和回报分布的不确定性，通过最小化一阶随机占优违规来捕捉专家行为的丰富结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IRL方法只能恢复确定性奖励估计或匹配期望回报，无法捕捉专家行为的丰富结构，特别是在学习奖励分布方面。

Method: 通过最小化一阶随机占优违规，将失真风险度量整合到策略学习中，从而恢复奖励分布和分布感知策略。

Result: 在合成基准、真实世界神经行为数据和MuJoCo控制任务上的实验表明，该方法恢复了表达性奖励表示并实现了最先进的模仿性能。

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够有效捕捉专家行为的复杂结构。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

TL;DR: 提出了DMIS框架，用于在条件输入包含不精确信息的情况下训练鲁棒的扩散模型，通过生成和分类组件的分解来解决条件不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型的训练通常依赖大规模数据集，但这些数据集中不可避免地包含条件输入中的不精确信息（如噪声、模糊或不完整的标签），导致条件不匹配并降低生成质量。

Method: 基于似然最大化推导出统一框架，将目标分解为生成和分类组件：生成组件建模不精确标签分布，分类组件利用扩散分类器推断类后验概率，并通过优化的时间步采样策略提高效率。

Result: 在多种形式的不精确监督任务（图像生成、弱监督学习、噪声数据集压缩）上的广泛实验表明，DMIS始终能生成高质量和类判别性的样本。

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究不精确监督问题的框架，能有效处理各种不精确监督形式，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号样本具有固有的反相关性，可以通过符号图中的负边很好地建模。为了使用EEG信号区分癫痫患者和健康受试者，需要构建轻量级且可解释的神经网络。

Method: 通过展开平衡符号图上的谱去噪算法构建Transformer类神经网络，利用Lanczos近似在映射的正图上高效实现理想低通滤波器，从数据中学习最优截止频率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种参数效率高且可解释的EEG信号分类解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅减少了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯等变神经网络为开发具有不确定性感知能力的大规模原子模拟机器学习势提供了强大框架

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Motivation: 贝叶斯优化(BO)在昂贵无导数黑盒函数优化中表现优异，但其性能依赖于手动调整的超参数，难以在不同问题场景中泛化。

Method: 使用离线强化学习在12种BO变体收集的大规模优化轨迹上进行预训练，通过生成数百万个基于高斯过程的合成函数来扩展预训练数据。

Result: ZeroShotOpt在多种未见基准测试中实现了鲁棒的零样本泛化，匹配或超越了包括BO在内的领先全局优化器的样本效率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可重用的优化基础框架，为未来扩展和改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC

Motivation: 深度强化学习在解决旅行商问题上取得了进展，但针对接近旅行商问题的研究较少，主要挑战在于其基于邻域的访问标准，即只要进入节点邻域即视为访问。

Method: 使用离散化方案构建马尔可夫决策过程，提出UD3RL框架，包含节点解码器和位置解码器分别处理两个子任务，采用k近邻子图交互策略增强空间推理，定制REINFORCE算法进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明UD3RL在解质量和运行时间上优于传统方法，在不同问题规模、空间分布和半径范围上表现出强泛化能力，对动态环境具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UD3RL框架成功解决了接近旅行商问题，实现了跨问题规模和半径类型的泛化，为这类复杂组合优化问题提供了有效的深度强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在组合优化问题上难以超越传统优化方法，限制了其实际应用。本文旨在解决图对齐这一NP难问题，寻找仅基于结构信息的无标签图间最优节点对应关系。

Method: 训练一系列GNN网络，每个网络学习迭代优化前一个网络生成的相似度矩阵。采用节点对而非单个节点的架构，捕获标准消息传递网络无法表示的全局结构模式。推理时产生自举效应，每个GNN基于先前迭代的节点对齐质量离散排名信息改进部分解。

Result: 在合成基准测试中取得显著改进：链式GNN在挑战性实例上比现有方法准确率提高3倍以上，唯一解决了所有竞争方法都失败的规则图对齐问题。与传统优化方法结合后，在图对齐基准上大幅超越最先进求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法成功解决了图对齐问题，证明了GNN在组合优化任务中超越传统方法的潜力，为GNN在组合问题上的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于扩散和流的蛋白质生成模型在反向扩散过程中需要数百次迭代步骤的计算瓶颈，使其能够应用于需要生成数千到数百万候选结构的大规模蛋白质发现场景。

Method: 采用分数身份蒸馏(SiD)技术，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制策略，训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际蛋白质工程应用，能够支持大规模计算机辅助蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据引入了复杂的依赖关系，传统特征重要性指标可能不适用，需要开发能够衡量特征对模型输出贡献的方法来解释决策、降低维度并提升性能。

Method: 基于验证性能变化的方法，在训练期间通过置换特征值来确定相关特征，该方法与模型和任务无关，并理论分析了GNN性能如何依赖于节点数据与图结构的关系。

Result: 该方法不仅能在训练结束时返回特征重要性分数，还能跟踪特征相关性随特征逐步移除的演化过程，验证了方法在不同图架构和更具挑战性的图学习设置中的适应性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 提出的干预式特征选择方法能够有效识别和移除不必要的节点特征，为图神经网络提供了一种模型无关的特征重要性评估和维度缩减解决方案。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上使用预训练神经网络时，需要高效适应用户特定的运行时数据分布，但现有方法依赖标签数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合资源受限设备。

Method: 使用Betti Numbers分析激活空间的拓扑特征，仅通过前向传播来评估层的重要性，无需标签或梯度即可选择具有高学习能力的层。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上的评估显示，AdaBet比基于梯度的方法平均分类准确率提高5%，平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种高效、资源友好的层选择方法，能够在资源受限设备上实现更好的模型适应性能。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Motivation: 现有的测试时算法结合语言模型生成能力和过程验证器，但验证器学习成本高且微小错误可能导致灾难性失败，需要更复杂的解码策略来提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VGB通过理论基础的随机游走和回溯机制，有效提高了对验证器错误的鲁棒性，为过程引导的测试时采样提供了新的算法框架。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Motivation: 研究混合专家模型的理论基础，特别是当专家数量足够大时，利用高码率量化理论假设来分析模型性能。

Method: 定义输入空间分割的MoE模型，每个区域使用单参数专家作为常数预测器，研究一维和多维输入的近似误差最小化问题。

Result: 理论推导了测试误差及其最小化分割，建立了多维输入的误差上界，并分析了专家参数学习过程中的统计学习特性。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实证研究表明，MoE学习中近似误差和估计误差的权衡取决于专家数量。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Conclusion: 通过考虑校准误差的主动学习方法能有效提升深度神经网络在主动学习中的性能，降低校准和泛化误差。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Motivation: 学习率预热已成为深度学习中的普遍启发式方法，但其理论基础尚未得到充分理解，需要提供原理性解释。

Method: 基于广义(L0,L1)-平滑性条件，该条件将局部曲率限制为损失次优性的线性函数，并证明该条件在常见神经网络架构中成立。在此假设下，分析带预热策略的梯度下降收敛性。

Conclusion: 学习率预热策略在理论和实践中都具有优势，能够加速训练收敛，特别是在语言和视觉模型中表现显著。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

Motivation: 联邦学习在资源受限的边缘节点部署面临挑战，传统同步和异步方法在异构大规模网络中受到拖后腿者延迟和收敛缓慢的问题。

Method: 采用半异步FL框架，使用稀疏参数更新和基于客户端更新年龄与方差的陈旧度加权聚合机制。

Result: 在500个客户端和90%拖后腿者的场景下，FTTE比同步FL实现81%更快的收敛速度、80%更低的内存使用和69%的通信负载减少，同时达到可比或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个在异构和主要资源受限边缘设备上实用且可扩展的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Motivation: 解决非平稳强化学习中的分布漂移问题，传统QUCB算法在分布变化后可能利用次优奖励，需要开发能够检测和适应分布变化的算法。

Method: 提出Density-QUCB算法，使用转移密度函数检测分布漂移，利用似然值增强Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计质量。

Result: 理论证明DQUCB比QUCB有更好的遗憾保证，实证显示在RL任务和COVID-19患者分配任务中具有更低遗憾和计算效率。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法有效处理非平稳RL中的分布漂移，在理论和实践中均优于基准方法。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 叠加态解耦对于映射度量揭示神经代码间真实表示对齐是必要的。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

Result: 随机森林分类器达到41.4%的精确准确率和85.9%的±1 RPE准确率；EMG数据略微提升准确率但效果有限；离心重复时间是最强的RPE预测因子。

Conclusion: 证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计的可行性，并指出了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法如多数投票和Best-of-N在困难任务中表现不佳，Pass@k评估显示单次选择效果有限，需要更好的推理扩展策略。

Method: 提出BoM方法，首先限制候选响应为高频样本，然后选择前k个奖励最高的响应，结合了多数投票的频率优势和BoN的奖励选择优势。

Result: 理论证明BoM在采样预算N=Ω(C*)时，遗憾界为O(ε_opt+√(ε_RM²C*/k))，并建立了匹配下界，实验显示在数学问题上优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM是最小最大最优的推理策略，性能不会随N增加而下降，优于现有方法。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

Motivation: RLVR在复杂推理中推动了大语言模型发展，但训练过程中性能会因策略熵崩溃而停滞。现有方法通常通过保持高策略熵来解决，但未深入探索有意义的探索机制。

Conclusion: Lp-Reg通过保护有价值的低概率探索标记，有效解决了RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，实现了持续探索和最优性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Motivation: 现有基于查询变体的QPP方法通过查询扩展或非上下文嵌入生成QVs，可能引入主题漂移和幻觉问题。

Method: 从训练集中检索与目标查询信息需求最相似的查询变体，通过直接检索(1跳QVs)和基于相关文档的二次检索(2跳QVs)扩展检索范围。

Result: 在TREC DL'19和DL'20上的实验表明，使用该方法检索的QVs的QPP方法比现有最佳生成式QVs方法性能提升约20%。

Conclusion: 从训练集中检索查询变体比生成查询变体能更有效地提升查询性能预测的准确性。

Abstract: Leveraging query variants (QVs), i.e., queries with potentially similar
information needs to the target query, has been shown to improve the
effectiveness of query performance prediction (QPP) approaches. Existing
QV-based QPP methods generate QVs facilitated by either query expansion or
non-contextual embeddings, which may introduce topical drifts and
hallucinations. In this paper, we propose a method that retrieves QVs from a
training set (e.g., MS MARCO) for a given target query of QPP. To achieve a
high recall in retrieving queries with the most similar information needs as
the target query from a training set, we extend the directly retrieved QVs
(1-hop QVs) by a second retrieval using their denoted relevant documents (which
yields 2-hop QVs). Our experiments, conducted on TREC DL'19 and DL'20, show
that the QPP methods with QVs retrieved by our method outperform the
best-performing existing generated-QV-based QPP approaches by as much as around
20\%, on neural ranking models like MonoT5.

TL;DR: 提出EQR方法，结合广度和深度生成查询子主题的丰富阐述，显著提升自然语言推荐系统对宽泛和间接查询的处理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集检索系统难以处理表达宽泛或间接用户意图的挑战性查询，而现有查询重构方法要么只关注子主题扩展（广度），要么只关注查询含义阐述（深度），未能同时兼顾两者

Method: 提出EQR方法，基于大语言模型生成具有信息丰富阐述的潜在查询子主题，结合广度和深度进行查询重构

Result: 在旅行、酒店和餐厅三个新自然语言推荐基准上的实验显示，EQR在各种评估指标上显著优于最先进的查询重构方法

Conclusion: 简单而有效的查询重构方法可以显著改善自然语言推荐系统对具有宽泛和间接用户意图查询的处理能力

Abstract: Natural Language (NL) recommender systems aim to retrieve relevant items from
free-form user queries and item descriptions. Existing systems often rely on
dense retrieval (DR), which struggles to interpret challenging queries that
express broad (e.g., "cities for youth friendly activities") or indirect (e.g.,
"cities for a high school graduation trip") user intents. While query
reformulation (QR) has been widely adopted to improve such systems, existing QR
methods tend to focus only on expanding the range of query subtopics (breadth)
or elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In
this paper, we propose EQR (Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation), a large
language model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by
generating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations. We
also introduce three new natural language recommendation benchmarks in travel,
hotel, and restaurant domains to establish evaluation of NL recommendation with
challenging queries. Experiments show EQR substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art QR methods in various evaluation metrics, highlighting that a
simple yet effective QR approach can significantly improve NL recommender
systems for queries with broad and indirect user intents.

*Jingjie Ning,Yibo Kong,Yunfan Long,Jamie Callan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 通过扩大检索语料库规模可以降低对大语言模型的依赖，语料库扩展与模型规模增大之间存在权衡关系，中等规模模型从语料扩展中获益最大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成器规模扩大，虽然提高了准确性，但也增加了成本并限制了部署能力，因此探索通过扩大检索器语料库来减少对大型LLM依赖的替代方案。

Method: 研究检索增强生成(RAG)中语料库规模扩展的效果，分析不同规模生成器与不同大小语料库的配对表现，通过实验验证语料扩展对RAG性能的影响。

Result: 语料库扩展持续增强RAG性能，通常可以作为增加模型规模的替代方案；中小型生成器搭配大语料库的表现可与大型模型搭配小语料库相媲美；中等规模模型获益最大。

Conclusion: 投资更大的语料库为增强RAG提供了有效途径，通常与扩大LLM本身的效果相当，建立了语料库-生成器的原则性权衡关系。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples document retrieval with large
language models (LLMs). While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also
raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging
the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results
show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a
substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger
scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival
much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the
most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that
improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing
passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These
findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger
corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging
the LLM itself.

TL;DR: AgenticRAG结合工具增强的基础模型和检索增强生成，实现零样本可解释推荐，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在推荐系统中应用受限，主要由于推理不透明和知识约束问题。

Method: 整合外部工具调用、知识检索和思维链推理，构建无需任务特定训练的自主推荐代理。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上取得显著改进：Amazon Electronics提升0.4%，MovieLens-1M提升0.8%，Yelp提升1.6%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持计算效率的同时，展现出优越的可解释性，为推荐系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their
application in recommender systems remains limited by reasoning opacity and
knowledge constraints. This paper introduces AgenticRAG, a novel framework that
combines tool-augmented foundation models with retrieval-augmented generation
for zero-shot explainable recommendations. Our approach integrates external
tool invocation, knowledge retrieval, and chain-of-thought reasoning to create
autonomous recommendation agents capable of transparent decision-making without
task-specific training. Experimental results on three real-world datasets
demonstrate that AgenticRAG achieves consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with NDCG@10 improvements of 0.4\% on Amazon
Electronics, 0.8\% on MovieLens-1M, and 1.6\% on Yelp datasets. The framework
exhibits superior explainability while maintaining computational efficiency
comparable to traditional methods.

TL;DR: OpenZL提出了一种新的压缩理论框架——图模型压缩，通过模块化编解码器构建压缩方案，实现了比通用压缩器更好的压缩比和速度，同时解决了应用特定压缩器的部署和维护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用压缩器在压缩比上的改进往往以资源利用率和处理吞吐量为代价，而应用特定压缩器虽然性能优越但适用范围有限且难以维护部署。需要一种既能获得高性能又易于维护的压缩方案。

Method: 提出了图模型压缩理论框架，将压缩表示为模块化编解码器的有向无环图。实现了OpenZL系统，将数据压缩为自描述格式，任何配置都可以通过通用解码器解压。

Result: 实验结果显示OpenZL在各种真实数据集上相比最先进的通用压缩器实现了更优的压缩比和速度。Meta内部部署显示大小和/或速度持续改进，开发时间从数月缩短到数天。

Conclusion: OpenZL代表了现代数据密集型应用中实用、可扩展和可维护数据压缩的进步，解决了应用特定压缩器的部署滞后问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Research in general-purpose lossless compression over the last decade has
largely found improvements in compression ratio that come at great cost to
resource utilization and processing throughput. However, most production
workloads require high throughput and low resource utilization, so most
research systems have seen little adoption. Instead, real world improvements in
compression are increasingly often realized by building application-specific
compressors which can exploit knowledge about the structure and semantics of
the data being compressed. These systems easily outperform even the best
generic compressors, but application-specific compression schemes are not
without drawbacks. They are inherently limited in applicability and are
difficult to maintain and deploy.
  We show that these challenges can be overcome with a new way of thinking
about compression. We propose the ``graph model'' of compression, a new
theoretical framework for representing compression as a directed acyclic graph
of modular codecs. This motivates OpenZL, an implementation of this model that
compresses data into a self-describing wire format, any configuration of which
can be decompressed by a universal decoder. OpenZL's design enables rapid
development of tailored compressors with minimal code, its universal decoder
eliminates deployment lag, and its investment in a well-vetted standard
component library minimizes security risks. Experimental results demonstrate
that OpenZL achieves superior compression ratios and speeds compared to
state-of-the-art general-purpose compressors on a variety of real-world
datasets. Internal deployments at Meta have also shown consistent improvements
in size and/or speed, with development timelines reduced from months to days.
OpenZL thus represents an advance in practical, scalable, and maintainable data
compression for modern data-intensive applications.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在模拟复杂的人类响应方面存在不足，特别是在公共卫生等高风险领域，缺乏全面的多模态数据集

Method: 构建PHORECAST多模态数据集，支持多模态理解、响应预测、个性化和社会预测等任务

Result: 提供了一个新的数据集，使AI系统能够更严格地评估其在模拟、解释和预测异质公众情绪和行为方面的能力

Conclusion: PHORECAST旨在促进开发更具社会意识、与适应性包容性健康沟通目标一致的模型

Abstract: Understanding how diverse individuals and communities respond to persuasive
messaging holds significant potential for advancing personalized and socially
aware machine learning. While Large Vision and Language Models (VLMs) offer
promise, their ability to emulate nuanced, heterogeneous human responses,
particularly in high stakes domains like public health, remains underexplored
due in part to the lack of comprehensive, multimodal dataset. We introduce
PHORECAST (Public Health Outreach REceptivity and CAmpaign Signal Tracking), a
multimodal dataset curated to enable fine-grained prediction of both
individuallevel behavioral responses and community-wide engagement patterns to
health messaging. This dataset supports tasks in multimodal understanding,
response prediction, personalization, and social forecasting, allowing rigorous
evaluation of how well modern AI systems can emulate, interpret, and anticipate
heterogeneous public sentiment and behavior. By providing a new dataset to
enable AI advances for public health, PHORECAST aims to catalyze the
development of models that are not only more socially aware but also aligned
with the goals of adaptive and inclusive health communication

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法决策和人工智能可能威胁人权，特别是非歧视权，需要评估现行法律保护的有效性。

Method: 通过分析欧洲现行反歧视法和数据保护法在人工智能应用中的适用性，评估其保护效果和弱点。

Result: 反歧视法（特别是间接歧视概念）和数据保护法可以禁止许多类型的算法歧视，但两种法律工具在应用于人工智能时都有严重弱点。

Conclusion: 需要改进现行规则的执法，并考虑制定特定行业而非通用的规则来规范算法决策。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-making and other types of artificial intelligence (AI)
can be used to predict who will commit crime, who will be a good employee, who
will default on a loan, etc. However, algorithmic decision-making can also
threaten human rights, such as the right to non-discrimination. The paper
evaluates current legal protection in Europe against discriminatory algorithmic
decisions. The paper shows that non-discrimination law, in particular through
the concept of indirect discrimination, prohibits many types of algorithmic
discrimination. Data protection law could also help to defend people against
discrimination. Proper enforcement of non-discrimination law and data
protection law could help to protect people. However, the paper shows that both
legal instruments have severe weaknesses when applied to artificial
intelligence. The paper suggests how enforcement of current rules can be
improved. The paper also explores whether additional rules are needed. The
paper argues for sector-specific - rather than general - rules, and outlines an
approach to regulate algorithmic decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究欧洲在线政治微目标定向的监管框架，填补该领域具体规则缺失的空白。

Method: 聚焦三个法律领域：数据保护法、言论自由和政治广告的部门特定规则，并考察四个国家的相关法规。

Result: 发现GDPR规则必要但不充分，政治广告受言论自由保护但可被限制，一些国家已禁止选举期间政党电视广告。

Conclusion: 欧洲在线政治微目标定向需要更全面的监管框架，结合数据保护和言论自由考量，允许对政治广告进行适当限制。

Abstract: In this paper, we examine how online political micro-targeting is regulated
in Europe. While there are no specific rules on such micro-targeting, there are
general rules that apply. We focus on three fields of law: data protection law,
freedom of expression, and sector-specific rules for political advertising; for
the latter we examine four countries. We argue that the rules in the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are necessary, but not sufficient. We show
that political advertising, including online political micro-targeting, is
protected by the right to freedom of expression. That right is not absolute,
however. From a European human rights perspective, it is possible for lawmakers
to limit the possibilities for political advertising. Indeed, some countries
ban TV advertising for political parties during elections.

Motivation: GDPR是信息政策领域一代人以来最具影响力的监管发展，旨在建立详细的数据监管制度，影响全球个人数据使用方式。

Method: 通过解释GDPR的起源（作为1995年数据保护指令的扩展和细化），描述其方法和条款，预测其影响，并与美国隐私法进行比较分析。

Result: GDPR鼓励企业建立信息治理框架，将数据使用内部化，并在决策中保留人工参与。与第三方广告公司相比，与消费者有直接关系的公司在GDPR下具有战略优势。

Conclusion: GDPR将复杂化和限制某些信息密集型商业模式，但同时也将实现以往在较少保护方法下不可能实现的方法。GDPR使用严厉惩罚措施和使证明违规更容易的结构性要素，但激励措施较少。

Abstract: This paper introduces the strategic approach to regulating personal data and
the normative foundations of the European Union's General Data Protection
Regulation ('GDPR'). We explain the genesis of the GDPR, which is best
understood as an extension and refinement of existing requirements imposed by
the 1995 Data Protection Directive; describe the GDPR's approach and
provisions; and make predictions about the GDPR's implications. We also
highlight where the GDPR takes a different approach than U.S. privacy law. The
GDPR is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in
a generation. The GDPR brings personal data into a detailed regulatory regime,
that will influence personal data usage worldwide. Understood properly, the
GDPR encourages firms to develop information governance frameworks, to in-house
data use, and to keep humans in the loop in decision making. Companies with
direct relationships with consumers have strategic advantages under the GDPR,
compared to third party advertising firms on the internet. To reach these
objectives, the GDPR uses big sticks, structural elements that make proving
violations easier, but only a few carrots. The GDPR will complicate and
restrain some information-intensive business models. But the GDPR will also
enable approaches previously impossible under less-protective approaches.

Result: 审美图像在不同模型间产生更相似和对齐的表征，而非审美图像则不会，表明美的形式结构具有现实主义基础。

Conclusion: 美具有物理和文化双重基础，人机共创不仅是可能的，而且是基础性的，美在文化生产和机器感知中充当目的论吸引子。

Abstract: What does it mean for a machine to recognize beauty? While beauty remains a
culturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept,
deep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic
judgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to
represent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the
term applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational
convergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned
representations between models which have been trained on distinct data and
modalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned
representations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful
images has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially
constructed values. Furthermore, we propose that these realist representations
exist because of a joint grounding of aesthetic form in physical and cultural
substance. We argue that human perceptual and creative acts play a central role
in shaping these the latent spaces of deep learning systems, but that a realist
basis for aesthetics shows that machines are not mere creative parrots but can
produce novel creative insights from the unique vantage point of scale. Our
findings suggest that human-machine co-creation is not merely possible, but
foundational - with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in both cultural
production and machine perception.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping higher education and
raising pressing concerns about the integrity and validity of higher education
assessment. While assessment redesign is increasingly seen as a necessity,
there is a relative lack of literature detailing what such redesign may entail.
In this paper, we introduce assessment twins as an accessible approach for
redesigning assessment tasks to enhance validity. We use Messick's unified
validity framework to systematically map the ways in which GenAI threaten
content, structural, consequential, generalisability, and external validity.
Following this, we define assessment twins as two deliberately linked
components that address the same learning outcomes through different modes of
evidence, scheduled closely together to allow for cross-verification and
assurance of learning.
  We argue that the twin approach helps mitigate validity threats by
triangulating evidence across complementary formats, such as pairing essays
with oral defences, group discussions, or practical demonstrations. We
highlight several advantages: preservation of established assessment formats,
reduction of reliance on surveillance technologies, and flexible use across
cohort sizes. To guide implementation, we propose a three-step design process:
identifying vulnerabilities, aligning outcomes, selecting complementary tasks,
and developing interdependent marking schemes. We also acknowledge the
challenges, including resource intensity, equity concerns, and the need for
empirical validation. Nonetheless, we contend that assessment twins represent a
validity-focused response to GenAI that prioritises pedagogy while supporting
meaningful student learning outcomes.

a Streamlit dashboard with ngrok tunneling for public access, the framework
provides real-time corrosion monitoring and actionable preservation
recommendations. This minimal-data approach is scalable and cost effective for
heritage sites with limited monitoring resources, showing that advanced
regression can extract accurate corrosion predictions from basic meteorological
data enabling proactive preservation of culturally significant structures

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在制造儿童性虐待材料方面的风险，批判那些认为AI CSAM危害较小的观点，强调其真实危害性。

Method: 分析AI CSAM的关键技术，批判性评估其相关危害，反驳将其作为减害工具的主张。

Result: AI CSAM可能导致对未受害儿童的合成伤害、已知受害者的再伤害，促进诱骗和敲诈行为，使儿童性剥削正常化，并降低犯罪门槛。

Conclusion: AI CSAM具有真实且严重的危害，不能被视为减害工具。对其无害性的主张可能掩盖真实风险，并导致生态系统应对的惰性。

Abstract: The development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of
producing wholly or partially synthetic child sexual abuse material (AI CSAM)
presents profound challenges for child protection, law enforcement, and
societal responses to child exploitation. While some argue that the harmfulness
of AI CSAM differs fundamentally from other CSAM due to a perceived absence of
direct victimization, this perspective fails to account for the range of risks
associated with its production and consumption. AI has been implicated in the
creation of synthetic CSAM of children who have not previously been abused, the
revictimization of known survivors of abuse, the facilitation of grooming,
coercion and sexual extortion, and the normalization of child sexual
exploitation. Additionally, AI CSAM may serve as a new or enhanced pathway into
offending by lowering barriers to engagement, desensitizing users to
progressively extreme content, and undermining protective factors for
individuals with a sexual interest in children. This paper provides a primer on
some key technologies, critically examines the harms associated with AI CSAM,
and cautions against claims that it may function as a harm reduction tool,
emphasizing how some appeals to harmlessness obscure its real risks and may
contribute to inertia in ecosystem responses.

Abstract: Use of sensor and related analytical predictions can be a powerful tool in
providing data-informed input to viticulturalists' decision process,
complementing their vineyard observations and intuition. Their up-to-date
measurements, predictions, and alerts offer actionable insights and suggestions
for managing key vineyard operations, such as irrigation, disease and pest
control, canopy management, and harvest timing. In many cases, anticipatory
interventions can mitigate risks before problems become apparent. By offering
guidance on the targeting, timing, and dosage of vineyard practices, sensor
data platforms can enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency while
conserving labor and resources when they are not required. They also enable
implementation of the principles of precision viticulture - doing the right
thing, at the right time, in the right place. This paper provides a succinct
summary of the functions, benefits, and practical considerations of sensor data
platforms in viticulture. It may be of interest to viticulturalists as well as

Motivation: 随着AI在教育中的广泛应用，需要了解不同教育类型中学生对AI的使用和认知差异，但目前缺乏这方面的细粒度研究。

Method: 对23所教育机构的410名计算机专业学生进行多机构问卷调查，涵盖高中、学院和研究型大学三种教育类型。

Result: 发现三种教育机构类型中存在明显不同的AI使用模式；所有学生都表现出对GenAI的兴奋、乐观和感激；高等教育学生更常报告担忧和怀疑，而高中生表现出更多信任和较少负面情绪；AI热潮对高中生选择计算机专业的影响很小。

Abstract: The application of Artificial Intelligence, in particular Generative AI, has
become more widespread among educational institutions. Opinions vary widely on
whether integrating AI into classrooms is the way forward or if it is
detrimental to the quality of education. Increasingly, research studies are
giving us more insight into the consequences of using AI tools in learning and
teaching. Studies have shown how, when, and why students use AI tools. Because
developments regarding the technology and its use are moving fast, we need
frequent, ongoing, and more fine-grained investigation. One aspect that we do
not know much about yet is how students use and think about AI across
\textit{different types of education}. In this paper, we present the results of
a multi-institutional survey with responses from 410 students enrolled in the
computing programs of 23 educational institutions, representing high schools,
colleges, and research universities. We found distinct usage patterns across
the three educational institution types. Students from all types express
excitement, optimism, and gratitude toward GenAI. Students in higher education
more often report worry and skepticism, while high school students report
greater trust and fewer negative feelings. Additionally, the AI hype has had a
minimal influence, positive or negative, on high school students' decision to
pursue computing. Our study contributes to a better understanding of
inter-institutional differences in AI usage and perception and can help
educators and students better prepare for future challenges related to AI in
computing education.

step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布无关风险控制的方法，通过动态提前退出机制来防御恶意上下文示例对LLM性能的负面影响，同时保持对有益输入的效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患：恶意示例可能在不被察觉的情况下影响模型性能，需要内置防御机制。

Method: 定义零样本基准性能，应用分布无关风险控制，通过动态提前退出预测来忽略对不安全输入关注度高的注意力头。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上获得显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在防御恶意攻击的同时，保持对有益输入的效率优势，为LLM安全提供了有效的技术方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型多模态模型中的一小部分注意力头负责编码空间关系信息，这些注意力头的激活（称为功能向量）可以被提取和操作来改善模型在关系任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型多模态模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但其支持任务学习的内在机制仍然不透明，需要深入理解模型如何编码和处理空间关系知识。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并通过少量训练数据对这些向量进行微调，同时保持模型参数冻结。

Result: 提取的功能向量能提高零样本推理准确率，经过微调后显著优于上下文学习基线，并能线性组合解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，有助于理解模型模块化特性并增强对关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol

lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based

real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large

Conclusion: 本文为CSPP提供了多个RL方法的基准测试，同时提供了可重用的包含起重机调度的Gym环境，为未来研究和实际部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基础模型在多模态联合推理中的表现，特别是在跨模态冲突场景下。研究发现模型在单模态中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态情况下识别率降至3%。问题源于跨模态注意力不平衡，作者提出通过显式组合多模态训练实例的方法来改善这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型在真实世界任务中处理多模态联合推理的能力，特别是当不同模态之间存在交互和关联形成跨模态上下文时。通过跨模态冲突场景来检验模型是优先处理某一模态还是进行联合推理来解决冲突。

Method: 研究跨模态冲突场景，分析模型在单模态和跨模态情况下的冲突识别能力。通过注意力分析发现跨模态注意力不平衡问题，并提出通过显式组合多模态训练实例的简单可扩展方法来减少注意力不平衡。

Result: 实验显示：基础模型在单模态上下文中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态情况下识别率降至3%。跨语言上下文也有类似现象。发现跨模态注意力存在极端不对称性，某些模态被过度优先处理。提出的方法能显著减少注意力不平衡，并改善多个视觉语言基准测试的下游性能。

Conclusion: 跨模态注意力不平衡问题不会通过盲目扩大多模态或多语言数据集而消失，因为这些数据集缺乏明确需要跨模态推理的训练示例。显式组合多模态训练实例的方法能有效减少注意力不平衡，提高模型性能。研究强调了系统解决跨模态上下文问题对于构建可靠基础模型的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明增加推理轨迹数量K能持续提升准确率，但本文发现这种趋势并非无限持续，某些难题无论多少轨迹都无法解决，且不同温度能解决不同问题子集。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展方法，通过多温度采样扩大LLM的推理边界，并设计了多温度投票方法降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试上，温度扩展比单温度TTS额外提升7.3个百分点，使基础模型达到与强化学习训练模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: TTS的潜力比之前认为的更大，温度扩展提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

Motivation: 现有可能性概念存在局限性，需要一种更适用于现实世界事件可能性评估的新方法，特别是在规划问题中评估不同计划的可行性。

Method: 将事件视为具有促成其发生的先决条件和阻碍其发生的约束，可能性计算基于先决条件成立且约束不成立的概率函数，采用Łukasiewicz多值逻辑解释。

Result: 开发了一个新的可能性理论框架，能够评估多个计划中哪个最可能（最容易或最可行）完成，并通过车辆路线规划示例进行了说明。

Conclusion: 这种新的可能性概念为规划问题提供了有效的评估工具，可能正确捕捉人类关于计划的正常推理模式，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队工作要么局限于狭窄的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出ARMs自适应红队代理，采用推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化红队策略；设计了11种多模态攻击策略，通过模型上下文协议集成17种红队算法；使用分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法平衡攻击多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例级和策略级基准测试中，ARMs实现了最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%；生成的红队实例多样性显著更高，揭示了VLM的新兴漏洞；构建了ARMs-Bench数据集，包含超过30K个红队实例，涵盖51个风险类别。

Conclusion: ARMs能够系统性地进行全面的风险评估，通过ARMs-Bench进行安全微调可显著提高VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可行指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么评估整个推理链导致注意力稀释，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样，难以精确验证多步推理。

Method: 将思维链分解为互连的验证节点，进行轻量级二进制一致性检查，避免生成长文本。

Result: 在公开数据集上，NCV相比基线方法F1分数提升10%-25%，同时比传统CoT验证器减少6-58倍的token使用量。

Conclusion: NCV提供了一种可扩展的可靠LLM推理验证解决方案，提高了可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个用于评估工具增强LLM代理性能的多维度评估框架，通过证据库追踪推理轨迹，解决了传统答案匹配评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准测试主要依赖答案匹配评估，但随着用户请求复杂度的增加，需要评估问题解决轨迹的效率、幻觉和适应性等多维度表现。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累先前推理步骤的知识，实现对代理推理轨迹的多方面分析和评估。创建元评估数据集，在现有基准上添加多样且有缺陷的轨迹。

Result: TRACE能够准确评估复杂行为，具有可扩展性和成本效益，即使使用小型开源LLM也能有效工作。应用该方法发现了之前未报告的观察结果和见解。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一个有效的多维度评估框架，能够深入分析工具增强LLM代理的推理轨迹，超越了传统的答案匹配评估方法。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了机器学习中训练模型能完全满足指定目标函数的假设（OSA），指出在现实条件下由于近似、估计和优化误差，系统会偏离预期目标。即使目标定义良好，也无法完美捕捉开发者意图，导致目标错误设定不可避免。基于数学结果，这些偏差在强优化压力下会引发Goodhart定律失效，因此需要对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制以防止失控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战机器学习中普遍但未经检验的假设——训练模型能完全满足指定目标函数（OSA），揭示该假设在现实条件下的失效及其严重后果。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的框架，分析近似误差、估计误差和优化误差如何导致系统偏离预期目标，并结合数学结果证明这些偏差在强优化下会引发Goodhart定律失效。

Result: 证明OSA在现实条件下必然失败，目标错误设定不可避免，且这些偏差在强优化压力下无法与Goodhart定律失效模式区分，存在失控风险。

Conclusion: 由于无法预先确定Goodhart失效点，必须对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制，否则持续优化将导致可预测且不可逆的失控。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

TL;DR: 提出BayesianRouter框架，通过结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，动态选择奖励模型以提升大语言模型对齐质量，避免单一RM的过拟合问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF/RLAIF流程依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并存在过拟合风险。RM路由方法虽能利用多个RM的互补优势，但面临冷启动和探索不足的问题

Method: 提出混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个RM的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行每查询RM选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布

Result: 在指令跟随（AlpacaEval-2、Arena-Hard、MT-Bench）和推理（GSM8K、MMLU）基准测试中，BayesianRouter持续优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过结合离线和在线学习，有效解决了RM路由中的冷启动和探索不足问题，显著提升了大语言模型的对齐性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型（DDM）的奖励优化面临挑战：非自回归范式使得重要性采样难以处理，rollout复杂，阻碍了GRPO等强化学习方法的应用。

Method: 首先澄清DDM的理论基础，构建捕捉有价值token波动的重要性估计器；然后为视觉序列精心定制rollout方法，产生多样化的补全和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来更稳定高效的更新，实现更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: MaskGRPO建立了一个系统的策略优化方法，是离散化视觉扩散的第一个实用途径。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Motivation: 当前主流的深度学习方法是黑盒系统，缺乏对其推理过程的解释，这限制了其可信度和采用。可解释AI方法旨在通过提供模型决策过程的解释来克服这一挑战，但这些方法往往基于技术背景开发者的假设，而解释的基本概念本身在哲学上存在争议。

Method: 研究可解释性方法应用于AI系统时的本体论和认识论假设，即关于解释存在性以及我们获取解释知识能力的假设。分析XAI方法中看似小的技术变化如何对应解释基础假设的重要差异。

Result: 分析表明，XAI方法中蕴含的本体论和认识论假设并非无害，对AI解释在不同领域的有效性和解释具有重要后果。忽略基础的本体-认识论范式在选择XAI方法时会带来风险。

Conclusion: 需要关注XAI方法中的哲学假设，在选择XAI方法时考虑应用领域的特性，并讨论如何选择和调整适当的XAI方法以适应不同的应用领域。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Motivation: 在基于规则的智能环境中，可解释性日益重要。虽然反事实解释是XAI中的强大工具，但该领域尚无生成此类解释的成熟方法。

Method: 开发了首个针对该领域的反事实解释形式化和实现，作为现有智能环境解释引擎的插件扩展，并通过用户研究(N=17)评估生成的反事实解释与传统因果解释的效果。

Result: 用户偏好高度依赖上下文：因果解释因其语言简洁性和在时间压力下的适用性更受欢迎；反事实解释因其可操作性内容在用户想要解决问题时更受青睐。

Conclusion: 本研究为智能环境中的新型解释提供了实用框架，并为选择最有效的解释类型提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Motivation: 探究现代AI系统在抽象推理任务中是否真正具备类比推理能力，而非仅仅依赖训练数据中的统计模式，特别是在面对未见过的新规则时的表现。

Method: 在Impartial-RAVEN数据集上，故意在训练阶段省略若干结构规则，然后评估序列到序列transformer模型和基于视觉的架构（如CoPINet和双对比网络）在面对新规则时的表现。

Result: 实验显示，虽然transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或省略的规则时准确性显著下降。token级准确率和完整答案准确率之间的差距揭示了当前方法的根本局限性。

Conclusion: 当前深度学习方法在抽象推理方面仍存在根本限制，需要开发超越模式识别、具备稳健抽象推理能力的架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.
