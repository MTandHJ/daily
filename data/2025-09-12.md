*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2是一个统一的多模态检索模型，支持图像和文本组成的多模态查询，并在多模态文档集合中进行检索，通过循环Transformer架构和LSTM门控机制实现跨层和跨模态的信息动态整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态检索在LLMs和多模态LLMs中的快速发展，出现了越来越复杂的检索任务。现有方法主要依赖于视觉-语言模型的任务特定微调，且仅限于单模态查询或文档，无法满足多模态检索的需求。

Method: ReT-2采用多层表示和循环Transformer架构，结合LSTM启发的门控机制，动态整合跨层和跨模态的信息，捕捉细粒度的视觉和文本细节。

Result: 在M2KR和M-BEIR基准测试中，ReT-2在不同检索配置下均实现了最先进的性能，同时提供更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。在检索增强生成管道中集成ReT-2还能提升Encyclopedic-VQA和InfoSeek数据集的下游性能。

Conclusion: ReT-2是一个高效统一的多模态检索模型，能够处理复杂的多模态检索任务，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法，为多模态检索领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过视觉流散模型特征和变换器聚合，实现了在动物种类、视角和上下文情境下的人类级别动作识别绝绝性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别同样动作而不受种类、视角和上下文差异影响，但现有深度学习模型在这种泛化能力上存在困难

Method: 使用视觉流散模型(VDM)生成的特征，通过变换器进行聚合，并采用基于流散过程更早时间步的模型来强调语义信息而非像素级细节

Result: 在动物种类、视角和录制上下文三个泛化测试集上均达到最佳性能，设立了新的状态名上结果

Conclusion: 该方法提升了机器动作识别的泛化能力，让机器识别更接近人类级别的稳健性

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

### [3] [PromptGuard: An Orchestrated Prompting Framework for Principled Synthetic Text Generation for Vulnerable Populations using LLMs with Enhanced Safety, Fairness, and Controllability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08910)
*Tung Vu,Lam Nguyen,Quynh Dao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个模块化提示框架，通过VulnGuard Prompt技术使用对比学习防止LLM生成有害信息，为特定人群提供保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法依赖事后过滤或通用对齐技术，无法在生成源头主动防止对弱势群体（如LGBTQ+、单亲家庭、边缘化社区）产生有害、偏见或误导性信息。

Method: 提出PromptGuard框架，包含VulnGuard Prompt混合技术：整合GitHub精选仓库的少样本示例、伦理思维链推理和自适应角色提示，采用多目标优化理论，包含六个核心模块。

Result: 通过熵界和帕累托最优性证明可减少25-30%的分析性危害，提供数学形式化包括收敛证明、信息论漏洞分析和理论验证框架。

Conclusion: PromptGuard建立了系统实证研究的数学基础，为实时危害预防创建了智能专家系统。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [4] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Beta-SOD方法，使用Beta混合分布模型检测标签噪声，在行人重识别和车辆重识别任务中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标重识别方法对标签噪声高度敏感，会导致性能显著下降，需要有效的噪声处理方案

Method: 将Re-ID重构为监督图像相似性任务，采用孪生网络架构，提出Beta-SOD统计异常检测框架，使用双分量Beta分布混合模型建模嵌入对之间的余弦相似度分布

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在各种噪声水平(10-30%)下均优于最先进方法

Conclusion: Beta-SOD方法在噪声Re-ID场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性和广泛的适用性

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

### [5] [SFD-Mamba2Net: Strcture-Guided Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Stream Mamba2 Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08934)
*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net是一个端到端的框架，通过整合多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，显著提高了ICA图像中冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为诊断金标准需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像存在低对比度、高噪声和复杂细粒度血管结构等挑战，限制了现有方法的临床应用。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块(CASE)来突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块(PHFP)，使用多级小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: SFD-Mamba2Net在八个分割指标上均优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构增强和频域细节处理的创新结合，有效解决了ICA图像分析中的关键挑战，为CAD诊断提供了更准确的自动化工具。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于MRI的自动化桌面系统，通过SAMONAI分割算法和SurvAMINN生存分析模型，显著提高直肠癌肝转移症手术预后预测准确度，C指数提升10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直肠癌肝转移症病人预后差异较大，现有预测模型预测能力不足，特别是多发性病例中

Method: 开发了包含分割管道和影像组学管道的自动化桌面系统：1) 利用基础模型完善部分标注数据 2) 提出SAMONAI算法实现单点提示3D分割 3) 使用SurvAMINN自动编码器网络进行生存分析

Result: 在227名病人的机构数据集上，该桌面系统显著超越现有临床和基因标记物，C指数提高超10%以上

Conclusion: 集成自动化分割算法和影像组学生存分析可以为CRLM提供准确、标注效率高且可解释的结果预测

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon是一个进化搜索算法，用于发现不同文本到图像生成模型之间的视觉表示差异，识别哪些视觉属性在一个模型中更常见，以及触发这些差异的提示概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型学习到的视觉表示在何时以及如何出现分歧，发现模型间的视觉属性差异及其触发条件。

Method: 引入CompCon进化搜索算法，通过自动化数据生成管道创建ID2数据集，比较不同文本到图像模型的输出差异。

Result: 成功发现了模型间的视觉表示差异，如PixArt在处理孤独相关提示时产生湿滑街道，Stable Diffusion 3.5在描绘非裔美国人媒体职业时的特定表现。

Conclusion: CompCon能有效识别生成模型间的视觉表示差异，为理解模型偏差和特征学习提供了新工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

*Yibin Wang,Wondimagegn Beshah,Padmanava Dash,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于U-Net的深度学习方法来识别和修复无人机图像中的云影和太阳耀斑，提高水质参数估计的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像在云层条件下拍摄时经常受到云影和太阳耀斑的影响，这严重影响了从图像中估计水质参数的准确性

Result: 开发出高质量图像校正模型，能够有效恢复受云影和太阳耀斑影响的图像区域

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了无人机图像中云影和太阳耀斑的问题，为水质监测等遥感应用提供了更可靠的数据基础

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种融合卷积局部特征学习和Transformer全局注意力机制的新型视觉Transformer架构，通过在每个注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，在小规模图像分类任务上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在计算机视觉中表现出色，但过于关注全局上下文而忽略了局部特征提取，特别是在小数据集上缺乏局部性和平移等变性等关键归纳偏置，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，将分层移位窗口注意力与局部卷积特征学习相结合，在每个注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，使模型能够同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet等多个图像分类基准测试中，CoSwin相比最先进的卷积和基于Transformer的模型均取得一致性能提升，特别是在CIFAR-100上提升4.92%，Tiny ImageNet上提升4.47%。

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，证明了结合卷积局部性和Transformer全局建模的优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习预测几何一致的置信矩阵，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，需要开发一个能够同时考虑局部和全局一致性的完全可微框架，以提高配准精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 首先使用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，然后通过双向源-目标和目标-源匹配的重新定位步骤进行细化，最后通过全局几何一致性学习堆叠配对点特征来预测点对点匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到95%-97%的inlier比率，KITTI-360上94%-97%，3DMatch上最高81.1%，在室外和室内数据集以及6-DoF姿态估计和部分匹配任务中都表现出色。

Conclusion: iMatcher通过完全可微的框架有效整合了局部和全局几何一致性，在各种点云配准场景中实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

*Magdalena Wysocki,Felix Duelmer,Ananya Bal,Nassir Navab,Mohammad Farid Azampour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UltrON方法，利用超声B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化，改进3D形状重建，解决遮挡和标注依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐式表示方法依赖精确标注且难以处理超声图像的视角依赖性和声学阴影伪影，需要利用B模式图像中的丰富声学信息来改进重建质量

Method: 采用基于占用率的表示方法，提出UltrON框架，利用B模式图像的声学特征，设计新颖的损失函数补偿视角依赖性，实现多视角超声的弱监督优化

Result: UltrON能够缓解遮挡和稀疏标注的限制，提高几何一致性，并能泛化到相同解剖结构的不同形状

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确的3D重建铺平了道路，代码和数据集将开源提供

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 自动量化心脏标记MRI中的心肌运动和应变是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，需要准确且可扩展的分析方法

Method: 使用基于学习潜在码的条件隐式神经表示(INRs)来预测连续左心室位移，无需推理时优化

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，取得了最佳追踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)和最低的全局周向应变(2.86%)与径向应变(6.42%)组合误差，速度比最准确基线快380倍

Conclusion: 基于INR的模型适用于大型心脏MRI数据集中心肌应变的准确且可扩展分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet改进了互助学习网络(MLNet)，通过动态权重策略优化开集佣最小化(OEM)，提升了全域适配中已知类别与未知类别的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的互助学习网络对所有分类器一视同仁，洛北了学习信号，需要更有针对性的适配策略。

Method: E-MLNet集成动态权重策略到OEM中，利用闭集分类器的预测来重点适配每个目标样本最相关的类边界。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VisDA-2017和ImageCLEF四个挑战性测试集上，E-MLNet在VisDA和ImageCLEF上获得最高平均H分数，在大多数适配任务中超过MLNet基准。

Conclusion: 动态权重策略能够有效提升全域适配的性能，E-MLNet在开集和部分开集适配场景下都显示了优越的稳健性。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了COCO-Urdu数据集，这是基于MS COCO构建的大规模乌尔都语图像-字幕数据集，包含59,000张图片和319,000个乌尔都语字幕，旨在解决乌尔都语在多模态研究中资源不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为拥有超过2.5亿使用者的语言，在多模态和视觉-语言研究中严重缺乏资源。缺乏大规模高质量数据集限制了乌尔都语系统的发展，并加剧了主要基于高资源语言训练的多语言视觉-语言模型的偏见。

Method: 通过分层采样从MS COCO中选取图像，使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，并采用混合多模态质量评估框架进行验证，包括COMET-Kiwi评估翻译质量、基于CLIP的视觉相似性、BERTScore和回译评估语义一致性。低质量字幕通过开源大语言模型迭代优化。

Result: 构建了包含59,000张图片和319,000个乌尔都语字幕的大规模数据集，在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF基准测试中报告了持续强劲的结果。据作者所知，这是目前最大的公开乌尔都语字幕数据集。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集和质量评估流程，旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉-语言系统建立基础，促进乌尔都语在多模态研究中的发展。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Motivation: 解决现有fMRI视觉解码方法依赖主体特定训练的问题，提高可扩展性和实际部署能力

Method: 集成Token Merging Transformer进行高效体素压缩，使用查询驱动的Q-Former生成与CLIP图像嵌入空间对齐的固定大小神经表示

Result: 在7T自然场景数据集上，VoxelFormer在训练包含的主体上实现了竞争性的检索性能，且参数数量显著少于现有方法

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCGM是一种新的3D脑MRI反事实生成方法，通过概率图模型整合解剖约束，使用ControlNet编码空间掩码来指导扩散模型，生成高质量且解剖合理的脑部MRI图像，能够复现疾病对皮层区域的细微影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实生成模型缺乏明确的归纳偏置来保护细粒度解剖细节，难以生成解剖学上合理的脑部MRI图像，这限制了合成图像在检测细微形态差异研究中的应用。

Method: 提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)，通过概率图模块捕获解剖约束并转换为空间二值掩码，使用3D ControlNet编码这些掩码来约束新的反事实去噪UNet，最终通过3D扩散解码器生成高质量脑部MRI。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PCGM生成的脑部MRI质量优于多个基线方法，并且首次证明从PCGM生成的反事实图像中提取的脑部测量能够复现神经科学文献中报告的疾病对皮层区域的细微影响。

Conclusion: PCGM在合成MRI用于研究细微形态差异方面取得了重要里程碑，为脑部MRI研究提供了高质量的反事实图像生成解决方案。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Motivation: 现有图卷积神经网络在人体动作识别上表现优异，但在人物交互检测方面存在不足，缺乏有效的场景信息表示和适宜的学习架构

Method: 提出了一种考虑环境中固定物体信息的多任务学习方法，并使用自建的数据集（包含与固定物体如ATM机、办理机等的交互类别）进行评估

Result: 多任务学习方法结合交互区域信息，在识别交互和非交互动作方面达到99.25%的准确率，比仅使用人体骨架姿势的基础模型提高2.75%

Conclusion: 通过考虑环境中固定物体信息和采用多任务学习方法，可以有效提升人与固定物体交互动作的识别性能，为人物交互检测领域提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

TL;DR: 提出IRDFusion框架，通过交叉模态特征对比和筛选策略，实现高质量的多光谱目标检测特征融合，抑制背景噪声并增强显著结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多光谱目标检测方法在特征融合时往往保留过多背景或噪声信息，限制了感知性能，需要新的融合策略来解决这个问题

Method: 提出包含互特征精炼模块(MFRM)和差分特征反馈模块(DFFM)的统一框架，形成迭代关系映射差分引导特征融合机制(IRDFusion)，通过迭代反馈逐步放大显著关系信号

Result: 在FLIR、LLVIP和M³FD数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在各种挑战性场景中始终优于现有方法

Conclusion: IRDFusion框架通过创新的特征对比和筛选策略，有效提升了多光谱目标检测的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型计算和内存成本过高，现有的量化和token剪枝方法存在不兼容问题，无法同时实现整体效率提升

Method: 提出新的量化感知token剪枝标准，在激进量化模型上工作，同时改进量化器设计以增强剪枝效果

Result: 在标准VLA模型上实现1.93倍加速，平均成功率提升4.5%，同时保持核心模型性能

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA成功解决了量化和token剪枝的不兼容问题，为VLA模型的实用部署提供了有效的加速方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

TL;DR: S-BEVLoc是一个基于鸟瞰图的自监督LiDAR全局定位框架，无需地面真实位姿，通过地理距离构建训练三元组，在KITTI和NCLT数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LiDAR的全局定位方法依赖GPS或SLAM里程计获取的地面真实位姿进行监督训练，但高精度位姿获取成本高昂且费力。需要开发无需地面真实位姿的自监督方法。

Method: 提出S-BEVLoc自监督框架：1）利用已知地理距离构建BEV图像的三元组训练样本；2）使用CNN提取局部特征，NetVLAD聚合全局描述符；3）引入SoftCos损失函数增强三元组学习。

Result: 在KITTI和NCLT大规模数据集上的实验表明，S-BEVLoc在位置识别、闭环检测和全局定位任务中达到了最先进的性能，同时具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc成功证明了无需地面真实位姿的自监督LiDAR全局定位的可行性，为SLAM系统提供了更实用和可扩展的解决方案，避免了昂贵的地面真实数据采集成本。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,

Motivation: 现有的基础分割模型能够在零样本情况下从顶视图作物图像中提取叶片实例，但分割包含多个重叠叶片的整个植物个体仍然具有挑战性。这个问题通常需要物种特定的标注训练数据集，耗费大量人力。

Method: 整合基础分割模型（提取叶片实例）和视觉语言模型（推理植物结构），无需额外训练即可提取植物个体。通过结合两种模型的能力，实现零样本的植物个体分割。

Result: 在包含多个植物物种、不同生长阶段和拍摄环境的数据集上评估表明，该方法超越了现有的零样本方法，并且比监督方法具有更好的跨域性能。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一种有效的零样本解决方案，能够准确分割莲座状植物个体，避免了标注数据的需求，在植物表型分析等领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP在行人表征学习中面临的两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模标注的行人中心视觉-语言数据，以及全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征。

Method: 1) 利用MLLM的上下文学习能力构建WebPerson数据集(500万高质量图像-文本对)；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，通过梯度-注意力相似度评分自适应掩码噪声文本token，并加入掩码token预测目标。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过协同改进数据筛选和模型架构，成功提升了CLIP在行人表征学习中的效果，特别是在处理噪声文本和保持细粒度特征方面表现出色。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量的sinogram生成，并在多种PET任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET成像大规模基础模型面临标注数据有限和计算资源不足的挑战，需要克服数据稀缺和效率限制。

Method: 采用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1)Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2)正负掩码约束确保几何一致性；3)透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，性能可与大数据集训练模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、可解释且任务自适应的基础模型解决方案，在多种临床应用场景中展现出强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Motivation: 比较持续同调(PH)和人工神经网络(ANN)在从数据推断拓扑结构方面的噪声鲁棒性，探索ANN在拓扑估计中的潜力

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，与基于立方复形和符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程进行对比，在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行测试

Result: ANN在噪声条件下能够超越PH方法，这归功于其从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验知识的能力

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展阶段，但ANN在结构噪声下的拓扑估计为PH提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本调查首次采用数据集驱动的视角，分析视频理解领域的发展，展示数据集特征如何引导模型架构演进，并为通用视频理解提供实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调查主要按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集通过结构压力引导架构演化的作用。本文旨在填补这一空白，从数据集驱动的角度重新解读视频理解发展历程。

Method: 采用数据集驱动分析框架，重点研究运动复杂性、时间跨度、层次组合和多模态丰富性等数据集特征如何为模型施加归纳偏置，并重新诠释从双流网络、3D CNN到序列模型、Transformer和多模态基础模型的发展里程碑。

Result: 建立了数据集、归纳偏置和架构的统一框架，将关键模型发展重新解释为对数据集驱动压力的具体响应，揭示了架构演化的内在逻辑。

Conclusion: 通过将数据集、归纳偏置和架构统一到连贯框架中，本调查既提供了全面的回顾性分析，又为推进通用视频理解提供了规范性路线图，强调模型设计应与数据集不变性对齐，同时平衡可扩展性和任务需求。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023挑战赛通过提供多尺度重叠细胞和组织标注数据集，验证了细胞-组织相互作用理解对于提升细胞检测性能的重要性，最佳模型相比仅细胞检测基线F1分数提升了7.99。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家在检查全切片图像时会在不同放大倍数间切换以评估组织形态和细胞细节，但现有深度学习细胞检测模型难以模拟这种行为并学习不同尺度结构间的相互依赖语义。

Method: OCELOT 2023挑战赛收集了来自306个TCGA全切片图像的673对重叠细胞检测和组织分割标注数据，涵盖六个器官，参与者开发了能够理解细胞-组织关系的模型。

Result: 顶级参赛模型在测试集上相比不包含细胞-组织关系的基线细胞检测模型，F1分数提升了高达7.99，显示出显著性能改进。

Conclusion: 研究证明了将多尺度语义纳入模型的必要性，细胞-组织相互作用的理解对于实现人类水平性能至关重要，OCELOT挑战赛加速了这一领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的知识聚焦框架来解决KB-VQA中的知识冗余问题，通过改进检索查询、提取关键知识片段和选择性知识集成策略，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KB-VQA方法直接将检索到的知识信息增强模型，但忽略了大量知识冗余问题，这些冗余信息在回答过程中引入了噪声

Method: 1) 从图像-问题对中提取关键部分创建低噪声查询；2) 使用大模型识别和提取对答案有益的知识片段；3) 引入选择性知识集成策略，仅在模型对回答问题缺乏信心时整合知识

Result: 大量实验表明，该框架优于最先进的方法，能够获取准确且关键的知识

Conclusion: 所提出的训练免费框架通过减少知识冗余和增强知识相关性，有效提升了KB-VQA任务的性能

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出CWSSNet分类框架，融合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，有效解决高光谱图像特征冗余问题，在江西余干县地物分类中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术在地物分类中具有重要应用价值，但由于波段众多、维度高、光谱混合等特点导致特征冗余问题突出，需要新的方法来突破传统分类方法的性能瓶颈。

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱图像数据，提出CWSSNet分类框架，整合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作。

Result: 在余干县实验中，CWSSNet在mIoU、mAcc和mF1上分别达到74.50%、82.73%和84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地分类中获得最高IoU，且在70%训练集比例下训练时间增加有限，小样本训练条件下性能可靠。

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架有效解决了高光谱图像特征冗余问题，突破了传统分类方法的性能瓶颈，具有良好的鲁棒性和小样本训练能力，为高光谱遥感地物分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级自适应性Dark-ISP插件，直接处理RAW图像来改善明照环境下的物体检测性能。通过将传统ISP流程解构为可微分组件并使用任务驱动优化，该方法在三个RAW数据集上超越了现有的RGB和RAW基于检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明照环境下的物体检测面临图像质量降级的挑战。虽然RAW图像比RGB图像具有更好的潜力，但现有方法或者使用有信息损失的RAW-RGB图像，或者采用复杂的框架。需要一种轻量级且能直接处理RAW图像的方案。

Method: 1. 将传统ISP流程解构为线性传感器校准和非线性音调映射子模块，重构为可微分组件通过任务驱动损失优化
2. 每个模块配备内容自适应性和物理信息先验知识
3. 利用ISP流程的内在级联结构，设计自成增强机制促进子模块合作

Conclusion: Dark-ISP插件通过轻量级设计和自适应性方案，成功地解决了明照环境下物体检测的挑战，为实际应用提供了一种高效的端到端训练方案。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Conclusion: Medverse为医学影像分析提供了一个强大的通用上下文学习解决方案，代码和模型权重已公开。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

*Chao Yuan,Yang Yang,Yehui Yang,Zach Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DATE方法，通过时间戳注入机制和语义引导的时间感知采样策略，增强多模态大语言模型的长视频时序理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长视频中的长距离依赖关系，导致关键信息丢失和时序理解能力下降

Method: 1) 时间戳注入机制(TIM)：将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳标记交错构建连续时间参考系统；2) 时间感知相似性采样(TASS)：将视频采样重新表述为视觉语言检索任务，采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时间覆盖

Result: 在小时级长视频基准测试中取得最先进性能，7B模型在某些基准上甚至超越了许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法显著提升了多模态大语言模型在绝对时间理解和关键事件定位方面的能力，为长视频理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割中资源消耗大、时间长的限制，以及现有高效分割模型静态设计、缺乏跨任务适应性的问题。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现动态高效的3D分割。

Result: 轻量级变体PSP-Seg-S在五个数据集上与nnU-Net性能相当，GPU内存使用减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是一种成本效益高且性能优异的替代方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图表理解方法的局限性：外部工具方法容易出错且受限于预定工具套，而专业模型通常只采用单一的文本链式思维策略，中间步骤难以验证。

Method: 提出Code-as-Thought（CaT）方法，将图表视觉信息转换为可验证的符号格式。引入可学习的视觉程序化概念，让VLM适应性地选择代码路径或直接视觉推理路径。使用双重奖励系统通过增强学习训练选择策略。

Result: 在多样化的图表理解测试集上表现出强大且稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了VLMs不仅可以学会推理，还能够学会如何推理，动态选择每个任务的最优推理路径。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Motivation: 现有脑MRI分割模型大多局限于固定模态，无法有效处理推理时的新模态。一些模型虽然能泛化到未见模态，但可能丢失模态特定的判别信息。

Method: 在U-net架构中集成模态无关输入通道和模态特定通道，通过图像增强方案合成人工MRI模态来训练模态无关组件，保持病理组织和健康组织的外观差异同时维持解剖完整性。

Result: 在包含5种病理类型和8种MRI模态的8个数据库上评估，结果显示该方法能有效处理训练时见过的MRI模态，同时能处理新的未见模态来改进分割效果。

Conclusion: 通过简单的架构修改和图像增强策略，实现了对异构MRI模态组合的有效分割，提高了模型的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统闭集检测器在域偏移和飞行数据损坏情况下性能显著下降，对安全关键应用构成风险，需要开发能够处理未知物体的鲁棒检测方法。

Method: 基于嵌入检测器的模型无关开放式检测框架，通过嵌入空间熵建模估计语义不确定性，结合光谱归一化和温度缩放来增强开放式判别能力，并采用背景抑制进一步提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在AOT空中基准测试和真实飞行测试中验证，相比标准YOLO检测器获得高达10%的相对AUROC提升，背景抑制在不影响检测精度的情况下进一步增强了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于动态空对空环境中的可靠无人机感知，为安全关键应用提供了有效的开放式检测解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）与目标具有相似的强度和模式，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级slot注意力模块整合多级特征，增强slot表征的区分性。

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像分类中达到了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征融合和注意力机制，有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波分离的挑战，无需掩码标注即可实现鲁棒的目标表征学习。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Motivation: 现实世界中不同车辆的感知模型存在异构性，现有方法需要联合训练或预先存储所有可能协作方的模型，这在实践中不可行。

Method: 提出渐进式异构协作感知(PHCP)框架，将问题建模为少样本无监督域适应，在推理时通过自训练适配器动态对齐特征。

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上的大量实验表明，PHCP在多种异构场景下都表现出色，仅使用少量未标注数据就能达到与SOTA方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: PHCP成功解决了无需联合训练的异构协作感知问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Conclusion: 预训练的成功依赖于域相关性而非数据规模，选择合适的预训练数据源对少学习手术技能评传至关重要

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种全自动的两阶段框架，通过视神经镜夹直径测量和临床数据融合，实现了无创伤的内顶压分级评估，显著提升了测量准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的腰椎穹刺测量内顶压存在侵入性风险，而目前的视神经镜夹直径手工测量方法存在不一致性、主观性和阈值变异性等问题，必须开发更可靠的无创伤处理方案。

Method: 设计了全自动两阶段框架：第一阶段进行眼底超声视频处理（床面分割、基于规则的关键帧识别、精确ONSD测量），第二阶段融合ONSD指标和临床特征进行内顶压分级预测。

Result: 验证集准确率达到0.845±0.071（五折交叉验证），独立测试集准确率0.786，显著超过传统阈值方法（验证准确率0.637±0.111，测试准确率0.429）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少操作变异性和融合多源信息，建立了可靠的无创伤内顶压评估方法，有望改善急性神经疾病患者的管理水平。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

<details>

Motivation: IC制造中精细缺陷影响生产率和可靠性，传统方法需要外部正常对比集且对对齐要求高，而IC布局多样化导致方法脆弱

Method: 设计可学习正常信息提取器从测试图像聚合正常特征，使用一致性损失确保特征与正常区域关联，通过解码器重构正常内容，重构残差用于缺陷分割，使用伪异常增广稳定训练

Result: 在三个IC制造步骤数据集上进行实验，结果显示方法比现有方法更一致地改进，并展现出对产品变化的强壁型性

Conclusion: 该无监督框架能够有效分割IC缺陷，不需外部正常对比集，具有良好的应用前景

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型在临床决策支持中具有潜力，但由于成像协议和自由文本报告的变异性，模型容易学习任务无关的相关性，导致在真实世界部署中的可靠性问题。

Method: 提出结构化特征解耦框架DRiFt，使用参数高效调优（LoRA）和可学习提示令牌，明确分离临床相关信号和任务无关噪声。同时通过为多样化医学数据集生成高质量、临床基础的图像-文本对来增强跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于构建更安全、更可信的临床用视觉语言模型，通过减少领域偏移下的不可预测行为来提高部署安全性。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Motivation: 在军事侦察和远程检测等实际应用中，多模态图像中的目标和背景结构容易受损，分辨率低且语义信息弱，导致现有融合技术效果不佳，需要开发能够同时处理图像融合和超分辨率的方法。

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Result: 在BraTS-Africa数据集的95个MRI病例上，增强肿瘤区域Dice得分0.76，坏死和非增强肿瘤核心0.80，周围非功能性半球0.85。模型大小约90MB，单个体积推理时间不到1分钟。

Conclusion: 该模型在数据质量和数量有限的情况下仍表现出良好的泛化能力，具有在低资源环境中支持临床决策的潜力，有助于缩小全球健康AI公平性差距。

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and

Motivation: 主流图像级自监督学习方法在密集任务中存在过度分散现象，即来自同一实例/类别的补丁分散，影响下游密集任务性能。研究发现图像级SSL通过隐式语义集中避免此问题，但这种方法不适用于空间敏感的密集SSL。

Method: 1) 通过蒸馏补丁对应关系打破严格空间对齐；2) 提出噪声容忍排序损失，将AP损失扩展到连续目标，防止学生模型被误导；3) 提出对象感知过滤器，通过跨注意力将输出空间映射到基于对象的空间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式语义集中解决了密集自监督学习中的过度分散问题，提出的补丁对应关系蒸馏和噪声容忍排序损失等技术显著提升了密集表示学习性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional

Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部影像诊断中可能存在捷径学习问题，即使用与输出标签无关的虚假特征进行预测。当这些特征与受保护属性相关时，会导致对代表性不足群体（如种族和性别）的性能偏见。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测脑肿瘤的时空进展对于指导神经肿瘤学的临床决策至关重要，需要生成既符合解剖结构又反映肿瘤生长模式的未来影像

Method: 使用常微分方程构建机制模型捕捉肿瘤动态（包括放疗效果），结合梯度引导的DDIM扩散模型进行图像合成，以预测的生长估计为条件

Result: 在BraTS数据集和内部儿科DMG病例上验证，生成真实的随访扫描，提供肿瘤生长概率图，显示95% Hausdorff距离的临床相关生长范围和方向性

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限情况下实现生物信息驱动的图像生成，提供考虑机制先验的生成式时空预测

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

TL;DR: 提出SGDF方法和GDCN网络，通过生成扩散融合机制解决多视图聚类中低质量数据问题，在深度MVC任务中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图聚类中存在低质量数据问题，主要源于某些视图被噪声数据污染或存在数据缺失，这影响了多视图融合和聚类性能

Method: 提出随机生成扩散融合(SGDF)方法，利用多重生成机制处理每个样本的多视图特征，并在此基础上构建生成扩散对比网络(GDCN)

Result: 大量实验表明GDCN在深度多视图聚类任务中取得了最先进的成果

Conclusion: SGDF方法能够有效处理多视图聚类中的低质量数据问题，GDCN网络在性能上表现优异

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: DualTrack是一种新颖的双编码器架构，通过解耦的局部和全局编码器分别处理超声图像中的细粒度特征和高级解剖特征，实现了传感器无关的3D超声重建，在大型公共基准测试中达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，而现有的传感器无关3D超声方法要么忽略全局特征，要么将全局特征与局部特征提取紧密耦合，限制了鲁棒建模能力。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像主干网络和时序注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征；轻量级融合模块结合特征估计轨迹。

Result: 在大型公共基准测试中达到最先进精度，平均重建误差低于5mm，实现了全局一致的3D重建，优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DualTrack通过解耦的局部和全局特征提取有效解决了传感器无关3D超声重建问题，证明了双编码器架构在医学影像分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性之间达到了最佳平衡，为大规模VFM适应实际遥感变化检测应用提供了强大且可扩展的范式

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar是一个新颖的级联框架，通过多模态指令理解和照片级真实感肖像生成，解决了现有音频驱动虚拟人视频生成方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将指令条件视为由声学或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，而没有建模指令传达的交流目的，这限制了叙事连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）导演生成蓝图视频，控制角色动作和情感等高级语义；第二阶段在蓝图关键帧指导下，使用首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长达1080p和48fps的长时视频，在唇形同步准确性、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础的高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成设立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注识别准确性，忽略了模型识别"没有正确答案"这一关键能力，这在安全关键应用中至关重要。

Method: 基于全景场景图数据集，利用细粒度场景图标注提取真实实体和关系，通过GPT-4-Turbo生成选择题并进行人工筛选，每个问题都包含"以上都不是"选项。

Conclusion: HumbleBench通过明确评估错误选项拒绝能力，填补了当前评估套件的关键空白，为安全关键环境中的MLLM可靠性提供了更真实的衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态学习领域实现了令人惊喜的突破，展示了理解和生成过程的协同增强效果

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Conclusion: NRMF通过几何感知的神经距离场方法为3D人体运动恢复提供了鲁棒、时间一致且物理合理的解决方案，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性特性是图像数据集统计属性的自然结果，而非卷积网络架构的归纳偏置，这一发现为理解扩散模型行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured

Conclusion: 该研究通过大规模推理数据集和综合评估基准，为推理导向的文本到图像生成开辟了新途径，有望催化下一代模型发展。

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to
catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:

### [79] [PerFairX: Is There a Balance Between Fairness and Personality in Large Language Model Recommendations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08829)
*Chandan Kumar Sah*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: PerFairX框架评估LLM推荐系统中个性化和人口公平性之间的权衡，发现个性感知提示能改善心理对齐但加剧公平性差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推荐系统通过OCEAN人格模型实现零样本个性化，但存在心理对齐与人口公平性之间的紧张关系，需要量化这种权衡

Method: 提出PerFairX评估框架，使用中性和个性敏感提示，在MovieLens和Last.fm数据集上测试ChatGPT和DeepSeek，分析个性化和公平性指标

Result: 个性感知提示显著改善个体特质对齐但加剧人口群体公平性差距；DeepSeek心理拟合更强但对提示变化更敏感；ChatGPT输出更稳定但个性化程度较低

Conclusion: PerFairX为开发既公平又心理感知的LLM推荐系统提供原则性基准，有助于构建包容性、用户中心的持续学习AI应用

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has
enabled zero-shot, personality-based personalization through prompt-based
interactions, offering a new paradigm for user-centric recommendations.
However, incorporating user personality traits via the OCEAN model highlights a
critical tension between achieving psychological alignment and ensuring
demographic fairness. To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified
evaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between
personalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using
neutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we
benchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens
10M) and music (Last.fm 360K) datasets. Our results reveal that
personality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual
traits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups.
Specifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher
sensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less
personalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the
development of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and
psychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive,
user-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文指出在健康相关查询中，过度对齐的LLMs会产生过于谨慎的回应，这可能对焦虑症和强迫症患者造成伤害，呼吁开发具有更强推理能力的模型来提供更细致化的健康回应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于LLMs对齐的讨论主要关注防止有害输出，但作者发现在健康查询场景中，过度对齐导致的过度谨慎回应本身可能对心理健康问题患者造成伤害，这在伦理和安全层面都存在风险。

Method: 通过定性分析展示不同LLMs在健康查询中表现出不同程度的对齐行为，揭示了过度对齐问题的存在。

Result: 研究发现一些LLMs确实存在过度对齐现象，导致对健康查询给出过于谨慎的回应，这可能对焦虑症和OCD患者产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 需要开发具有更强推理能力的LLMs，能够为健康查询提供更加量身定制和细致入微的回应，避免过度对齐带来的潜在危害。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually aligned with "human
values/preferences" to prevent harmful output. Discussions around the alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs) generally focus on preventing harmful outputs.
However, in this paper, we argue that in health-related queries,
over-alignment-leading to overly cautious responses-can itself be harmful,
especially for people with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
This is not only unethical but also dangerous to the user, both mentally and
physically. We also showed qualitative results that some LLMs exhibit varying
degrees of alignment. Finally, we call for the development of LLMs with
stronger reasoning capabilities that provide more tailored and nuanced
responses to health queries. Warning: This paper contains materials that could
trigger health anxiety or OCD.

*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 大数据分析和AI对隐私构成威胁，主要因为黑盒问题导致判断和行为无法获得合理评价。文章区分了三种不透明性，讨论了它们如何影响隐私保护的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大数据分析和AI中的黑盒问题如何加剧隐私风险，以及为什么现有的隐私保护措施在这种环境下效果减弱。

Method: 通过理论分析和概念区分，将不透明性分为三类：浅层不透明性、标准黑盒不透明性和深层不透明性，并分析它们对隐私保护的影响。

Result: 证明在不透明性条件下，相关方无法提供合理的判断供隐私保护，如知情同意和匿名化等。大数据分析使隐私问题更严重且治理措施效果更差。

Conclusion: 大数据分析和AI的黑盒特性严重影响隐私保护的基础，需要把技术方案结合进来解决这些挑战。

Abstract: It is known that big data analytics and AI pose a threat to privacy, and that
some of this is due to some kind of "black box problem" in AI. I explain how
this becomes a problem in the context of justification for judgments and
actions. Furthermore, I suggest distinguishing three kinds of opacity: 1) the
subjects do not know what the system does ("shallow opacity"), 2) the analysts
do not know what the system does ("standard black box opacity"), or 3) the
analysts cannot possibly know what the system might do ("deep opacity"). If the
agents, data subjects as well as analytics experts, operate under opacity, then
these agents cannot provide justifications for judgments that are necessary to
protect privacy, e.g., they cannot give "informed consent", or guarantee
"anonymity". It follows from these points that agents in big data analytics and
AI often cannot make the judgments needed to protect privacy. So I conclude
that big data analytics makes the privacy problems worse and the remedies less
effective. As a positive note, I provide a brief outlook on technical ways to
handle this situation.

*Marvin van Bekkum,Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文探讨GDPR对特殊类别个人数据的使用限制是否阻碍了防止AI驱动的歧视，分析了在欧洲法律框架下使用敏感数据进行AI系统审计的法律障碍，并讨论了是否应该为此类反歧视目的创建例外条款。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着组织越来越多地使用AI系统进行人事决策（如招聘筛选），AI系统可能产生无意识的歧视性影响。但在欧洲，由于GDPR禁止使用种族等敏感数据，组织难以评估其AI系统是否存在基于种族的歧视，这引发了隐私保护与反歧视政策之间的紧张关系。

Method: 采用法律分析方法，研究GDPR关于特殊类别个人数据的使用规定，分析欧盟委员会AI法案提案中的相关条款，并系统梳理支持和反对为反歧视目的创建数据使用例外的论据。

Result: 研究发现GDPR确实在许多情况下禁止使用特殊类别数据进行AI系统审计，这确实构成了防止AI驱动歧视的障碍。同时识别了支持创建例外条款的主要论据（如促进平等、提高透明度）和反对论据（如隐私风险、可能加剧歧视）。

Conclusion: GDPR对敏感数据使用的限制确实对防止AI歧视构成了挑战，需要在隐私保护和反歧视之间寻求平衡。虽然创建例外条款存在争议，但这一问题具有全球相关性，许多国家的政策制定者都面临类似的权衡困境。

Abstract: Organisations can use artificial intelligence to make decisions about people
for a variety of reasons, for instance, to select the best candidates from many
job applications. However, AI systems can have discriminatory effects when used
for decision-making. To illustrate, an AI system could reject applications of
people with a certain ethnicity, while the organisation did not plan such
ethnicity discrimination. But in Europe, an organisation runs into a problem
when it wants to assess whether its AI system accidentally discriminates based
on ethnicity: the organisation may not know the applicants' ethnicity. In
principle, the GDPR bans the use of certain 'special categories of data'
(sometimes called 'sensitive data'), which include data on ethnicity, religion,
and sexual preference. The proposal for an AI Act of the European Commission
includes a provision that would enable organisations to use special categories
of data for auditing their AI systems. This paper asks whether the GDPR's rules
on special categories of personal data hinder the prevention of AI-driven
discrimination. We argue that the GDPR does prohibit such use of special
category data in many circumstances. We also map out the arguments for and
against creating an exception to the GDPR's ban on using special categories of
personal data, to enable preventing discrimination by AI systems. The paper
discusses European law, but the paper can be relevant outside Europe too, as
many policymakers in the world grapple with the tension between privacy and
non-discrimination policy.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文探讨了算法决策对反歧视法的挑战，分析了当前法律保护中的漏洞，并提出了应对算法区分的最佳法律框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法决策虽然能提升社会效率，但可能产生歧视性影响。当前反歧视法在面对算法基于非受保护特征（如浏览器偏好、门牌号等）进行区分时存在保护漏洞，这些新型区分可能加剧社会不平等。

Method: 通过分析算法决策的特点和现有反歧视法律体系的局限性，探讨最适合应对算法区分问题的法律框架，重点关注欧洲法律体系但具有普适性理论价值。

Result: 识别出现有反歧视法在应对算法决策时的多个漏洞，特别是算法能够基于与受保护特征无关的数据点创建新的区分类别，这些类别可能逃避现有法律监管但仍造成不公平。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考和完善反歧视法律体系，以有效应对算法决策带来的新型歧视风险，立法者应制定能够涵盖算法基于任意特征进行区分的法律框架，确保公平性保护。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-making and similar types of artificial intelligence (AI)
may lead to improvements in all sectors of society, but can also have
discriminatory effects. While current non-discrimination law offers people some
protection, algorithmic decision-making presents the law with several
challenges. For instance, algorithms can generate new categories of people
based on seemingly innocuous characteristics, such as web browser preference or
apartment number, or more complicated categories combining many data points.
Such new types of differentiation could evade non-discrimination law, as
browser type and house number are not protected characteristics, but such
differentiation could still be unfair, for instance if it reinforces social
inequality.
  This paper explores which system of non-discrimination law can best be
applied to algorithmic decision-making, considering that algorithms can
differentiate on the basis of characteristics that do not correlate with
protected grounds of discrimination such as ethnicity or gender. The paper
analyses the current loopholes in the protection offered by non-discrimination
law and explores the best way for lawmakers to approach algorithmic
differentiation. While we focus on Europe, the conceptual and theoretical focus
of the paper can make it useful for scholars and policymakers from other
regions too, as they encounter similar problems with algorithmic
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究实时投标广告技术与欧洲数据保护法规（特别是GDPR）的兼容性问题，分析RTB系统在法律基础、透明性和安全性方面是否符合法律要求。

Method: 首先介绍和分析当前线上部署的RTB技术系统，然后从法律角度分析RTB在GDPR要求的处理法律基础、透明性和安全性方面的符合性。

Result: 1. GDPR要求RTB必须获得用户先前同意；2. 网站出版商和RTB公司难以满足透明性要求；3. RTB制度制弊不安全数据处理。

Conclusion: 在理念和实践中，RTB在结构上难以与欧洲数据保护法规协调，需要监管机构的干预。

Abstract: This article discusses the troubled relationship between contemporary
advertising technology (adtech) systems, in particular systems of real-time
bidding (RTB, also known as programmatic advertising) underpinning much
behavioral targeting on the web and through mobile applications. This article
analyzes the extent to which practices of RTB are compatible with the
requirements regarding a legal basis for processing, transparency, and security
in European data protection law. We first introduce the technologies at play
through explaining and analyzing the systems deployed online today. Following
that, we turn to the law. Rather than analyze RTB against every provision of
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we consider RTB in the context
of the GDPR's requirement of a legal basis for processing and the GDPR's
transparency and security requirements. We show, first, that the GDPR requires
prior consent of the internet user for RTB, as other legal bases are not
appropriate. Second, we show that it is difficult - and perhaps impossible -
for website publishers and RTB companies to meet the GDPR's transparency
requirements. Third, RTB incentivizes insecure data processing. We conclude
that, in concept and in practice, RTB is structurally difficult to reconcile
with European data protection law. Therefore, intervention by regulators is
necessary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地介入情感敏感对话（特别是心理健康领域），需要评估它们在危机情况下的响应能力以确保公共安全

Method: 使用模拟心理健康危机披露的用户提示，基于临床医生开发的编码框架评估5个安全导向行为：风险确认、同理心、鼓励求助、提供具体资源、邀请继续对话

Result: Claude在整体评估中表现最佳，Grok 3、ChatGPT和LLAMA在多个领域表现不佳。大多数模型展现同理心但很少提供实际支持或持续互动

Conclusion: LLMs在情感沟通方面显示潜力，但目前没有模型达到满意的危机响应临床标准，需要持续开发和针对性微调以确保AI在心理健康领域的道德部署

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate emotionally sensitive
conversations, especially in mental health contexts, their ability to recognize
and respond to high-risk situations becomes a matter of public safety. This
study evaluates the responses of six popular LLMs (Claude, Gemini, Deepseek,
ChatGPT, Grok 3, and LLAMA) to user prompts simulating crisis-level mental
health disclosures. Drawing on a coding framework developed by licensed
clinicians, five safety-oriented behaviors were assessed: explicit risk
acknowledgment, empathy, encouragement to seek help, provision of specific
resources, and invitation to continue the conversation. Claude outperformed all
others in global assessment, while Grok 3, ChatGPT, and LLAMA underperformed
across multiple domains. Notably, most models exhibited empathy, but few
consistently provided practical support or sustained engagement. These findings
suggest that while LLMs show potential for emotionally attuned communication,
none currently meet satisfactory clinical standards for crisis response.
Ongoing development and targeted fine-tuning are essential to ensure ethical
deployment of AI in mental health settings.

Abstract: There is an increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in safety-critical
applications, yet practical schemes for certifying that AI systems are safe,
lawful and socially acceptable remain scarce. This white paper presents the
T\"UV AUSTRIA Trusted AI framework an end-to-end audit catalog and methodology
for assessing and certifying machine learning systems. The audit catalog has
been in continuous development since 2019 in an ongoing collaboration with
scientific partners. Building on three pillars - Secure Software Development,
Functional Requirements, and Ethics & Data Privacy - the catalog translates the
high-level obligations of the EU AI Act into specific, testable criteria. Its
core concept of functional trustworthiness couples a statistically defined
application domain with risk-based minimum performance requirements and
statistical testing on independently sampled data, providing transparent and
reproducible evidence of model quality in real-world settings. We provide an
overview of the functional requirements that we assess, which are oriented on
the lifecycle of an AI system. In addition, we share some lessons learned from
the practical application of the audit catalog, highlighting common pitfalls we
encountered, such as data leakage scenarios, inadequate domain definitions,
neglect of biases, or a lack of distribution drift controls. We further discuss
key aspects of certifying AI systems, such as robustness, algorithmic fairness,
or post-certification requirements, outlining both our current conclusions and
a roadmap for future research. In general, by aligning technical best practices
with emerging European standards, the approach offers regulators, providers,
and users a practical roadmap for legally compliant, functionally trustworthy,
and certifiable AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用Overton Window框架来评估LLM的政治偏见，通过PRISM方法测试发现不同模型在表达政治立场时的限制程度存在显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统审计方法往往将模型的政治立场定位为点估计，掩盖了模型愿意或不愿意表达的意识形态边界范围，需要更丰富的评估框架

Method: 使用PRISM审计方法，通过任务驱动的提示词间接探测LLM的政治立场，采用政治指南针测试评估28个来自8个提供商的LLM

Result: 大多数模型默认采用经济左派和社会自由派立场，但表达立场的意愿差异很大：DeepSeek模型限制性最强，Gemini模型表达范围最广

Conclusion: Overton Window提供了更丰富、更细致的LLM政治偏见视图，为审计其规范边界提供了新的视角

Abstract: Political bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a growing concern for
the responsible deployment of AI systems. Traditional audits often attempt to
locate a model's political position as a point estimate, masking the broader
set of ideological boundaries that shape what a model is willing or unwilling
to say. In this paper, we draw upon the concept of the Overton Window as a
framework for mapping these boundaries: the range of political views that a
given LLM will espouse, remain neutral on, or refuse to endorse. To uncover
these windows, we applied an auditing-based methodology, called PRISM, that
probes LLMs through task-driven prompts designed to elicit political stances
indirectly. Using the Political Compass Test, we evaluated twenty-eight LLMs
from eight providers to reveal their distinct Overton Windows. While many
models default to economically left and socially liberal positions, we show
that their willingness to express or reject certain positions varies
considerably, where DeepSeek models tend to be very restrictive in what they
will discuss and Gemini models tend to be most expansive. Our findings
demonstrate that Overton Windows offer a richer, more nuanced view of political
bias in LLMs and provide a new lens for auditing their normative boundaries.

TL;DR: 本文报呈了在EFL教育中尝试使用vibe coding（通过自然语言与AI协作创建软件应用）的初步实践。研究发现学生的提示工程方法、AI心智模型和作者权分配差异影响了编码效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过人工智能技术支持英语作为外语的教学，尤其是通过vibe coding技术让学生能够使用自然语言与AI协作创建应用来解决真实的英语写作挑战。

Method: 采用案例研究方法，开发了一个四小时的工作坊，让两名学生设计应用程序。通过工作表、视频录制、出声思考协议、屏幕录制和AI生成图像收集数据，分析了人工智能元语言框架的三个维度：与AI对话、通过AI对话和关于AI的对话。

Result: 对比案例显示，一名学生成功创建了符合设计意图的功能性应用，而另一名学生遇到技术困难且实际功能与预期设计存在巨大差距。学生在提示工程、AI心智模型和作者权分配方面的差异导致了不同的编码结果。

Conclusion: AI作为有益的语言机器，学生如何与AI交互的方式决定了vibe coding的成效。有效的vibe coding教学需要明确的元语言脚手架支持，包括教授结构化提示工程、促进关于作者权的批判性讨论，以及发展表达AI心智模型的词汇。

Abstract: This innovative practice article reports on the piloting of vibe coding
(using natural language to create software applications with AI) for English as
a Foreign Language (EFL) education. We developed a human-AI meta-languaging
framework with three dimensions: talking to AI (prompt engineering), talking
through AI (negotiating authorship), and talking about AI (mental models of
AI). Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where
two students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges.
We adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video
recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images.
Contrasting cases showed one student successfully vibe coding a functional
application cohering to her intended design, while another encountered
technical difficulties with major gaps between intended design and actual
functionality. Analysis reveals differences in students' prompt engineering
approaches, suggesting different AI mental models and tensions in attributing
authorship. We argue that AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine, and
that differences in how students talk to, through, and about AI explain vibe
coding outcome variations. Findings indicate that effective vibe coding
instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, teaching structured
prompt engineering, facilitating critical authorship discussions, and
developing vocabulary for articulating AI mental models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLM对齐技术主要反映了窄隙参考组的规范偏好，将其价值观强加给广大用户群体，导致知识生产和管理权力向已有影响力机构集中，需要去中心化来对抗这种知识不公正和民主过程涅变。

Method: 提出以下三个特征来实现去中心化对齐：语境、多元论和参与性。通过具体使用案例来基于这些特征，并详细描述不同使用场景下对齐应用的细腻要求。

Result: 本文展示了语境、多元论和参与性在去中心化对齐中的关键作用，提供了具体案例来说明这些策略，并证明了不同使用场景下对齐应用的细腻性要求。

Conclusion: LLM对齐可以成为对抗知识不公正和民主过程涅变的潜在场域，但仅靠这些策略无法替代更广泛的社会变革。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods have been credited with the
commercial success of products like ChatGPT, given their role in steering LLMs
towards user-friendly outputs. However, current alignment techniques
predominantly mirror the normative preferences of a narrow reference group,
effectively imposing their values on a wide user base. Drawing on theories of
the power/knowledge nexus, this work argues that current alignment practices
centralise control over knowledge production and governance within already
influential institutions. To counter this, we propose decentralising alignment
through three characteristics: context, pluralism, and participation.
Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the critical importance of delineating the
context-of-use when shaping alignment practices by grounding each of these
features in concrete use cases. This work makes the following contributions:
(1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in
decentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these
strategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with
applying alignment across different contexts of use. Ultimately, this paper
positions LLM alignment as a potential site of resistance against epistemic
injustice and the erosion of democratic processes, while acknowledging that
these strategies alone cannot substitute for broader societal changes.

scheduled hours. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for bridging this
gap, but interactions between students and LLMs are rarely overseen by
educators. We developed and studied an LLM-powered course assistant deployed
across multiple computer science courses to characterize real-world use and
understand pedagogical implications. By Spring 2024, our system had been
deployed to approximately 2,000 students across six courses at three
institutions. Analysis of the interaction data shows that usage remains strong
in the evenings and nights and is higher in introductory courses, indicating
that our system helps address temporal support gaps and novice learner needs.
We sampled 200 conversations per course for manual annotation: most sampled
responses were judged correct and helpful, with a small share unhelpful or
erroneous; few responses included dedicated examples. We also examined an
inquiry-based learning strategy: only around 11% of sampled conversations
contained LLM-generated follow-up questions, which were often ignored by
students in advanced courses. A Bloom's taxonomy analysis reveals that current
LLM capabilities are limited in generating higher-order cognitive questions.
These patterns suggest opportunities for pedagogically oriented LLM-based
educational systems and greater educator involvement in configuring prompts,
content, and policies.

### [92] [Towards Trustworthy AI: Characterizing User-Reported Risks across LLMs "In the Wild"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08912)
*Lingyao Li,Renkai Ma,Zhaoqian Xue,Junjie Xiong*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 用户通过Reddit讨论揭示了不同LLM聊天机器人的多重风险分布，发现风险并非均匀分布而是具有平台特异性，与实验室研究存在差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM风险的研究多为实验室基础的，与用户实际遇到的问题脱节，需要从用户视角全面理解不同LLM聊天机器人的多重风险

Method: 采用美国NIST人工智能风险管理框架，分析Reddit上关于4个主要LLM聊天机器人的在线讨论

Result: 用户报告的风险分布不均匀且具有平台特异性：GPT主要涉及"安全"和"公平"风险，Gemini主要是"隐私"风险，Claude主要是"安全和弹性"风险，不同风险的体验形式也不同

Conclusion: 研究显示了系统中心化研究与用户实际风险体验之间的差距，强调需要用户中心的方法来支持用户在日常使用LLM聊天机器人时的需求

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly integrating into daily life,
research on their risks often remains lab-based and disconnected from the
problems users encounter "in the wild." While recent HCI research has begun to
explore these user-facing risks, it typically concentrates on a singular LLM
chatbot like ChatGPT or an isolated risk like privacy. To gain a holistic
understanding of multi-risk across LLM chatbots, we analyze online discussions
on Reddit around seven major LLM chatbots through the U.S. NIST's AI Risk
Management Framework. We find that user-reported risks are unevenly distributed
and platform-specific. While "Valid and Reliable" risk is the most frequently
mentioned, each product also exhibits a unique "risk fingerprint;" for
instance, user discussions associate GPT more with "Safe" and "Fair" issues,
Gemini with "Privacy," and Claude with "Secure and Resilient" risks.
Furthermore, the nature of these risks differs by their prevalence: less
frequent risks like "Explainability" and "Privacy" manifest as nuanced user
trade-offs, more common ones like "Fairness" are experienced as direct personal
harms. Our findings reveal gaps between risks reported by system-centered
studies and by users, highlighting the need for user-centered approaches that
support users in their daily use of LLM chatbots.

Abstract: This document details the narrative and technical design behind the process
of generating a quasi-realistic set X data for a fictional multi-day pop
culture episode (AuraSight). Social media post simulation is essential towards
creating realistic training scenarios for understanding emergent network
behavior that formed from known sets of agents. Our social media post
generation pipeline uses the AESOP-SynSM engine, which employs a hybrid
approach of agent-based and generative artificial intelligence techniques. We
explicate choices in scenario setup and summarize the fictional groups
involved, before moving on to the operationalization of these actors and their
interactions within the SynSM engine. We also briefly illustrate some outputs
generated and discuss the utility of such simulated data and potential future
improvements.

TL;DR: 该文章提出了通信AI事故的精确定义和类型学，指出它们是传统网络安全和数据保护框架之外的独特风险类别，并以印度为例提出了针对高风险AI故障报告的政策建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在通信基础设施中的集成引入了算法偏见和系统行为不可预测等新风险，这些风险超出了传统网络安全和数据保护框架的范围，需要被认为独立的监管关注点。

Method: 使用印度作为缺乏水平AI法规的法征案例研究，分析其主要数字规定，包括2023年通信法、2023年数字个人数据保护法和CERT-In规则，并检查现有AI事故仓库的限制。

Result: 分析显示印度现有法律工具主要关注网络安全和数据泄漏，对于算法偏见和性能降级等AI特定运营事故存在重大监管空白，同时识别了报告的结构性障碍。

Conclusion: 文章提出了针对性政策建议，包括将AI事故报告整合到印度现有通信治理中，要求高风险AI故障的强制报告，指定现有政府机构作为管理事故数据的核心机构，并开发标准化报告框架，为其他国家经营现有部门框架内的AI风险提供可复制的蓝图。

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications
infrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and
unpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional
cybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise
definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents,
establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond
conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their
recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for
jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's
key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal
instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and
the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data
breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational
incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also
examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI
incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted
policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into
India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting
for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal
agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting
frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and
strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint
for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral
frameworks.

Method: 开发了区间二型贝叶斯定理版本，使用保守方法避免输入不一致性；提出了将专家区间编码为二型模糊隶属函数的灵活算法。

Result: 成功扩展了贝叶斯定理到区间二型版本，能够处理区间输入概率并产生有效输出结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理现实世界中的不确定性提供了更实用的贝叶斯推断框架，特别适用于专家提供区间估计的场景。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Result: 在编译成功率、GDD遵循度、最佳实践采用和代码模块性等指标上显著超过现有LLM，平均得分4.8/5.0分

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了AI辅助游戏开发的关键问题，使LLM成为从游戏设计向实现迅速迁移的价值工具

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large
Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an end-to-end system that parses GDDs,
extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game
design to implementation.

TL;DR: 使用多个专门的LLM模型代理分解MiniZinc建模任务，通过不同约束类型的分工合作，提高了自然语言描述转换为约束满足模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述向MiniZinc约束满足模型的转换需要逻辑推理和约束编程专业知识，这是一项具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 采用多代理架构，每个专门的LLM代理负责检测和生成特定类型的全局约束代码，最后由一个组装代理整合成完整的MiniZinc模型。

Result: 初步实验显示，该方法在多个LLM上都表现出比基线方法（如一次提示和思维链提示）更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过任务分解和专门化的多代理方案，可以有效处理复杂的MiniZinc建模任务，并为未来工作提供了完整的发展路线图。

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成数据在训练中的比例不断增加，重复训练合成数据会导致模型崩溃现象，现有缓解策略有限，需要新的方法来保持生成模型的质量

Method: 识别模型对自生成数据的过度自信是崩溃的关键驱动因素，提出置信度感知的损失函数TCE，在训练中降低高置信度预测的权重

Result: TCE显著延迟了递归训练中的模型崩溃，理论分析和实证验证表明可将模型崩溃前的高保真度区间延长2.3倍以上，且方法具有跨模态通用性

Conclusion: 损失函数设计为在合成数据时代保持生成模型质量提供了简单而强大的工具，通过控制模型置信度可有效缓解模型崩溃问题

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Motivation: 虽然可解释AI已被广泛研究，但不确定性解释和全局解释这两个领域相对较少被关注。研究者希望构建通用的XAI指导方针，并特别关注这些被忽视的方面。

Method: 选择了一个能够同时涵盖不确定性、鲁棒性和全局XAI等多个概念的算法，测试其在信任校准方面的能力，并检查提供直观视觉理解的算法是否能提高用户满意度和人类可解释性。

Result: 研究发现，尽管某些算法在理解上较为复杂，但旨在提供更直观视觉理解的算法确实能够提供更高的用户满意度和人类可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在可解释AI系统中提供直观可视化理解的重要性，特别是在不确定性解释和全局解释方面，这有助于提高用户信任和满意度。

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文条件提示的方法来优化大语言模型在冷启动推荐任务中的表现，通过最优样本注入和指令结构化显著提升了few-shot设置下的推荐精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中冷启动用户因缺乏历史行为信息而导致推荐效果下降的问题，探索如何通过提示工程优化大语言模型在低数据环境下的推荐性能。

Method: 提出上下文条件提示公式P(u, Ds)→R̂，其中u是冷启动用户画像，Ds是精选支持集，R̂是预测的物品排序列表。使用基于transformer的自回归大语言模型（BioGPT、LLaMA-2、GPT-4），采用token级对齐和嵌入空间正则化技术。

Result: 实验证明最优样本注入和指令结构化能显著提升precision@k和NDCG分数，提示组合不仅具有语法意义，还能通过控制注意力尺度和解码器行为来影响推理过程。

Conclusion: 基于提示的适应方法可以视为解决基于大语言模型的推荐系统中冷启动问题的一种有效途径，特别是在低数据设置下表现出色。

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Motivation: 随着协调任务趋向自治组代理执行，需要评估代理在动态多治理者环境中的协商过程，而不仅仅是结果性能。不同类型代理（统计模型与LLM）各有优势，需要在相同条件下进行直接比较。

Method: 在动态协商环境中对人类（N=216）、LLM（GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro）和贝叶斯代理进行直接比较，捕获结果和行为动态。

Result: 贝叶斯代理通过突出的优化获得最高余额，但拒绝率高；LLM与人类能达到相似的总体余额，但行为模式存在根本差异：LLM偏向保守进退，人类更具战略性、冒险性和公平性。

Conclusion: 绩效平等作为代理评估标准可能隐藏了过程和对齐方面的根本差异，这些差异对于实际部署至关重要。

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Motivation: 当前自主AI系统在空间推理能力上存在显著缺口，主要限于符号和序列处理，而人类空间智能则基于多感官知觉、空间记忆和认知地图，能够在非结构化环境中进行灵活的上下文感知决策。缩小这一差距对于提升自主系统与物理世界的交互能力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Conclusion: ProgD方法通过动态异构图和渐进多尺度解码有效解决了多智能体运动预测中交互关系动态演化的问题，显著提升了预测准确性

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2

domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLM在数据科学任务中的多步推理能力和工具使用效果，展现出良好的泛化性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Conclusion: TAM Bench提供了一个多样化、真实且结构化的基准测试，能够更全面地评估基于LLM的自动机器学习代理在端到端ML工作流程中的能力，填补了现有基准测试的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Conclusion: TORSO提供了一种有效的方法来激发LLM的内在推理能力，无需依赖成本高昂的少样本提示构建，具有广泛适用性

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

Method: SEDM整合了基于可重现重放的可验证写入准入、根据经验效用动态排序和整合条目的自调度内存控制器，以及抽象可重用见解以支持跨异构任务迁移的跨域知识扩散。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估表明，SEDM相比强内存基线提高了推理准确性并降低了token开销，还能将从事实验证中提炼的知识增强多跳推理。

Conclusion: SEDM是一个可扩展且可持续的内存机制，适用于开放式的多智能体协作，代码将在项目后期发布。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

Motivation: 组合泛化是人类认知的关键能力，但现有AI工具如视觉语言模型缺乏这种能力。量子模型训练效率更高，可能提升组合泛化性能

Method: 在希尔伯特空间中解释组合张量模型的表示，使用变分量子电路学习这些表示。采用两种图像编码技术：多热编码(MHE)和CLIP模型的角/幅度编码

Result: 使用噪声MHE编码获得良好的概念验证结果。在CLIP图像向量上表现不一，但仍优于经典组合模型

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化任务中显示出潜力，特别是在特定编码方案下表现优于经典方法，为量子AI在组合推理中的应用提供了初步证据

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency

effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and

Conclusion: 聚焦执行能力可以解释LLMs在复杂推理和简单长任务中的表现差异，模型规模和顺序测试时计算对长视野任务有巨大益处，自我条件效应不能仅通过扩大模型规模来解决。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

*Luca Giuliani,Michele Lombardi*

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Conclusion: 该框架为不确定性量化提供了更直观的方法，有助于高风险应用中的决策制定，同时为理解集成模型行为提供了新视角

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

Conclusion: ReBaNO算法通过创新的网络结构和知识蒸馏技术，为多输入PDE组的求解提供了高效、精确且具有严格离散不变性的解决方案，在算子学习领域取得了显著进展。

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis
Neural Operator (ReBaNO), to solve a group of PDEs with multiple distinct
inputs. Inspired by the Reduced Basis Method and the recently introduced
Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,
and CNO, numerical results demonstrate that ReBaNO significantly outperforms
them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

*Weiyuan Gong,Tongyang Li,Xinzhao Wang,Zhiyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了矩阵乘性权重更新(MMWU)算法的改进版本，在矩阵学习专家建议问题中实现了实例最优的遗憾界，计算复杂度与原始MMWU相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MMWU算法在矩阵版本的LEA问题上只能达到极小极大最优的遗憾界，但无法实现实例最优性能。本文旨在开发一个既能保持相同计算复杂度又能获得更好遗憾界的算法。

Method: 首先建立了矩阵LEA的通用基于势能的框架，然后通过拉普拉斯变换技术开发了新的"单边"Jensen迹不等式，最后使用从向量LEA问题中获得的最优势函数（基于虚误差函数）来推导算法。

Result: 新算法实现了O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))的实例最优遗憾界，其中S(·||·)是量子相对熵，同时保持了与MMWU相同的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该算法在量子学习理论中表现出优越性能，能够有效处理退极化噪声、随机量子态和Gibbs态的学习问题，并能预测非线性量子特性如纯度、量子虚拟冷却和Rényi-2关联。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

### [124] [Corruption-Tolerant Asynchronous Q-Learning with Near-Optimal Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08933)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对抗性腐败环境下鲁棒的Q-learning算法，能够在部分奖励被恶意篡改时仍保持收敛性，收敛速率与非对抗情况相近，仅增加与腐败样本比例相关的可避免项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法在奖励信号遭受对抗性腐败（如极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击）时性能严重下降，需要开发能够抵抗此类干扰的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出新的鲁棒Q-learning变体，在异步采样模型下处理时间相关数据，使用改进的Azuma-Hoeffding不等式分析无先验知识情况。

Result: 算法在对抗性腐败下仍能实现有限时间收敛，收敛速率与非对抗情况匹配，仅增加与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项，且该附加项是信息理论下不可避免的。

Conclusion: 这是首个为异步Q-learning提供有限时间鲁棒性保证的工作，填补了鲁棒强化学习领域的重要空白，所提出的技术工具可能具有独立价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

Result: 在真实世界数据上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理群体分布不确定性，提升模型在最差群体上的性能表现

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

Motivation: 分析LRP型归因方法的数值特性，通过矩阵表示建立与链式法则的类比，研究归因值的分布特性，为多数据增强和Smoothgrad型方法提供理论依据。

Method: 将LRP归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积，推导奇异值上界和分量界限，应用这些界限获得控制经验均值收敛的乘法常数。

Result: 获得了控制归因图期望值收敛的乘法常数，发现LRP-beta的常数与权重范数无关，这与梯度方法和LRP-epsilon形成显著区别。

Conclusion: 该分析对多非几何数据增强和Smoothgrad型归因方法有重要影响，LRP-beta的权重范数无关特性为其提供了独特优势。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: 碳感知调度能够有效减少联邦学习的碳排放，同时保持模型准确性，为可持续机器学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Motivation: 标准Transformer虽然具有模拟大规模并行计算(MPC)算法的表示能力，但其二次时间复杂度严重限制了可扩展性，需要开发更高效的注意力机制。

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) algorithms, but they suffer from quadratic time
complexity, which severely limits their scalability. We introduce an efficient
attention mechanism called Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with
sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 在多个表格数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法超过了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 上下文在准确区分异常与正常实例中具有重要作用，提出的框架有效解决了异质性上下文带来的挑战。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

TL;DR: 通过混合专家(MoWE)方法，动态结合现有天气预测模型的输出，以更低计算成本获得更高准确度的预测结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动天气模型进展遍平台期，需要新方法突破现有限制，而非重新开发新预测器

Method: 使用Vision Transformer基础的门控网络，根据预测时效动态学习多个专家模型在每个格点的权重分配

Result: 在2天预测范围内，正方根误差(RMSE)比最佳AI天气模型降低10%，显著超过单个专家模型和简单平均结果

Conclusion: 提出了一种计算效率高、可扩展的策略，通过最大化利用现有高质量预测模型来推动数据驱动天气预测的发展

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Motivation: 可再生能源和分布式能源的集成改变了现代电力系统，对传统保护方案提出了挑战，需要评估机器学习技术在这一领域的应用潜力和现状。

Method: 采用PRISMA范围综述框架，对100多篇出版物进行系统分析，建立了机器学习导向的保护任务分类法，解决了术语不一致问题，并制定了标准化报告实践指南。

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

*Chaeyun Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRIDE是一个可扩展的XAI框架，通过RKHS中的正交函数分解避免特征子集枚举，提供功能组件而非单一标量归因，在表格数据上实现3倍加速和高保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有XAI框架的两个主要限制：特征子集枚举的指数级计算成本和将解释效果简化为单一标量值的表达力不足问题。

Method: 基于再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)的正交函数分解方法，通过递归核中心化程序的分析投影方案计算功能组件f_S(x_S)，避免显式子集枚举。

Result: 在10个数据集上实现中位数约3倍的加速(0.6-9.7倍范围)，保持高保真度(R^2在0.81-0.999之间)，并在大多数数据集上具有显著的排序一致性。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过提供结构化功能视角补充了标量归因方法，支持新颖的诊断功能如'组件手术'来量化特定交互作用的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Motivation: 机器学习中选择泛化能力好的模型具有挑战性，Rashomon效应指多个模型在相同学习问题上表现相似的情况，这在制造过程和医疗诊断等现实场景中常见，需要利用这种多样性来改善泛化性能

Method: 提出Rashomon Ensemble方法，基于模型性能和解释对模型进行分组，构建最大化多样性同时保持预测准确性的集成，确保每个模型覆盖解决方案空间的不同区域

Result: 在开放和专有协作现实数据集上验证，在Rashomon比例大的场景中AUROC提升可达0.20+，在各种实际应用中展示了稳健性、实用性和有效性

Conclusion: Rashomon Ensemble方法通过策略性选择多样化高性能模型构建集成，显著提高了模型在分布偏移和未见数据变化情况下的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法对所有增量矩阵使用统一的秩分配，而现有的秩分配技术计算效率低、复杂且不稳定，限制了在实际应用中的效果。

Method: 提出Sensitivity-LoRA方法，利用损失函数的二阶导数（Hessian矩阵）来捕捉权重敏感度，基于全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，实现最优秩分配且计算开销最小。

Result: 实验结果表明，Sensitivity-LoRA在不同任务和基准测试中都表现出强大的有效性、效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA通过动态秩分配解决了LoRA方法的局限性，为资源受限环境下的LLM专业化微调提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统的相关性学习模型无法区分真实因果关系和偏偏相关，限制了模型的稳健性、可解释性和通用性

Method: 集成多元格兰杰因果性(MVGC)和PCMCI+算法进行因果特征选择，并将其与混合神经网络架构相结合，使用1979-2021年北极海冰范围数据和海洋-大气变量

Conclusion: 该因果性框架不仅在北极海冰预测中表现优异，还可应用于其他动态高维预测领域，为因果性预测模型提供了可扩展的方法

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以处理高频或非规则时间间隔的复杂动态系统，连续时间RL虽然有望解决但局限于单智能体领域，主要受维度灾难和多智能体集中值函数近似困难的限制

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)近似HJB值函数，引入值梯度迭代(VGI)模块通过沿轨迹迭代优化值梯度来确保值与微分结构的一致性

Result: 在连续时间版本的多智能体粒子环境和多智能体MuJoCo基准测试中，该方法 consistently优于现有连续时间RL基线，并能扩展到复杂多智能体动态系统

Conclusion: 提出的CT-MARL框架成功解决了连续时间多智能体强化学习中的关键挑战，通过PINNs和VGI模块实现了在复杂多智能体系统中的有效学习和扩展

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化对等伙伴选择可以提高全球互联网生态系统的效率，解决传统手动选择过程长期复杂的问题

Method: 使用PeeringDB、CAIDA等公开数据库收集ISP数据，评估树基、神经网络和Transformer三类机器学习模型在预测对等关系中的性能

Result: XGBoost树基模型表现最佳，达到98%的预测准确率，并且对时间、空间和数据缺失都显示出良好的弹性

Conclusion: 该方法可以帮助ISP完全自动化对等伙伴选择过程，促进更高效和优化的互联网生态系统

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前零样本语音克隆和文本转语音技术发展迅速，虽然已有大量英语和中文的检测器，但全球超过6亿人使用的西班牙语在语音取证领域代表性不足，需要专门的检测数据集。

Method: 构建HISPASpoof数据集，包含来自公共语料库的6种口音的真实语音，以及使用6种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音。评估了5种代表性检测方法在西班牙语上的性能。

Result: 研究发现基于英语训练的检测器无法泛化到西班牙语，而在HISPASpoof上训练能显著提升检测性能。同时评估了合成语音溯源（识别生成方法）的性能。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为推进西班牙语可靠和包容性语音取证提供了关键基准，填补了该语言在语音伪造检测领域的空白。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

TL;DR: FSPO是一种序列级强化学习方法，通过在重要性采样权重空间实施长度公平裁剪来解决PPO/GRPO方法在序列长度处理上的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列级RL方法在移植PPO/GRPO式裁剪时存在固定裁剪范围对长短响应进行系统性重加权的问题，扭曲了有效目标函数。

Method: 提出FSPO方法，采用高斯动机的解决方案：用KL校正漂移项和√L缩放的带对序列对数IS比率进行裁剪。

Result: FSPO在不同长度区间内平整了裁剪率，稳定了训练过程，并在多个评估数据集上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FSPO通过理论形式化的长度公平性和实用的裁剪策略，有效解决了序列级RL中的长度偏差问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

Conclusion: DART框架系统性解决了深度学习天气模型的统计相似性陷阱问题，通过专门设计显著提升极端天气事件检测能力，为可信人工智能在极端天气预防中的应用探索了新路径。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

TL;DR: 提出IP3O算法，通过自适应激励机制和渐进惩罚策略解决约束强化学习中的边界稳定性问题，在连续控制任务中实现更好的约束满足和性能表现


<details>

Motivation: 约束强化学习在连续控制环境中面临奖励最大化与约束满足之间的平衡挑战，传统策略优化方法在约束边界附近表现不稳定，导致训练性能不佳

Method: 提出增量惩罚近端策略优化(IP3O)算法，集成自适应激励机制，在接近约束边界前施加渐进增加的惩罚来稳定训练动态

Result: 在基准环境上的实证评估显示，IP3O相比最先进的安全RL算法表现出更好的性能，同时提供了最坏情况误差的理论保证

Conclusion: IP3O算法通过创新的自适应惩罚机制有效解决了约束RL中的边界稳定性问题，为安全关键应用提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine

Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and

Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构化状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题，需要能够处理不同规模和结构的归纳策略方法。

Method: 将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，转换为二分图，通过神经消息传递映射到潜在状态，使用监督学习和强化学习训练策略。

Result: 在8个RDDL问题域的测试中，Vejde策略平均能够泛化到测试实例而不会显著损失分数，在未见测试实例上的得分接近实例特定的MLP代理。

Conclusion: Vejde框架成功展示了结合数据抽象、图神经网络和强化学习的方法能够有效生成可泛化的归纳策略，适用于结构化决策问题。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架能够有效提取无标签数据中的故障特征，具有高效率和高精度的少样本故障诊断能力，适用于多种机械设备的跨设备故障诊断

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和DeepSearch三个挑战性任务上的实验表明，EMPG实现了显著的性能提升，大幅优于强策略梯度基线方法

Conclusion: EMPG通过解耦策略梯度幅度与熵的关系，有效解决了LLM在稀疏奖励环境中的学习效率问题，为长时任务中的信用分配提供了新思路

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Conclusion: MoSE提供了灵活且表达力强的子图表示学习框架，在多种图任务中具有优异性能和可解释性。

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX框架有效解决了AutoML中的超参数优化问题，显著降低了计算成本并提高了效率，同时保持了竞争性的性能表现

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot
hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,
and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with
SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8

Result: LLMs生成的反事实解释通常有效但远非最小化，而要求最小化时又往往修改过少无法改变预测，存在明显的有效性-最小性权衡

Conclusion: 自生成反事实解释作为可解释性工具效果有限甚至可能产生误导，在关键应用部署LLMs时必须考虑不可靠自解释对下游决策的影响

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

Motivation: 机器学习和地统计学在土壤属性预测中各有优势但方法不同，需要一种能够同时利用空间结构和环境特征关系的综合方法。

Method: 使用普通克里金法生成'空间滞后'特征来丰富机器学习模型，提出Kriging prior regression (KpR)方法，采用TabPFN模型在六个田间尺度数据集上进行评估。

Result: KpR与TabPFN组合相比其他空间技术和非空间ML算法，提供了更可靠的不确定性估计和更准确的预测，平均R2提高了约30%。

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN是一个强大且通用的数字土壤制图框架，特别适用于样本量小的精准农业场景，能够补偿近端土壤传感数据有限时的弱关系问题。

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

Motivation: 传统微生物共现网络推断算法通常只分析单一环境中的静态关联，忽略了微生物群落在不同生态条件下的动态适应过程，需要开发能够捕捉跨环境动态关联的新方法。

Method: 提出了Same-All Cross-validation (SAC)验证框架，并开发了fuser算法，该算法在训练时保留特定子样本信号的同时跨环境共享相关信息，生成环境特异性的预测网络。

Conclusion: fuser算法能够有效捕捉微生物群落在不同环境中的动态关联模式，为微生物生态学研究提供了更准确的跨环境网络推断工具。

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Result: 在LausanneCity数据集上实现最先进性能，仅使用内源变量时表现优异，加入外源变量和预报后性能进一步提升；在三个大规模合成数据集上验证了模型的泛化性和可扩展性

Conclusion: AquaCast模型能够稳健准确地进行预测，在真实和合成数据集上一致优于现有基线方法，证明了其在城市水动力学预测中的有效性

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

Result: 证明具有次线性收敛速率，在多种数据集上显著提高了准确性同时保持隐私

Conclusion: D2P2-SGD通过动态隐私和投影技术，为大规模模型提供了效率更高、性能更好的隐私保护解决方案

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Conclusion: PIPES克服了OpenML的局限性，提供了更全面和多样化的实验数据，支持元学习社区进行更有效的算法选择研究，并具有进一步扩展的潜力

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗诊断中标记数据有限的问题，探索小样本学习在呼吸音分类中的有效性，特别是针对COVID-19、流感和健康状态的咳嗽声检测。

Method: 使用原型网络(Prototypical Networks)结合咳嗽声的频谱图表示，每个类别仅使用15个支持样本进行小样本学习，比较多类别和二分类模型的性能。

Result: 多类别分类达到74.87%准确率，二分类在所有类别对上都超过70%准确率。统计测试显示多类别和二分类模型性能无显著差异(p=0.149, p=0.125)，流感最易区分，健康状态最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 小样本学习在医疗诊断中具有可行性，特别是在缺乏大规模标记数据集的情况下，多类别分类模型可以达到与二分类模型相当的性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

Result: 在多种场景下优于现有防御方法，特别是在非IID数据分布时仍能保持强大的防御能力和模型准确性

Conclusion: 双视角方法在拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习中具有显著效果，能够有效处理数据异构环境下的安全挑战

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Conclusion: 该框架通过同时增强节点区分度和强制几何一致性，有效解决了无监督图对齐中的关键挑战，并在多个领域展现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Conclusion: 该深度学习仿真器能够高效探索参数空间，提供计算加速和不确定性量化，为研究罕见事件的统计特性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Result: 该方法能够揭示模型决策边界和底层逻辑的结构性变化，区分不同根本原因（如空间数据漂移vs概念重新标记）

Conclusion: 提出的整体视角能够更全面地诊断概念漂移，为理解模型决策逻辑的变化提供了可解释的代理方法

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转方法使用固定的Hadamard变换无法适应不同Transformer层的特定异常值模式，导致2位量化时性能严重下降。

Method: 提出可学习的蝴蝶变换，通过连续Givens旋转角度参数化，保证正交性同时支持梯度优化；引入均匀性正则化促进量化友好的分布。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B模型上，2位量化时困惑度达到15.4，相比QuaRot的22.1有显著提升；仅需128个校准样本和单GPU几分钟训练。

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant通过层自适应的可学习正交变换，有效解决了极端量化中的异常值问题，为在消费级硬件上部署大语言模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过大规模实验对比了AI搜索和传统搜索引擎的信息源偏好，提出了生成式引擎优化(GEO)新概念，为实践者提供了具体的可见性提升策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT、Perplexity、Gemini等生成式AI搜索引擎的快速普及，信息检索模式从传统排名列表转向综合性答案，对SEO实践构成挑战，需要探索新的优化方法。

Method: 进行大规模、受控实验，涵盖多个垂直领域、语言和查询重写，定量分析AI搜索和Google在信息源选择上的关键差异。

Result: 发现AI搜索系统存在系统性偏见：偏好第三方权威来源(Earned media)，而非品牌自有内容或社交内容，与Google更均衡的源分布形成明显对比。同时不同AI搜索服务在域多样性、新鲜度、跨语言稳定性和语气敏感度方面存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 提出了GEO战略议程，建议实践者：(1)优化内容机器可扫描性和证据支撑性；(2)控制第三方媒体建立AI权威感；(3)采用引擎特定和语言敏感策略；(4)应对大品牌偏见以支持小众玩家。为生成式搜索新市场提供了基础性实证分析和战略框架。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the
new generative search landscape.

been used as fairness concepts in the economics, game theory, and social choice
literatures since the 1960s, and have recently gained popularity within the
recommendation systems communities. In this short position paper we will give
an overview of envy-freeness and its use in economics and recommendation
systems; and illustrate why envy is not appropriate to measure fairness for use
in settings where personalization plays a role.

### [175] [Modality Alignment with Multi-scale Bilateral Attention for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09114)
*Kelin Ren,Chan-Yang Ju,Dong-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MambaRec是一个新颖的多模态推荐框架，通过注意力引导学习整合局部特征对齐和全局分布正则化，解决了现有方法在细粒度跨模态关联建模和全局一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推荐系统主要依赖静态融合策略或基于图的局部交互建模，存在两个关键局限：(1) 细粒度跨模态关联建模能力不足，导致融合质量欠佳；(2) 缺乏全局分布级别一致性，造成表示偏差。

Method: 提出MambaRec框架，核心是扩张细化注意力模块(DREAM)，使用多尺度扩张卷积结合通道和空间注意力来对齐视觉和文本模态的细粒度语义模式。同时应用最大均值差异(MMD)和对比损失函数约束全局模态对齐。采用降维策略降低高维多模态特征的计算成本。

Result: 在真实电商数据集上的大量实验表明，MambaRec在融合质量、泛化能力和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MambaRec通过局部特征对齐和全局分布正则化的双重机制，有效提升了多模态推荐系统的性能，为解决跨模态语义建模和表示一致性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly becoming foundational
technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized
services by jointly modeling users' historical behaviors and the multimodal
features of items (e.g., visual and textual). However, most existing methods
rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction
modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model
fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality;
and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing
representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework
that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization
via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement
Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with
channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns
between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical
relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic
modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive
loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic
consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and
boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality
reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets
show that MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality,
generalization, and efficiency. Our code has been made publicly available at
https://github.com/rkl71/MambaRec.

*Yifan Wang,Shen Gao,Jiabao Fang,Rui Yan,Billy Chiu,Shuo Shang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CESRec是一个新颖的推荐框架，将序列推荐系统的长期偏好建模与会话推荐系统的实时偏好获取相结合，通过语义伪交互构建和双重对齐异常项掩码来提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列推荐方法依赖协同过滤信号但无法捕捉实时用户偏好，而会话推荐系统擅长获取即时兴趣但忽略历史行为，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出语义伪交互构建动态更新用户历史交互序列，生成结合长期和实时偏好的伪交互序列；使用双重对齐异常项掩码识别和掩码偏离用户核心偏好的历史项目。

Result: 大量实验表明CESRec通过增强强大的SRS模型实现了最先进的性能，验证了其将会话反馈整合到SRS中的有效性。

Conclusion: CESRec成功整合了序列推荐和会话推荐的优点，为推荐系统提供了同时考虑长期历史行为和实时交互偏好的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRS) have become essential in many
real-world applications. However, existing SRS methods often rely on
collaborative filtering signals and fail to capture real-time user preferences,
while Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) excel at eliciting immediate
interests through natural language interactions but neglect historical
behavior. To bridge this gap, we propose CESRec, a novel framework that
integrates the long-term preference modeling of SRS with the real-time
preference elicitation of CRS. We introduce semantic-based pseudo interaction
construction, which dynamically updates users'historical interaction sequences
by analyzing conversational feedback, generating a pseudo-interaction sequence
that seamlessly combines long-term and real-time preferences. Additionally, we
reduce the impact of outliers in historical items that deviate from users'core
preferences by proposing dual alignment outlier items masking, which identifies
and masks such items using semantic-collaborative aligned representations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CESRec achieves state-of-the-art
performance by boosting strong SRS models, validating its effectiveness in
integrating conversational feedback into SRS.

*Alan Said,Maria Soledad Pera,Michael D. Ekstrand*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文回顾了2011年Amatriain对推荐系统研究的批评，指出该领域在概念、认识论和基础设施方面的问题依然存在，并呼吁进行根本性的范式转变，建立基于认识谦逊、人类影响和可持续实践的推荐系统研究议程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统研究虽然技术复杂度不断提升，但基础方法论问题仍未解决，需要重新审视研究目的、服务对象和知识生产方式。

Method: 通过分析可重复性研究、评估方法学、环境影响和参与式设计等最新工作，展示领域复杂性已超越自省能力，并强调社区主导的范式转变倡议。

Result: 研究发现推荐系统研究中的概念性、认识论和基础设施问题以更微妙或系统性的形式持续存在，需要根本性的重新框架。

Conclusion: 有意义的变革不仅需要新指标或更好工具，更需要重新定义推荐系统研究的目的、服务对象和知识生产验证方式，建立基于认识谦逊、人类影响和可持续实践的研究议程。

Abstract: In 2011, Xavier Amatriain sounded the alarm: recommender systems research was
"doing it all wrong" [1]. His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation
and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But
rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of
the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and
argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural
failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing
on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental
impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating
complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led
initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation
frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the
same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics
or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems
research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated.
Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems
research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable
practice.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 通过提高负样本质量和批处理效率来改善多语言密集检索的数据利用率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言密集检索的挑战在于在共享向量空间中对齐不同语言的表示，现有方法效果受限于负样本质量和批处数据效果

Method: 提出一种方法来获得高质量的确定性负样本和高效的批处数据，以提高数据利用率

Result: 在包含16种语言的MIRACL多语言检索基准上，方法表现超过多个现有强基线模型

Conclusion: 通过提高数据质量和效率的方法可以有效提升多语言密集检索的性能，而不需要复杂的模型架构

Abstract: Multilingual dense retrieval aims to retrieve relevant documents across
different languages based on a unified retriever model. The challenge lies in
aligning representations of different languages in a shared vector space. The
common practice is to fine-tune the dense retriever via contrastive learning,
whose effectiveness highly relies on the quality of the negative sample and the
efficacy of mini-batch data. Different from the existing studies that focus on
developing sophisticated model architecture, we propose a method to boost data
utilization for multilingual dense retrieval by obtaining high-quality hard
negative samples and effective mini-batch data. The extensive experimental
results on a multilingual retrieval benchmark, MIRACL, with 16 languages
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming several existing
strong baselines.

TL;DR: 这项研究分析了Reddit社区AskDoc的在线医生咨询服务，发现该平台上成年白人男性占主导地位，且医生参与度较低，存在某些人口统计学特征的差异性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线医生咨询服务是否反映了现实医疗体系中存在的障碍和偏见，特别是在不同人口统计学组之间的差异。

Method: 从2020年1月到2022年5月下载AskDoc子红板数据，使用正则表达式识别自我报告的人口统计学特征（性别、种族、年龄），并进行统计分析了同伴和医生与发帖者之间的互动。

Result: 一半的帖子没有收到评论；90%以上用户曝露性别和年龄，80%不曝露种族；子红板以成年白人男性为主；某些人口统计学特征的发帖者在互动中存在差异；医生参与度较低。

Conclusion: 社交媒体可能缩短病人与提供者之间的距离，但目前医生参与度低，并且存在与人口统计学特征相关的差异性问题。

Abstract: The objective of this study is to understand the online Ask the Doctor
services medical advice on internet platforms via AskDoc, a Reddit community
that serves as a public AtD platform and study if platforms mirror existing
hurdles and partiality in healthcare across various demographic groups. We
downloaded data from January 2020 to May 2022 from AskDoc -- a subreddit, and
created regular expressions to identify self-reported demographics (Gender,
Race, and Age) from the posts, and performed statistical analysis to understand
the interaction between peers and physicians with the posters. Half of the
posts did not receive comments from peers or physicians. At least 90% of the
people disclose their gender and age, and 80% of the people do not disclose
their race. It was observed that the subreddit is dominated by adult (age group
20-39) white males. Some disparities were observed in the engagement between
the users and the posters with certain demographics. Beyond the confines of
clinics and hospitals, social media could bring patients and providers closer
together, however, as observed, current physicians participation is low
compared to posters.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在无线电规章领域的问题回答，提出了一种专门的RAG流程，在精准检索下对GPT-4o等模型实现了12%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线电规章是一个法律敏感且高风险的领域，需要高准确性的问题回答系统，以避免法律风险。

Method: 提出了一种电信特定的RAG流程，构建了首个多选题评估集，并定义了领域特定的检索指标。

Result: 检索器达到了97%的准确率，整体流程对所有测试模型都有显著改善，对GPT-4o实现了12%的相对提升。

Conclusion: 细致的领域知识埋入提供了一种简单但有效的解决方案，为规章问答领域建立了强大的基准线。

Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally
sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge,
the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from
authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess
retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which
our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our
approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In
particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline
results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that
carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an
effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code
and evaluation scripts, along with our derived question-answer dataset, are
available at https://github.com/Zakaria010/Radio-RAG.
