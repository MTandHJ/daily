### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成-真实数据权重平衡，解决了小目标和标注数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB标注数据有限的挑战，需要开发能够在实际环境中实时运行且鲁棒的检测系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR架构，结合多尺度特征融合模块增强小目标检测，不确定性最小化查询选择聚焦可靠提案，合成与真实数据权重策略减少域间差异，并应用数据增强平衡类别。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测流水线，保持实时性能，验证了各模块贡献及系统在极端光照和海况下的处理能力。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度与精度平衡，为海上目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DynamicEval基准，专注于动态相机运动的文本到视频评估，包含4.5万个人工标注和新的背景一致性、前景一致性指标，在视频级和模型级评估中比现有方法提升2%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准存在两个局限：忽视动态相机运动的重要性，以及将视频级评分过度聚合为模型级评分，忽略了视频级评估的重要性。

Method: 构建包含动态相机运动提示的基准，收集4.5万个人工标注；提出新的背景一致性指标（基于物体错误图修正遮挡问题）和前景一致性指标（通过跟踪物体实例内的点来评估物体保真度）。

Result: 实验表明，提出的指标在视频级和模型级评估中与人类偏好相关性更强，相比现有方法提升超过2个百分点。

Conclusion: DynamicEval为动态相机运动下的T2V模型评估提供了更全面的基准，新提出的指标能更好地评估背景场景一致性和前景物体一致性。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RISP方法，结合重启惯性和基于分数的图像先验，在解决病态成像逆问题时实现快速收敛和高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED主要关注设计复杂图像先验来提高重建质量，而收敛加速通常依赖启发式方法，缺乏理论保证。

Method: RISP方法在RED基础上引入重启惯性机制，同时保持基于分数的图像先验，并建立了相应的连续时间动力系统分析。

Result: 理论证明RISP比RED具有更快的驻点收敛速度，实验验证了在多种成像逆问题中实现快速收敛和高质量重建。

Conclusion: RISP为病态成像逆问题提供了具有理论保证的快速收敛方法，同时保持高质量重建能力。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于图像纯化策略的降噪框架，解决超低剂量CT图像中的噪声、伪影和空间不对齐问题，通过频域流匹配模型在真实临床数据集上实现最先进的解剖结构保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT显著减少辐射暴露但引入严重噪声和伪影，导致uLDCT与正常剂量CT图像对之间存在显著空间不对齐，现有降噪网络无法直接应用。

Method: 构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集，提出图像纯化策略生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对，并设计频域流匹配模型与IP策略协同工作。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上，IP策略显著提升多个主流降噪模型在uLDCT任务上的性能，FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保护方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 本研究为真实世界uLDCT降噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA是一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法，能够在不访问底层模型的情况下移除或削弱水印，通过在多维表示中投影到自然先验来抑制水印信号同时保持视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛使用，水印方法对于内容溯源和归属确认变得至关重要。然而现有的语义水印方案即使在资源受限的对抗环境下仍然存在脆弱性。

Method: 提出D2RA攻击方法，通过将带水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，在不访问原始模型的情况下抑制水印信号。该方法无需训练，仅需单张图像即可实施攻击。

Result: 在多种水印方案上的实验表明，D2RA能够持续降低水印可检测性，揭示了当前水印设计的基本弱点。

Conclusion: D2RA攻击揭示了现有水印方案的根本脆弱性，即使在没有模型访问权限的资源受限环境下，水印仍然可以被有效移除或削弱。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个视频风格转换框架，通过插入低秩适配器到预训练视频扩散模型中，利用成对静态图像数据进行训练，实现内容保持和风格转换的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格转换任务中缺乏配对视频数据监督的挑战，需要在保持输入视频内容的同时，根据文本提示渲染目标风格。

Method: 在条件模块的自注意力层插入低秩适配器，从成对图像构建合成训练剪辑以模拟相机运动，并引入上下文-风格分类器自由引导（CS-CFG）来独立控制内容和风格方向。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了时间一致、风格忠实且内容保持的视频转换，在定性和定量评估上都优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle框架通过有效的适配器设计和训练策略，成功解决了视频风格转换中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的视频风格迁移。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出TRAVL方法，通过平衡训练数据和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进视频语言模型对物理合理性的判断能力，并创建了ImplausiBench基准来评估模型的物理推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反物理规律的序列，但目前缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法。研究发现现有视频语言模型难以识别物理违规，暴露了其在时间和因果推理方面的局限性。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进运动编码和判别能力。同时提出ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频（150个真实，150个生成），消除语言偏见并隔离视觉-时间理解。

Result: TRAVL和ImplausiBench为多模态模型中的物理合理性提供了一个统一的探测和改进框架，揭示了视觉-时间理解中具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决视频生成模型中的物理不合理性问题提供了有效的方法和评估标准，推动了多模态模型在物理推理能力方面的发展。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义光谱-空间融合网络(S3FN)，通过结合文本描述来增强高光谱图像分类性能，解决了传统单模态模型在有限训练样本下的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临训练样本有限、数据维度高导致的过拟合问题，且现有模型多为单模态，仅依赖光谱空间数据。需要引入多模态信息来提升分类性能。

Method: 使用LLM生成类别特定的文本描述，通过BERT或RoBERTa等预训练文本编码器将描述嵌入向量空间，提取有意义的标签语义，实现更好的特征-标签对齐。

Result: 在三个高光谱基准数据集（Hyperspectral Wood、HyperspectralBlueberries、DeepHS-Fruit）上评估，报告了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 文本语义与光谱空间数据之间存在协同效应，为语义增强的高光谱图像分类模型的发展开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CAGUL框架，一种轻量级的视觉语言模型遗忘方法，通过跨模态注意力引导来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露私有敏感信息，现有遗忘方法主要针对文本模型，而视觉语言模型增加了视觉上下文的复杂性。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力分析视觉token在输出生成中的作用，通过外部模块在低重要性视觉token中编码遗忘信息，不改变预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验表明CAGUL方法优于或与基于微调的基线方法相当，能有效防止信息泄露并保持参考模型行为。

Conclusion: CAGUL为视觉语言模型提供了一种实用有效的遗忘解决方案，无需改变预训练参数或产生重新训练成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [VideoNorms: Benchmarking Cultural Awareness of Video Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08543)
*Nikhil Reddy Varimalla,Yunfei Xu,Arkadiy Saakyan,Meng Fan Wang,Smaranda Muresan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-社会规范对的数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，涵盖美国和中国文化，基于言语行为理论标注规范遵守和违反情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础能力，但目前缺乏合适的基准测试。

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建数据集：使用基于理论提示的教师模型生成候选标注，由训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。

Result: 基准测试显示：1）模型在规范违反检测上表现较差；2）对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；3）提供非语言证据比语言证据更困难；4）在正式非幽默语境中表现不如人类。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化基础视频语言模型训练的必要性，VideoNorms基准和框架为填补这一空白提供了开端。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

### [11] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaSC算法，使用轻量级YOLOv9模型从无人机RGB图像自动计数玉米植株，在两种模式下均与人工计数高度一致，具有实时处理潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工计数玉米植株耗时费力且易出错，特别是在大面积或变化大的田地中，需要自动化解决方案来支持作物管理和研究。

Method: 使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长期的玉米幼苗，区分杂草和其他植被，通过空间分布进行行和范围分割，提供精确的行级计数。

Result: 与2024年夏季苗圃实地人工计数相比，马赛克图像模式R²=0.616，原始视频帧模式R²=0.906，处理83帧全分辨率图像仅需60.63秒。

Conclusion: MaSC是一种可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米植株计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [12] [Detecting Legend Items on Historical Maps Using GPT-4o with In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08385)
*Sofia Kirsanova,Yao-Yi Chiang,Weiwei Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LayoutLMv3和GPT-4o的方法，用于自动检测和关联历史地图图例中的符号与描述，通过边界框预测实现结构化解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图图例对于解释地图符号至关重要，但其布局不一致和非结构化格式使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有方法主要关注分割或通用OCR，很少有方法能有效匹配图例符号与对应描述。

Method: 结合LayoutLMv3进行布局检测，使用GPT-4o通过上下文学习来检测和链接图例项及其描述，通过边界框预测实现结构化匹配。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4配合结构化JSON提示优于基线方法，达到88% F-1分数和85% IoU，并揭示了提示设计、示例数量和布局对齐对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，提高了各种视觉风格历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

### [13] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Quick-CapsNet（QCN）作为CapsNet的快速替代方案，通过减少胶囊数量实现5倍推理速度提升，但准确率略有下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet在检测重叠数字方面优于传统CNN，但对仿射变换具有更高鲁棒性，缺点是训练和测试速度慢，这限制了需要快速网络的实时应用

Method: 通过产生更少数量的胶囊来构建更快的网络，并采用更强大的解码器来进一步提升QCN性能

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上推理速度提高5倍，但准确率有轻微损失

Conclusion: QCN可以作为开发快速实时应用CapsNet的起点，在保持较高性能的同时显著提升速度

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [14] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++是一种自适应预测器-校正器引导方法，解决了标准CFG在整流流模型中的离流形漂移问题，通过几何感知条件规则确保轨迹稳定在数据流形附近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFG在整流流模型中会引起严重的离流形漂移，导致视觉伪影、文本不对齐和脆弱行为，需要一种更稳定的引导方法。

Method: 提出自适应预测器-校正器引导：先执行条件RF更新将样本锚定在学习的传输路径附近，然后应用加权条件校正，在条件和无条件速度场之间插值。

Result: 在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文本到图像模型上，Rectified-CFG++在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic和T2I-CompBench基准数据集上始终优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++将整流流的确定性效率与几何感知条件规则相结合，确保速度场的边际一致性，轨迹保持在数据流形的有界管状邻域内，在各种引导强度下保持稳定性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得进展，但在3D资产领域尚未充分探索。不同模态数据（文本描述、2D投影、3D点云视图）提供关于点云质量的互补信息。

Method: 构建PIT-QMM模型，能够端到端消费文本、图像和点云来预测质量分数，利用多模态信息的互补性。

Result: 在流行基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，训练迭代次数更少，同时支持失真定位和识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为模型可解释性和交互性开辟了新途径，在无参考点云质量评估方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有动作分割方法多为单流方法，主要关注帧序列的时空特征。本研究探索引入第二流动作特征来指导分割，捕捉动作和动作转换线索，提升分割性能。

Method: 提出Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net)，包含帧级流和动作级流，通过Temporal Context (TC)块融合信息，使用交叉注意力和量子驱动的动作引导调制(Q-ActGM)。引入Dual-Stream Alignment Loss包含关系一致性、跨层对比和循环一致性重建损失。

Conclusion: DSA Net通过双流特征对齐和混合量子-经典框架，成功提升了动作分割性能，证明了引入第二流动作特征和量子调制机制的有效性。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OIE方法，基于首帧服装替换的视频虚拟试穿策略，通过图像模型替换首帧服装，再利用内容控制生成剩余帧，实现参数和计算效率的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于U-Net的双分支架构难以适应Diffusion Transformer，引入服装参考分支特征需要修改主干网络导致参数过多，且服装特征缺乏时序特性需要额外学习。

Method: 使用图像服装替换模型处理首帧，在编辑后的首帧内容控制下，利用姿态和掩码信息引导视频生成模型顺序合成剩余帧。

Result: 实验表明该方法在参数效率和计算效率上表现优越，同时在约束条件下保持领先性能。

Conclusion: OIE方法通过首帧替换策略有效解决了双分支架构在Diffusion Transformer中的适应问题，实现了高效且性能优越的视频虚拟试穿。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

### [18] [MONKEY: Masking ON KEY-Value Activation Adapter for Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07656)
*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用IP-Adapter自动生成的掩码来改进个性化扩散模型的方法，通过在第二遍中掩码图像标记，使文本提示能够更好地控制背景，从而提高提示和源图像的对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化扩散模型在生成新图像时往往过度关注主体而忽略文本提示，导致生成的图像只是简单地重现主体图像，缺乏对文本提示的响应。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter在推理过程中自动生成的掩码，在第二遍处理中掩码图像标记，将主体限制在掩码区域内，让文本提示能够关注图像的其余部分。

Result: 对于描述位置和地点的文本提示，该方法能够生成准确描绘主体且与提示高度匹配的图像，相比其他测试时个性化方法显示出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过使用自动生成的掩码来限制主体区域，该方法有效地解决了个性化扩散模型中主体过度重现的问题，显著提高了文本提示的控制能力。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM

Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in
automated layout design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)解决金字塔网络中解剖结构错位累积问题，并使用双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定迭代次数，在多个医学图像数据集上达到最先进的配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中表现优异，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法自适应确定不同图像变形需求下的迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 1. 提出特征增强残差模块(FERM)作为金字塔网络解码层的核心组件，包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、抑制无关特征、估计最终变形场；2. 提出双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略，第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性。

Result: 在三个公共脑MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在准确性方面优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数大小。

Conclusion: TCIP模型有效解决了金字塔网络中的解剖错位累积和迭代次数自适应问题，FERM和TCI策略具有良好的通用性，可集成到现有配准网络中提升性能。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常针对固定输入格式训练，无法满足需要混合粒度控制（从精确轨迹到粗略文本）的视频工作流程需求。

Method: 将任务建模为变分推断问题，利用多个视频生成骨干网络共同处理所有任务约束。采用逐步KL散度最小化和上下文条件分解技术来优化求解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在可控性、多样性和3D一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为指定元素提供高可控性，同时为未指定元素保持多样性，解决了视频合成中的混合控制需求。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于中心的方法在捕获全局数据分布方面表现优异，但往往未能充分利用重要的局部相似性信息。为了解决这一局限性，需要一种能够结合两种方法优势的方案。

Method: 使用双分支结构：一个基于中心的强分支和一个基于成对的弱分支。通过迭代式相互学习过程，中心分支利用成对分支学到的局部相似性线索。还引入了混合哈希专家模块来实现有效的跨分支交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MLH始终优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH框架通过弱到强的知识转移和跨分支交互，成功结合了中心方法和成对方法的优势，在大规模图像检索任务中取得了卓越性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SyncHuman展示了将2D多视角生成和3D原生生成相结合的有效性，为未来3D生成模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅(GS)虽然能实现沉浸式渲染，但物体与场景的组合存在挑战，因为GS辐射场中的烘焙外观和阴影信息会导致不一致。需要可重光照的物体重建和场景光照估计来解决这个问题。

Method: 1) 引入表面八面体探针(SOPs)存储光照和遮挡信息，通过插值实现高效3D查询，避免昂贵的射线追踪；2) 通过360度重建场景辐射场，微调扩散模型完成光照估计；3) 提出ComGS框架整合这些技术。

Conclusion: ComGS框架通过SOPs和扩散模型光照估计，有效解决了高斯泼溅中物体-场景组合的挑战，实现了高质量、实时的3D对象-场景合成。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出一种结合低帧率RGB视频和高帧率事件流来重建动态3D高斯溅射的方法，通过事件运动先验指导变形场优化，解决大帧间运动带来的不确定性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低帧率RGB视频重建动态3DGS时，大帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机能异步捕捉快速视觉变化且抗运动模糊，但缺乏颜色信息。结合两种模态可以互补优势。

Method: 采用事件运动先验指导变形场优化：1) 使用LoCM无监督微调框架提取事件流中的运动先验；2) 提出几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系；3) 采用运动分解和帧间伪标签策略。

Result: 在合成和真实场景上的大量实验表明，该方法优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，证明事件数据能有效优化动态3DGS。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化RGB和事件模态，利用事件运动先验指导变形场，能够有效解决动态3DGS重建中的大帧间运动挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

TL;DR: 提出了GTR-Bench基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在大型摄像头网络中对移动目标的地理时空推理能力，发现现有模型表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空基准主要关注以自我为中心的图像/视频推理或基于图形的地理推理，缺乏结合图像/视频和图形上下文的地理时空智能评估，这对交通管理和应急响应等领域很重要。

Method: 构建GTR-Bench基准，要求模型在地图和视频之间进行多视角切换，跨多个非重叠视野视频进行联合推理，并对视频未观测到的时空区域进行推断。

Result: 评估10多个流行VLM显示，最佳专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro准确率仅34.9%，远低于人类表现78.61%。分析发现模型存在时空上下文利用不平衡、时间预测能力弱、地图与多视角视频理解对齐困难三大缺陷。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了有价值的见解和新机会，揭示了当前模型在地理时空推理方面的显著不足。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Conclusion: 可学习的双相框架在推进微表情识别方面具有潜力

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Motivation: 传统视觉提示方法存在表达能力受限和容易过拟合的问题，限制了其性能表现。

Method: 提出ACAVP方法，结合仿射变换（创建任务特定提示区域）、颜色变换（强调任务相关特征）和加法变换，并使用TrivialAugment数据增强来缓解过拟合。

Result: 在12个图像分类数据集上，ACAVP在视觉提示方法中达到最先进精度，平均准确率超过线性探测，对分布偏移具有更强鲁棒性，且推理时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换操作和有效数据增强，显著提升了视觉提示的性能，证明了适当的数据增强对所有视觉提示方法都有益。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: PrismGS是一个基于物理正则化的框架，通过金字塔多尺度监督和显式尺寸正则化，解决了3D高斯溅射在大规模城市场景中的混叠伪影和优化不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在大型城市场景中会出现严重的混叠伪影和优化不稳定问题，特别是在4K高分辨率渲染下，表现为闪烁纹理和锯齿边缘。现有方法虽然解决了可扩展性问题，但未能解决这种保真度差距。

Method: PrismGS集成了两个协同的正则化器：1）金字塔多尺度监督，通过监督渲染与预过滤图像金字塔的一致性，强制模型学习内在抗混叠表示；2）显式尺寸正则化，对3D高斯的尺寸施加物理基础的下界约束，防止形成退化的视图相关基元。

Result: 在MatrixCity、Mill-19和UrbanScene3D数据集上的广泛实验表明，PrismGS实现了最先进的性能，相比CityGaussian获得了约1.5 dB的PSNR增益，同时在苛刻的4K渲染下保持了优越的质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的兼容现有管道的框架，通过物理基础的正则化显著提高了3D高斯的渲染质量，解决了大规模城市场景中的混叠问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1

Motivation: 随着增强现实、虚拟现实和机器人应用对语义丰富3D模型需求的增长，从稀疏视图创建这些模型面临几何模糊的挑战。现有方法通常将语义视为被动特征，而本文认为语义理解应作为主动指导力量来增强稀疏视图重建的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MARC方法，通过检索增强强化学习实现视频token压缩，仅用1帧token达到接近基线精度，减少95%视觉token、72%GPU内存和23.9%延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从图像扩展到视频时面临高计算成本问题，现有免训练token压缩方法会导致信息丢失和性能下降。

Method: 采用检索后压缩策略：视觉记忆检索器选择关键片段，压缩组相对策略优化框架将教师模型的推理能力蒸馏到学生模型。

Result: 在6个视频基准测试中，仅使用1帧token就达到接近基线精度，视觉token减少95%，GPU内存减少72%，延迟降低23.9%。

Conclusion: MARC在资源受限环境下具有高效实时视频理解的潜力，适用于视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等场景。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Motivation: 异常检测在制造业质量控制中很重要，但受限于异常样本稀少和标注成本高。异常合成是解决方案，但现有研究缺乏对异常合成算法的系统评估，忽略了关键因素。

Method: 提出ASBench基准框架，包含四个评估维度：跨数据集和管道的泛化性能、合成与真实数据比例、合成图像内在指标与异常检测性能的相关性、混合异常合成策略。

Result: 通过大量实验，ASBench揭示了当前异常合成方法的局限性。

Conclusion: ASBench不仅识别了当前方法的不足，还为异常合成领域的未来研究提供了可行的见解和方向。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在组合场景（如运动、数量、空间关系）中表现不佳，需要改进文本-图像对齐能力。

Method: 采用测试时优化和记忆机制，通过布局注意力目标优化新参数，并使用参数化记忆机制维护历史优化上下文，支持插入、读取、更新和删除操作。

Result: TTOM能够解耦组合性世界知识，展现出强大的可迁移性和泛化能力，在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: TTOM是一个有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection

outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在不增加推理开销的情况下显著提升了降水临近预报的准确性，通过知识蒸馏和概率建模的结合有效解决了确定性预测的局限性。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

TL;DR: 提出Latent Harmony框架解决UHD图像修复中计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题，通过两阶段方法联合正则化潜在空间并强制高频感知重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE在UHD图像修复中因高斯约束会丢失退化特定高频信息，影响重建保真度，需要克服这一限制

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段LH-VAE通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性；第二阶段使用HF-LoRA（高频低秩适应）联合训练，包含保真导向的编码器LoRA和感知导向的解码器LoRA

Result: 在UHD和标准分辨率任务上达到最先进性能，有效平衡效率、感知质量和重建精度

Conclusion: Latent Harmony框架成功解决了UHD图像修复中的关键挑战，实现了计算效率与高频细节保留的良好平衡

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类中的有效性，发现在标签预算有限时抽象标签更有效，而当标签数量充足时对象标签同样有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哪种类型的标签更适合图像隐私这一上下文依赖且主观的任务，对象标签通常用于隐私分类，但抽象标签可能更有效。

Method: 通过比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类任务中的表现，分析不同标签数量下的效果差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；当每个图像有更多标签可用时，对象相关信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将指导未来研究开发更准确的图像隐私分类器，考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

Motivation: 解决低光照图像恢复中高频细节恢复与强噪声抑制的挑战，同时探索性能与计算效率之间的关键权衡，为实际应用提供更实用的解决方案。

Method: 将最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级卷积神经网络(CNN)在相同任务上进行对比实验，分析两者的训练效率、模型大小和性能表现。

Result: SwinIR达到最高性能(PSNR 39.03 dB)，但轻量级CNN表现出色(PSNR 37.4 dB)，且仅需10个训练周期(相比SwinIR的132周期)，模型大小小55倍以上。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能以显著更低的计算开销提供接近SOTA的结果，在资源受限的实际场景中具有明显优势。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有组合图像检索方法作为"黑盒"的局限性，缺乏可解释性和处理复杂指令的能力，需要更透明和细粒度的推理过程。

Method: 提出CIR-CoT模型，通过三阶段过程创建结构化思维链标注（描述、推理、结论），然后微调模型生成结构化输出，并将最终检索意图编码到专用嵌入中。

Result: 在领域内数据集（FashionIQ、CIRR）上达到高度竞争力表现，在领域外CIRCO数据集上展现出显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: CIR-CoT为构建更有效和可信赖的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过显式推理链实现了检索过程的透明化和准确性提升。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Conclusion: RayFusion通过射线占用信息有效提升了纯相机协作感知系统的检测性能，为自动驾驶领域的协作视觉感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Motivation: 解决脑部MRI扫描中精确像素级标注不可用、只有弱标签（如切片级）可用时的异常检测挑战，需要快速准确检测脑部异常。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用判别性双提示调优机制生成高质量伪弱掩码；第二阶段使用基于固定位置随机嵌入的区域感知空间注意力分割网络。

Result: 在BraTS20、BraTS21、BraTS23和MSD数据集上实现了最先进的异常检测性能，显著优于现有WSAD方法，参数量少于800万。

Conclusion: RASALoRE框架在脑部MRI弱监督异常检测中表现出色，实现了性能提升和计算复杂度降低的双重优势。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，使得润色过程不透明，难以适应多样化的用户或图像特定调整需求。

Method: 系统包含两个模块：视觉评论器识别输入图像与参考图像之间的差异，代码生成器产生可执行代码。采用渐进式增强方式，支持探索不同的调整路径。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够很好地泛化到不同的润色风格，基于自然语言的用户交互实现了可解释和可控的调整，符合用户意图。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一个无需训练数据、可解释且可控的图像润色解决方案，通过代码生成和渐进式增强实现了灵活的个性化调整。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多时相类驱动层次残差神经网络，用于在不同语义层次上对多光谱图像时间序列进行分类，通过层次惩罚映射和模块化架构提高分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多光谱图像时间序列分类时，难以有效利用类层次结构信息，特别是在训练样本有限的情况下。需要一种能够同时处理不同语义层次分类的模块化架构。

Method: 修改ResNet架构，引入额外分支进行不同层次分类，使用层次惩罚映射避免不连贯的层次转换。利用类层次标签高效训练不同层，前层学习宏观类别，后层学习微观类别。

Result: 在亚马逊森林两个区域的12个月Sentinel 2图像上实验，证明该方法能有效泛化不同层次，在微观类别上实现准确分类，并更好地表示少数类别。

Conclusion: 提出的层次模块化网络具有内在适应能力，通过微调可在新目标区域学习判别特征，在详细层次上提高分类准确性。

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

TL;DR: RedFace是一个面向真实世界的深度伪造人脸数据集，包含6万多张伪造图像和1000个操纵视频，使用9个商业在线平台生成，模拟真实黑盒场景，验证现有检测方案在真实应用中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测的学术评估和基准测试缺乏针对性、多样性有限、操纵技术受限，无法有效应对真实世界威胁。

Method: 使用9个商业在线平台整合最新的"野外"深度伪造技术，通过定制算法合成多样化的深度伪造内容，模拟真实黑盒场景。

Result: 在RedFace上的广泛实验（包括跨域、域内和真实社交网络传播模拟）验证了现有深度伪造检测方案在真实应用中的实用性有限。

Conclusion: RedFace数据集填补了学术评估与真实世界需求之间的差距，揭示了传统数据集对检测性能的影响原因。

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

Motivation: AI生成视频已达到近乎完美的视觉真实感，迫切需要可靠的检测机制，但现有方法面临高维时空动态建模和识别违反物理规律的细微异常的挑战。

Method: 提出归一化时空梯度统计量NSG，量化空间概率梯度与时间密度变化的比例；利用预训练扩散模型开发NSG估计器，通过空间梯度近似和运动感知时间建模；基于NSG特征计算测试视频与真实视频的MMD距离作为检测指标。

Conclusion: NSG-VD通过物理驱动的检测范式，有效识别AI生成视频的分布偏移，为视频真实性检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中由于隐私保护和知识产权问题，获取训练数据往往被禁止。现有后门攻击方法需要访问训练数据，因此开发无需训练数据的后门攻击方法具有重要研究意义。

Method: 设计了双语义引导的阴影后门攻击框架，仅使用替代数据集微调受害者模型的特定层。通过拓扑对齐损失优化个体和相邻中毒样本向目标样本对齐，增强攻击能力。

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了无需训练数据的深度哈希后门攻击，在保持原始检索精度的同时实现了强大的攻击能力，对深度哈希模型的安全性提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端视角下人脸解析因标注数据有限而面临的挑战，避免昂贵的手动标注成本。

Method: 通过联合拟合两个3D高斯泼溅模型（一个用于RGB图像，一个用于初始分割图），利用共享几何实现多视角一致性，合成姿态多样的训练数据。

Result: 在具有挑战性的头部姿态上显著提高了人脸解析精度，同时在标准视图上保持强性能，无需真实3D标注且仅使用少量初始图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升现实场景中人脸解析的鲁棒性提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法将自然图像的增强技术直接应用于CT图像时，忽略了CT图像中Hounsfield单位的物理意义，可能导致伪影和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 提出随机窗位调整增强技术，该方法专门针对CT图像的HU强度分布特性设计，通过调整窗位来增强模型对对比度变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的消融实验和分析表明，该方法在肝脏肿瘤分割任务中优于现有最先进方法，特别是在对比度差或时间不佳的图像上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: CT特定的增强技术比通用的自然图像增强方法更适合医学图像分析，随机窗位调整能有效提升模型在挑战性CT图像上的分割性能。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Motivation: 解决实时运动可控视频生成的挑战，包括双向扩散模型的固有延迟问题，以及现有自回归方法在少步生成中存在的质量下降和运动伪影问题。

Method: 首先微调基础图像到视频模型以支持基本运动控制，然后通过强化学习使用基于轨迹的奖励模型进一步改进。通过自展开机制保持马尔可夫性质，并在去噪步骤中选择性引入随机性来加速训练。

Result: 实验表明AR-Drag实现了高视觉保真度和精确的运动对齐，与最先进的运动可控视频扩散模型相比显著降低了延迟，仅使用13亿参数。

Conclusion: AR-Drag是第一个RL增强的少步自回归视频扩散模型，能够实现实时图像到视频生成，具有多样化运动控制能力，在延迟和性能方面都有显著改进。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了视频语言模型的时间逻辑一致性，并在通用视频时间定位任务中取得性能提升。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是视频时间理解的瓶颈，通过增强一致性可以推动视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Method: 在潜在视频扩散模型中探索条件注入策略、训练方案和数据混合技术，设计不同的数据构建和条件利用方法，使模型能够精确利用所有条件类型。

Conclusion: 该研究突破了现有技术的限制，为多模态视频生成提供了更强大的解决方案，实现了之前无法达到的4K视频生成能力。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态链式思维和深度置信推理，有效解决了复杂图像编辑中的推理挑战，为细粒度视觉编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类任务需要处理几何偏差和噪声，现有方法依赖大量数据增强或等变架构，但前者需要强大模型，后者限制了表达能力和增加了成本。

Method: 采用自举算法，通过迭代重对齐训练样本，逐步减少方差并恢复对齐假设，为任意紧致群建立收敛保证。

Conclusion: 自举规范化方法提供了一种有效的替代方案，能够在细粒度视觉分类中处理几何偏差，而无需依赖大量数据增强或受约束的等变架构。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本编辑方法难以精确定位对象位置，而对象拖拽方法仅限于静态重定位，无法实现语义层面的编辑控制。需要一种能同时处理精确定位和语义编辑的方法。

Method: 将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为两个协同分支：移动重建分支使用基于能量的梯度引导来精确移动对象，文本驱动编辑分支共享梯度信号以确保一致性变换。采用DDPM反演和噪声图先验注入来保持对象结构。

Result: 实验表明InstructUDrag能够实现灵活、高保真的图像编辑，在对象重定位精度和图像内容语义控制方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了文本指令和对象拖拽的优势，为图像编辑提供了更精确的位置控制和更丰富的语义编辑能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

Conclusion: FineDual方法能够生成细粒度高质量的双人运动，成功解决了动态层次化人类交互建模的问题。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像多标签分类标注成本高且困难，单正多标签学习虽可扩展但引入监督模糊，需要专门解决方案

Method: 采用梯度校准机制结合Mixup和双EMA模块生成鲁棒伪标签，引入自适应触发指标在预热后基于训练动态启动梯度校准

Result: 在两个基准遥感数据集和两种标签噪声类型下，AdaGC实现了最先进性能并保持强鲁棒性

Conclusion: AdaGC是专为遥感图像设计的通用单正多标签学习框架，能有效缓解标签噪声过拟合问题

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NTN-Diff方法，通过频率感知的扩散模型解决文本引导图像修复中的语义一致性和未掩码区域保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时解决未掩码区域保护和掩码/未掩码区域语义一致性这两个挑战，这源于不同频率带在去噪过程中对文本提示的鲁棒性差异。

Method: 将去噪过程分为早期（高级噪声）和晚期（低级噪声）阶段，通过空文本空频率感知扩散模型，在去噪过程中解耦中低频带，使用稳定的中频带引导低频带去噪。

Result: 大量实验验证NTN-Diff在文本引导扩散模型中的优越性。

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频率分解方法有效解决了文本引导图像修复中的关键挑战，实现了语义一致性和区域保护的双重目标。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ERU框架，通过结合LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，在复杂场景中实现更准确的目标对象识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放词汇目标检测方法在存在多个候选对象的模糊场景中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 联合利用LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，实现语言指令和指向线索的鲁棒集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，实现了更准确可靠的指称检测。

Conclusion: 所提出的ERU框架能够有效处理复杂或杂乱环境中的歧义问题，提升指称理解性能。

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

TL;DR: 提出Neural Exposure Fields (NExF)，一种通过3D空间中的曝光场预测来提升神经场景表示在动态范围场景下重建质量的新方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经场景表示在包含强曝光变化的真实场景中表现不佳，如室内外混合场景或带窗户的房间，需要解决3D一致的曝光优化问题

Method: 学习预测每个3D点的最优曝光值，通过神经条件机制联合优化场景表示和曝光场，将传统图像级曝光选择推广到3D空间

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，相比最佳基线提升超过55%，训练速度更快，能够准确合成高动态范围场景的视图

Conclusion: NExF通过3D曝光场学习有效解决了真实场景中的曝光变化问题，无需后处理或多曝光捕获，显著提升了神经场景重建的质量和鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），通过稀疏局部注意力堆叠和全局查询交互来平衡局部性和全局性，在四个参考视频分割基准上实现了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参考视频分割（RVOS）中长程时序上下文信息提取的挑战。现有方法要么在所有帧上使用注意力，要么堆叠密集局部注意力，但无法平衡局部性和全局性，且计算复杂度随视频长度显著增加。

Method: 提出LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力（扩张窗口注意力）平衡局部性和全局性；2）每个查询从全局池中随机选择少量键进行注意力增强全局性；3）设计全局查询与所有其他查询交互直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个参考视频分割基准上实现了新的最先进性能，在MeViS valu和val数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制有效平衡了局部性和全局性，显著提升了参考视频分割性能，同时控制了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D功能分割方法依赖点云编码器作为通用特征提取器，但忽视了3D数据固有的稀疏性、噪声和几何模糊性挑战，导致学习到的3D特征缺乏清晰且语义一致的功能边界。

Method: 1. 跨模态亲和力转移(CMAT)：预训练策略，将3D编码器与提升的2D语义对齐，联合优化重建、亲和力和多样性；2. 跨模态功能分割变换器(CAST)：集成多模态提示与CMAT预训练特征，生成精确的提示感知分割图。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架在3D功能分割任务上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 提出的语义基础学习范式成功地将大规模2D视觉基础模型的语义知识迁移到3D领域，有效解决了3D功能分割中的语义一致性挑战。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

TL;DR: LinVideo是一个高效的无数据后训练框架，通过将自注意力模块替换为线性注意力来降低视频扩散模型的计算成本，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，而线性注意力虽然能降低计算成本，但完全替换二次注意力需要昂贵的预训练，且线性注意力的表达能力有限。

Method: 提出选择性转移方法，将层选择建模为二分类问题，自动渐进地将层转换为线性注意力；引入任意时间分布匹配目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了1.25-2.00倍加速，同时保持生成质量；4步蒸馏模型进一步实现了15.92倍延迟减少，视觉质量下降最小。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效降低了视频扩散模型的计算成本，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Method: 创建DTPQA基准，排除需要推理的问题，仅评估纯感知能力。评估多个最先进的小型视觉语言模型在交通场景中的表现。

Result: 最佳小型VLM平均准确率约60%，远低于人类约85%的表现。模型在左右区分等特定感知任务上表现尤其困难。

Conclusion: 当前小型视觉语言模型在交通场景感知方面仍有显著差距，需要进一步改进才能满足自动驾驶系统的需求。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater

or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型主要局限于图像领域，需要扩展到视频领域以实现统一的视频生成和编辑能力。

Method: 采用双流设计：多模态大语言模型(MLLM)用于指令理解，多模态DiT(MMDiT)用于视频生成，通过联合训练统一多种视频任务。

Conclusion: UniVideo展示了统一视频建模的可行性，支持任务组合和跨任务泛化，为未来视频生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Motivation: 解决医学图像数据隐私和安全问题，现有源自由域自适应方法主要关注伪标签优化，缺乏对学习过程的考虑。从源域到目标域的渐进学习过程有利于知识迁移。

Method: 提出LFC框架，包含两个课程：1) 从易到难课程，从简单样本开始学习，逐步增加样本难度调整模型优化方向；2) 从源到目标课程，确保模型从源域到目标域的平滑迁移。

Conclusion: LFC框架通过课程学习策略有效解决了源自由域自适应问题，在医学图像分割任务中取得了优异性能，同时保护了数据隐私。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

Motivation: 尽管连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在学术规模扩散加速中表现优异，但其在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性仍不明确，主要面临雅可比向量积计算的基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 开发了并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP核，支持超过100亿参数模型训练；提出分数正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，通过分数蒸馏作为长跳跃正则器，结合sCM的前向散度和反向散度的模式寻求特性。

Result: 在Cosmos-Predict2、Wan2.1等高达140亿参数模型和5秒视频任务上，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，无需GAN调优或大量超参数搜索。

Conclusion: rCM作为一个实用且理论基础的框架，为推进大规模扩散蒸馏提供了有效解决方案，能够在仅1-4步内生成高保真样本，实现15-50倍的扩散采样加速。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

*Andrew Lee,Ian Chuang,Dechen Gao,Kai Fukazawa,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gaze on the Prize框架，通过可学习的注视注意力机制和基于回报差异的自监督信号，提高视觉强化学习的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习代理需要从高维图像数据中学习，但只有少量像素与任务相关，导致探索和计算资源浪费，学习效率低下且不稳定。

Method: 引入可学习的注视注意力机制，通过回报引导的对比学习训练注意力，基于回报差异将相似视觉表示分组为正负样本，构建对比三元组来训练注意力机制。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准测试的多个操作任务中，样本效率提高了2.4倍，能够解决基线方法无法学习的任务，且无需修改底层算法或超参数。

Conclusion: 基于人类视觉注视机制和回报差异的注意力学习方法能有效提高视觉强化学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个综合性的图像处理框架，能够同时处理多种图像分析任务，包括简化表示、增强细节、提取几何特征等，以满足实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的需求。

Method: 采用模块化设计：灰度量化将图像分为8个离散级别；在RGB和YCrCb色彩空间进行直方图均衡化；通过HSV值通道调整亮度；使用3×3卷积核进行图像锐化；构建包含反锐化掩模、伽马校正和噪声放大的双向变换管道；应用Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测和形态学窗口定位进行几何特征提取。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架在图像处理和分析方面表现出色，具有实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的潜力，各模块协同工作实现了全面的图像处理能力。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖文本先验，在开放词汇场景中难以区分语义相似的动作，存在跨模态幻觉问题。

Method: 将动作分解为可区分的子动作进行细粒度匹配，同时动态调用领域特定工具进行跨模态交错，通过分层奖励机制平衡工具使用效率、子动作相关性和推理结构连贯性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了视觉象似性挑战基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在从手语视频中恢复形式-意义映射的能力，包括音系形式预测、透明度和象似性评级三个任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中普遍存在的象似性（形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了天然测试平台，需要评估视觉语言模型从动态人体动作而非静态上下文中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，将心理语言学测量方法应用于视频评估，包含三个任务：音系手语形式预测（手形、位置）、透明度（从视觉形式推断意义）和分级象似性评级。在荷兰手语上评估13个最先进的视觉语言模型。

Result: 在音系形式预测方面，模型能恢复部分手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度方面远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评级有中等相关性。有趣的是，音系形式预测能力更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，表明需要采用以人为本的信号和具身学习方法建模象似性，以改进多模态模型中的视觉基础能力。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的视频经常受到噪声、压缩伪影和低光失真等多种复杂退化的影响，现有方法需要人工选择专用模型或采用单一架构，难以泛化处理不同退化类型。

Method: 提出MoA-VR系统，包含三个智能体：基于视觉语言模型的退化识别器、基于大语言模型的自适应路由器、以及专门为修复任务设计的视频质量评估模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoA-VR能够有效处理多样化和复合退化问题，在客观指标和感知质量方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了多模态智能和模块化推理在通用视频修复系统中的潜力，为处理复杂视频退化问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇点，但很少研究视觉编码器中的ViT注意力汇点。这些高范数视觉标记可能包含重要语义信息，对LVLM的理解和推理能力有重要影响。

Method: 提出定性和定量分析ViT汇点标记中的信息，并开发了免训练和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些信息。通过显式使用这些标记来改进LLM对视觉信息的解释。

Result: 通过显式利用ViT注意力汇点标记，在多种LVLM和视觉推理任务上实现了显著性能提升，证明了这些标记在增强视觉推理方面的巨大潜力。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇点是LVLM中未被充分利用的重要资源，包含丰富的语义信息。有效利用这些标记可以显著提升模型的视觉理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅实现了高效压缩，还支持下游应用如多机器人位姿图优化和地图合并，性能与原始LiDAR扫描相当。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Result: SliceFine在语言和视觉任务上达到了最先进PEFT方法的性能，同时显著提高了训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了理论与实践，为现有PEFT技术提供了理论依据的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Motivation: 现有视频生成方法在轨迹控制方面存在局限性，需要开发能够支持密集和稀疏轨迹控制的统一框架，同时提高训练效率和推理速度。

Method: 采用统一的点基运动表示（分割ID、轨迹ID、颜色通道），使用序列拼接方案替代传统条件注入方法，并采用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督的依赖。

Result: 实验表明FlexTraj实现了多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制，支持运动克隆、拖拽式图像到视频、运动插值、相机重定向等多种应用。

Conclusion: FlexTraj为图像到视频生成提供了灵活高效的轨迹控制能力，在收敛速度、可控性和推理效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在根本性挑战，主要原因是缺乏从感知到理解的层次化基础，直接学习空间推理效果不佳。

Method: 构建SpatialLadder-26k多模态数据集，包含26,610个样本；设计三阶段渐进训练框架：空间感知（目标定位）、空间理解（多维空间任务）、复杂推理（带可验证奖励的强化学习）。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MM-HELIX基准测试来评估多模态大语言模型的长链反思推理能力，并开发了AHPO训练策略来提升模型性能，在基准测试上实现了18.6%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学和逻辑推理任务上表现出色，但其长链反思推理能力（解决复杂现实问题所需的关键能力）尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过数据合成引擎构建MM-HELIX基准测试，开发Step-Elicited Response Generation流程创建MM-HELIX-100K数据集，并提出自适应混合策略优化(AHPO)训练方法，将离线监督和在线优化动态统一。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B基线上，该方法在MM-HELIX基准测试上实现了+18.6%的准确率提升，在通用数学和逻辑任务上平均性能提升+5.7%。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型的反思推理能力可以有效学习和泛化，为开发更强大的MLLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

TL;DR: ARTDECO是一个统一的3D重建框架，结合了前馈模型的效率和SLAM管道的可靠性，通过3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，使用高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，实现了交互式性能和高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目图像序列实时3D重建的挑战，现有方法在保真度和计算效率之间存在权衡：逐场景优化保真度高但计算昂贵，前馈基础模型实时但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，设计分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略以提高渲染保真度并减少冗余。

Result: 在8个不同的室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO实现了与SLAM相当的交互性能，与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了一条实用路径，兼具准确几何和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir提出了一种基于想象力的记忆检索机制，通过世界模型想象未来导航状态作为查询，选择性检索环境观察和行为历史，在记忆持久性视觉语言导航任务中取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆持久性VLN方法存在关键限制：缺乏有效记忆访问机制，依赖完整记忆整合或固定时间窗口查找，主要存储环境观察而忽略编码有价值决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件世界模型想象未来状态，用于编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视角级记忆，将观察和行为模式锚定到视角，实现混合检索；3) 经验增强导航模型，通过专用编码器集成检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的多样化记忆持久性VLN基准测试中，Memoir在所有场景均显著改进：在IR2R上比最佳记忆持久性基线提升5.4% SPL，同时实现8.3倍训练加速和74%推理内存减少。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆可实现更有效导航，分析表明这种想象力引导范式仍有巨大提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

TL;DR: VideoCanvas提出了任意时空视频补全任务，通过用户指定的空间位置和时间戳生成视频，统一了多种可控视频生成任务。该框架采用零参数增加的上下文条件化方法，通过时空解耦策略解决了因果VAE的时间模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代潜在视频扩散模型存在时间模糊性问题，多个像素帧被压缩到单个潜在表示中，使得精确的帧级条件化变得困难。需要一种能够统一多种可控视频生成任务的灵活框架。

Method: VideoCanvas采用混合条件化策略：空间控制通过零填充处理，时间对齐通过时间RoPE插值实现，为每个条件分配连续的分数位置。该方法无需新参数，在冻结骨干网络上实现像素帧感知控制。

Result: 实验表明VideoCanvas显著优于现有条件化范式，在灵活统一的视频生成方面建立了新的最先进水平。开发了首个任意时空视频补全基准VideoCanvasBench。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas成功解决了因果VAE的时间模糊性问题，实现了像素帧感知的精确控制，为统一的可控视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频插帧方法无法生成复杂运动，缺乏用户意图的多样性和对中间帧细节的精细控制，与创作需求存在差距。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer架构，将运动控制映射为基于点的通用表示，分离内容和运动控制为两个分支，采用分阶段训练策略。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，多模态控制能够实现更动态、可定制和上下文准确的视觉叙事。

Conclusion: 该框架在灵活性、易用性和精度之间取得了平衡，为视频编辑和长视频合成提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

TL;DR: 提出ResAD框架，通过归一化残差轨迹建模解决端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，将学习任务重新定义为预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据固有的时空不平衡问题，这导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，同时优先考虑不确定的远距离预测，从而危及即时安全。

Method: ResAD框架将预测任务重新定义为预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差，并引入点级归一化来重新加权优化目标，防止远距离不确定路径点的大幅度误差主导学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD使用仅有两个去噪步骤的普通扩散策略实现了88.6的最先进PDMS分数，表明该方法显著简化了学习任务并提高了模型性能。

Conclusion: ResAD通过残差轨迹建模和点级归一化有效解决了端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，简化了学习任务并提升了性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Method: 在数据约束的实际设置下，系统研究原生MLLM的各种设计选择，找到最佳元架构，并探索视觉编码器与LLM之间的缩放关系，提出NaViL模型和简单有效的训练方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，NaViL在14个多模态基准测试中展现出与现有MLLMs相竞争的性能，并揭示了视觉编码器与LLM之间正相关的缩放关系。

Conclusion: 原生MLLM训练是可行的，本文的研究结果为未来原生MLLM研究提供了深入见解，NaViL模型展示了良好的性能与训练成本平衡。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating

Motivation: 传统前馈高斯溅射模型依赖单次前向传播，性能受限。需要一种能够迭代优化且适应未见数据分布的方法。

Result: 在多种输入视图、分辨率和数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到最先进性能，同时显著减少高斯数量并提升渲染速度。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环反馈机制实现了高效的高斯优化，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了计算效率。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效构建紧凑的目标数字孪生，在保持预测精度的同时显著降低计算成本，为数字孪生应用提供了高效的计算解决方案。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探讨自闭症谱系障碍儿童行为模式和情绪识别的重要性，提出通过纵向监测建立基线理解，并开发针对性技术辅助框架来改善学习和发展轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自闭症谱系障碍显著影响个体的沟通、学习、行为和社交能力。虽然早期干预和定制教育策略对改善结果至关重要，但在技能发展前理解和解决自闭症儿童的细微行为模式和情绪识别方面存在关键差距。

Method: 采用纵向方法监测情绪和行为，分析随时间变化的行为趋势，建立对自闭症学生独特需求和挑战的基线理解，特别是在信息技术领域。

Result: 提出了一个针对性框架，用于开发满足已识别需求的应用和技术辅助工具，强调基于证据的干预方法。

Conclusion: 通过将重点转向早期行为模式识别，旨在培养更具包容性和支持性的学习环境，显著改善自闭症儿童的教育和发展轨迹。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

*Qinglun Li,Yingqi Liu,Miao Zhang,Xiaochun Cao,Quanjun Yin,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 多Gossip步骤(MGS)作为去中心化训练和中心化训练之间的桥梁，通过稳定性分析推导了泛化误差和超额误差的上界，发现MGS能指数级减少优化误差，但即使MGS趋于无穷，与中心化训练之间仍存在不可忽略的泛化误差差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化训练虽然通信效率高，但性能通常低于中心化训练。MGS作为简单有效的方法能显著缩小这一差距，但其理论有效性和差距能否完全消除仍是未解问题。

Method: 使用稳定性分析推导MGS的泛化误差和超额误差上界，分析学习率、数据异质性、节点数量、节点样本量和通信拓扑等因素对MGS泛化的影响，并在非凸设置下进行统一分析。

Result: 1) MGS以指数速率减少优化误差界，从而指数级收紧泛化误差界；2) 即使MGS趋于无穷，与中心化mini-batch SGD相比仍存在不可忽略的泛化误差差距；3) 在CIFAR数据集上的实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: MGS能有效缩小去中心化与中心化训练的性能差距，但无法完全消除这一差距，为去中心化训练提供了重要的理论指导。

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

*Sixuan Wang,Jiao Yin,Jinli Cao,Mingjian Tang,Yong-Feng Ge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MACC-MGNAS方法，通过模态感知协同进化算法优化多模态图神经网络架构搜索，解决软件漏洞协同利用攻击预测问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态漏洞数据分析可缓解软件漏洞协同利用攻击风险，但设计有效的多模态图神经网络架构具有挑战性，现有方法局限于单模态且忽略模态异质性

Method: 开发模态感知协同进化框架，包括协调器分割染色体、本地工作者独立进化、协调器重组评估；引入模态感知双轨代理方法降低评估成本；设计基于相似度的种群多样性指标策略平衡探索与利用

Result: 在标准漏洞协同利用数据集上，MACC-MGNAS在仅3GPU小时内达到81.67%的F1分数，比现有最优方法提升8.7% F1，同时降低27%计算成本

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS有效解决了多模态图神经网络架构搜索中的模态异质性挑战，显著提升了漏洞协同利用攻击预测性能

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MultiFair方法解决多模态医疗分类中的模态偏差和群体不公平问题，通过双层级梯度调制实现公平的多模态学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习模型存在两个关键挑战：不同数据模态学习不均衡导致模型偏向某些模态，以及模型可能对某些人口群体表现不公平。这两个方面相互影响，导致不平衡且不公平的多模态学习

Method: 提出MultiFair方法，采用双层级梯度调制过程，在数据模态和群体层级上动态调节训练梯度的优化方向和幅度

Result: 在两个多模态医疗数据集上的实验表明，MultiFair优于最先进的多模态学习和公平性学习方法

Conclusion: MultiFair能够有效解决多模态医疗分类中的模态偏差和群体不公平问题，为医疗决策系统提供更可靠和公平的诊断

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

### [109] [Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Climate-Aware Yield Prediction with Earth Observation Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07350)
*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了两种深度学习模型(GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT)在作物产量预测中的跨区域泛化能力，发现GNN-RNN在异地条件下表现更优，且训练速度快135倍，强调时空对齐对稳健泛化的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化日益破坏农业系统，需要准确的作物产量预测来保障粮食安全。虽然深度学习模型在利用卫星和天气数据进行产量预测方面显示出潜力，但它们在跨地理区域和年份的泛化能力（对实际部署至关重要）尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 使用覆盖2017-2022年美国1200多个县的CropNet数据集，通过跨七个USDA农场资源区域的留一聚类交叉验证和年度预测场景，在现实的分布外(OOD)条件下对GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT两种最先进模型进行基准测试。

Result: GNN-RNN在地理转移下表现出优越的泛化能力，具有正相关性，而MMST-ViT在域内表现良好但在OOD条件下急剧退化。Heartland和Northern Great Plains等区域显示出稳定的转移动态，而Prairie Gateway在所有模型和作物中持续表现不佳。GNN-RNN的训练速度比MMST-ViT快135倍。

Conclusion: 时空对齐（而不仅仅是模型复杂性或数据规模）是实现稳健泛化的关键，需要透明的OOD评估协议来确保公平可靠的气候感知农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种生成高质量CUDA内核数据集的管道ConCuR，并开发了首个在PyTorch-推理-CUDA内核三元组数据集上训练的模型KernelCoder，在KernelBench上显著超越现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPU内核生成中高质量数据稀缺的问题，因为大多数高质量内核是专有且不开源的，这阻碍了使用监督微调来对齐LLM到内核生成任务。

Method: 开发了一个生成和筛选高质量CUDA内核及推理轨迹的管道，基于关键观察：简洁但信息丰富的推理轨迹能稳健地生成高性能内核。构建了ConCuR数据集并训练了KernelCoder模型。

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，模型显著超越了现有最佳模型QwQ-32B，优于所有为内核生成微调的开源模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，所提出的观察、指标和数据收集管道有助于未来在内核生成任务中获得更好的数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETD方法通过在推理时迭代特定层来增强语言模型的推理能力，无需改变模型架构或增加参数，在多个推理基准上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过扩大模型规模或增加推理计算来提升推理能力，但研究表明关键推理计算集中在少数层中，因此希望通过迭代这些层来增强推理。

Method: ETD方法在训练阶段让模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，推理时在这些选定层上重复计算以增强潜在推理能力。

Result: 在17个推理基准上取得显著提升，OLMo-2 1B模型在GSM8K上相对准确率提升28.4%，在MATH上提升36%。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为增强LLM推理能力提供了一条简单有效的路径。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言对话数据中的主题模式，并研究这些主题与用户对LLM输出偏好的关系，特别是某些LLM是否在特定主题中持续被偏好。

Method: 设计多语言预处理流程，使用BERTopic提取主题，通过可视化技术（主题距离图、概率分布、模型-主题矩阵）分析主题与模型偏好的关系。

Result: 提取了29个连贯主题（如人工智能、编程、伦理、云基础设施等），分析了主题与模型偏好的关联趋势。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进LLM在实际应用中的性能和用户满意度提供了领域特定微调和优化策略的指导。

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究线性上下文赌博机中的付费观测问题，学习者可以选择支付固定成本来观测任何臂的损失，旨在设计一个在对抗性和随机环境中都能表现良好的算法。

Method: 基于Follow-the-Regularized-Leader框架，通过矩阵几何重采样构建高效估计器，开发了计算高效的Best-of-Both-Worlds算法。

Result: 算法在对抗性设置中实现了Θ(T^{2/3})的最小最大最优遗憾，在（被破坏的）随机机制中保证了多项式对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 该研究为"困难问题"设计了BOBW算法，并通过针对特定设置的分析技术验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

TL;DR: BaRP是一种基于偏好调节的在线路由方法，通过上下文多臂老虎机框架在训练时模拟部署环境的部分反馈限制，实现无需重新训练即可调节性能/成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由系统大多依赖离线训练，需要所有候选模型的标签，这在部署中不现实。实际部署时只能观察到所选模型的结果，存在训练与部署环境不匹配的问题。

Method: 将LLM路由建模为基于提示特征和用户偏好向量的上下文多臂老虎机问题，在训练时模拟在线反馈环境，使路由决策能够适应每个新提示。

Result: 实验表明该方法比强离线路由方法至少提升12.46%，比最大LLM至少提升2.45%，并且在未见任务上具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: BaRP成功弥合了训练与部署环境之间的差距，支持偏好可调推理，为大规模LLM部署提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习可以加速强化学习，但现有TD学习方法在马尔可夫数据下需要依赖未知问题参数才能达到最优收敛速率，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了双时间尺度的联邦时序差分学习算法，结合Polyak-Ruppert平均技术，无需依赖未知参数。

Result: 该方法在平均奖励和折扣设置下均证明了可以达到最优的O~(1/NT)收敛速率，适用于异构环境的联邦学习场景。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了联邦TD学习在马尔可夫数据下的理论空白，提供了一种参数无关的解决方案，即使在单智能体场景下也具有创新性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

Motivation: 科学文献中药代动力学信息的提取和标准化存在挑战，限制了药物开发中数据驱动模型的可靠性。LLMs在生物医学结构化数据（如PK表格）上的应用受到异质性、噪声和领域偏移的限制。

Method: HySim-LLM统一数学计算框架，整合嵌入加权微调和流形感知去噪。建立了两个理论结果：相似性加权泛化边界和基于流形的去噪保证。

Result: 为结构化生物医学环境中微调LLMs提供了理论基础，量化了嵌入差异下的适应性能，并限制了噪声或离流样本的损失贡献。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物医学和数据密集型科学领域提供了可靠且可解释的LLM适应的数学基础路径。

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

TL;DR: 提出了MoGU，一种基于不确定性的高斯混合专家框架，用于时间序列预测回归任务，通过建模专家输出为高斯分布来量化预测不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE方法只提供点估计，无法量化预测不确定性，而时间序列预测中不确定性评估对决策至关重要。

Method: 将每个专家输出建模为高斯分布，用专家估计的方差替代传统基于输入的选通机制，基于不确定性确定专家对最终预测的贡献。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，MoGU持续优于单专家模型和传统MoE设置，并提供与预测误差直接相关的良好量化不确定性。

Conclusion: MoGU框架在提高预测准确性的同时，显著增强了预测可靠性，为时间序列预测提供了有效的概率建模方法。

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用张量补全作为替代模型，在材料设计搜索空间存在偏差采样时，相比传统机器学习方法能更好地加速晶格结构优化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料设计中需要寻找具有特定性能的材料，但随着设计变量增加，搜索空间呈指数增长，传统合成和验证方法变得不切实际。特别是在训练数据来自非均匀随机采样时（如实验人员偏向合成某些方便的材料），传统机器学习方法表现不佳。

Method: 使用张量补全作为替代模型来加速材料设计，特别是在存在偏差采样的监督学习场景中。

Result: 实验表明，在搜索空间存在偏差采样时，张量补全优于高斯过程和XGBoost等经典机器学习方法，R²提高了约5%。在均匀随机采样时，张量补全仍能提供可比较的性能。

Conclusion: 张量补全是在材料设计搜索空间存在偏差采样时的有效替代模型，能够显著提升机械性能优化晶格结构的设计效率。

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

TL;DR: HEMERA是一个基于Transformer的可解释深度学习框架，直接处理GWAS基因型数据预测肺癌风险，无需临床协变量，AUC超过99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是美国第三大常见癌症和主要癌症死因，虽然吸烟是主要风险因素，但不吸烟者和家族聚集研究显示遗传因素的重要性。GWAS发现的遗传生物标志物有望用于评估肺癌风险。

Method: HEMERA框架应用可解释的Transformer深度学习处理GWAS单核苷酸多态性数据，引入加性位置编码、神经基因型嵌入和改进的变异过滤，使用基于层间集成梯度的后验可解释性模块将预测归因于特定SNP。

Result: 在27,254名百万退伍军人计划参与者数据上训练，HEMERA获得了超过99%的AUC得分，模型预测与已知肺癌风险位点高度一致。

Conclusion: 研究支持使用透明、可生成假设的模型进行个性化肺癌风险评估和早期干预。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际场景下机器生成文本检测的挑战：评分模型可能与未知源模型不匹配，且每个输入的对比生成成本高昂。

Method: 将surprisal量化为可解释状态，估计测试文本的状态转换矩阵，通过广义Jensen-Shannon差距与预先构建的人类和机器参考进行比较。

Result: 在多个数据集、源模型和场景下，SurpMark始终匹配或超越基线方法，实验证实了统计量的渐近正态性，消融实验验证了离散化的有效性。

Conclusion: SurpMark提供了一种有效且实用的机器生成文本检测方法，能够在模型不匹配和成本约束下实现可靠检测。

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Motivation: 现有研究通常只关注孤立的攻击面或特定场景，缺乏对多智能体系统脆弱性的整体理解，需要系统性的评估基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 引入PEAR基准测试，专注于广泛采用的规划器-执行器架构，通过大量实验系统评估多智能体系统的效用和脆弱性。

Result: 发现：(1)弱规划器比弱执行器更严重影响系统性能；(2)规划器需要记忆模块，但执行器的记忆模块不影响性能；(3)任务性能与鲁棒性存在权衡；(4)针对规划器的攻击特别有效。

Conclusion: 这些发现为增强多智能体系统鲁棒性提供了可行见解，为多智能体环境中的原则性防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

Motivation: 时间序列数据分析面临复杂时间依赖性和跨通道交互的挑战，受人类视觉检查时间序列模式的启发，探索视觉表示是否能增强自动化时间序列分析。

Method: 将每个时间序列通道渲染为水平堆叠的彩色线图，采用时间感知视觉补丁对齐策略，将视觉补丁与对应时间段对齐，融合数值数据的细粒度时间细节和视觉表示的全局上下文信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MLLM4TS在预测任务（如分类）和生成任务（如异常检测和预测）中均表现有效。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了将视觉模态与预训练语言模型整合以实现稳健和可泛化时间序列分析的潜力。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

Motivation: 准确的睡眠分期对睡眠障碍的诊断和管理至关重要。传统方法依赖人工标注或从EEG信号中提取时域/频域特征，需要更自动化和准确的方法。

Method: 使用连续小波变换(CWT)生成时频图，捕捉与睡眠分期相关的瞬态和振荡模式，结合集成学习方法进行睡眠分期。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF扩展数据库上评估，总体准确率达到88.37%，宏平均F1分数为73.15，优于传统机器学习方法，与深度学习性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 小波分析在睡眠分期中具有潜力，能够提供鲁棒、可解释且临床适用的分类方法。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

Motivation: 现实世界图中的边往往表现出对某些群体对的连接偏好，这种有偏见的连接会加剧甚至导致下游基于图的任务的不公平处理。

Method: 提出FairSpecTemp方法，包含两种变体：一种利用图平稳性的交换性质直接约束偏见，另一种通过限制图谱中的偏见来隐式鼓励公平估计。

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp能够有效估计公平图，两种变体各有优势，为图数据公平性提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

Motivation: 作为理解dropout在大型神经网络中作用的第一步，研究其在两层神经网络中的大宽度渐近行为，特别是通过均值场初始化尺度来分析梯度下降与dropout的结合。

Method: 使用均值场初始化尺度的两层神经网络，分析梯度下降与dropout结合的大宽度渐近行为，通过混合均值场粒子系统和随机过程的工具进行收敛证明。

Conclusion: 结果为在大规模神经网络中重新理论理解dropout奠定了基础，揭示了dropout在不同学习率下的不同行为机制。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

### [133] [Expanding the Action Space of LLMs to Reason Beyond Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07581)
*Zhongqi Yue,Weishi Wang,Yundaichuan Zhan,Juncheng Li,Daniel Dahlmeier,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Expanded Action空间(ExpA)方法，将环境交互从语言中解耦，让LLM能够在语言环境和外部环境间切换，并引入ExpA强化学习(EARL)来优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM只能输出词汇标记，与环境交互需要通过文本解析，这使语言同时承担推理和控制职责，且需要外部解析器。

Method: 通过ExpA将环境交互内部化，模型可在语言环境和外部环境间路由切换；引入EARL强化学习进行反事实策略优化。

Result: 在多轮交互和条件规划任务中，EARL优于词汇约束的基线方法；在计算器多任务学习和部分观察排序问题中表现优异，实现了完美的Sort-4准确率。

Conclusion: ExpA方法有效解耦了语言推理和环境交互，EARL能够自主发现高效算法，在复杂任务中展现出强大性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

TL;DR: TGM是一个研究导向的时序图机器学习库，首次统一了连续时间和离散时间动态图方法，提供了动态节点特征支持、时间粒度转换和原生多任务处理，相比现有库实现了显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态图机器学习已有成熟框架，但时序图ML缺乏可比的基础设施。现有时序图库通常针对特定架构，难以支持快速发展的多样化模型，且连续时间和离散时间方法之间存在鸿沟，限制了直接比较和思想交流。

Method: 开发TGM时序图建模库，统一连续时间和离散时间动态图方法，提供动态节点特征的一流支持、时间粒度转换功能，以及链接、节点和图级别任务的原生处理。

Result: TGM在多个模型、数据集和任务上相比广泛使用的DyGLib实现了平均7.8倍加速，在图离散化方面相比现有实现实现了平均175倍加速。

Conclusion: TGM不仅提供了效率优势，还通过支持动态图属性预测和时间驱动训练范式，开启了全新的研究可能性，为之前难以研究的问题打开了大门。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于注意力机制的Transformer模型用于铁路间接结构健康监测，通过无监督学习检测轨道断裂，在保持与先进方法相当准确率的同时提升推理速度，但发现高频局部噪声是所有模型的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于车载传感器的间接结构健康监测方法在检测小型瞬态异常（2-10厘米）时面临挑战，主要由于复杂车辆动力学、信号噪声和标记数据稀缺限制了监督学习方法的应用。

Method: 引入增量合成数据基准测试，评估模型对速度变化、多通道输入和真实噪声模式的鲁棒性。提出注意力聚焦Transformer模型，通过自注意力机制进行重构训练，主要从学习到的注意力权重偏差中推导异常分数。

Result: Transformer模型整体表现优于其他模型，但所有测试模型都对高频局部噪声表现出显著脆弱性。提出的模型在准确率上与最先进方法相当，同时具有更好的推理速度。

Conclusion: 未来iSHM模型需要增强噪声鲁棒性，基于注意力的高效方法为开发实用车载异常检测系统提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

TL;DR: DGTEN是一个用于动态信任评估的图神经网络框架，通过高斯分布表示节点和边的不确定性，结合时间建模和防御机制，在比特币信任网络中显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型快速演化的图需要能够捕捉变化关系、表达校准置信度并抵抗对抗性操纵的信任评估模型。

Method: 使用高斯分布表示节点和边，结合不确定性感知的消息传递、HAGH位置编码、KAN-based注意力机制、ODE残差学习模块，以及基于余弦和Jaccard相似度的鲁棒自适应集成系数分析。

Result: 在比特币信任网络中，单时间槽预测MCC提升10.77%，冷启动场景MCC增益16.41%，对抗攻击下MCC提升达11.63%。

Conclusion: DGTEN统一框架在动态信任评估中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

Motivation: 当前LLM遗忘研究缺乏统一标准和严谨评估方法，难以准确衡量遗忘效果与模型效用的平衡，需要建立更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出了三种方法家族分类：差异驱动优化、表示错位和基于拒绝的目标遗忘；引入开放问答指标替代传统选择题准确率评估；在WMDP基准上进行系统分析。

Result: 发现当前评估方法高估遗忘成功率，忽略模型实际生成行为；不同方法家族在遗忘效果与效用保持间存在明显权衡；模型鲁棒性需要更细粒度分析。

Conclusion: 为LLM遗忘研究提供了系统性回顾和实用指导，强调需要更全面的评估框架来准确衡量遗忘效果、效用保持和鲁棒性之间的平衡。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Motivation: 现有MABNI研究主要关注遗憾最小化，但过度强调最优臂会损害次优臂的推断准确性，这一权衡在网络干扰背景下更加显著。

Conclusion: 该工作为网络干扰下的多臂老虎机问题提供了兼顾遗憾最小化和推断准确性的理论框架和实用算法。

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习是神经网络在不丢失先前获得知识的情况下学习多个顺序任务的能力，这是开发真正自适应人工智能的重要障碍。深度学习中过拟合是常见问题，正则化技术可以通过对模型参数添加约束来防止过拟合。

Method: 在损失函数中引入基于簇间分离的正则化项，惩罚模型产生远离先前任务数据簇中心的输出。通过超参数调优找到正则化项的最佳权重，确保神经网络内部表示中任务间更清晰的分离。

Result: 使用标准的5任务Split CIFAR-10基准和ResNet-18架构，证明了ICS在保持初始任务强性能方面的有效性。但结果也突出了长期知识保留的局限性，特别是在任务数量增加时。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了持续学习中的复杂性和权衡，并为进一步研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

Conclusion: Value Flows通过流模型有效估计完整回报分布和状态不确定性，在离线和在线到在线设置中均表现出色，为强化学习提供了更精细的分布建模方法。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

Conclusion: FedQS填补了半异步联邦学习中聚合策略之间的差距，为稳定、准确和高效的联邦学习提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Conclusion: GRFs++通过创新的行走拼接和灵活的终止策略，有效解决了传统GRFs的局限性，在保持无偏性的同时显著提升了计算效率和近似精度。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

*Rongchao Xu,Kunlin Cai,Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Zhiqing Hong,Yuan Tian,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoGen是一个两阶段粗到细的框架，用于生成基于位置的社交网络签到轨迹数据，通过空间连续、时间规则的潜在运动序列重建和Transformer架构，解决了稀疏活动和不确定人类移动性带来的复杂时空模式挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高收集成本和日益增长的隐私问题，获取大规模LBSN轨迹数据变得困难。生成式AI为生成保留真实数据特征同时确保隐私保护的合成数据提供了新机会。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用稀疏感知时空扩散模型(S²TDiff)重建潜在运动序列；第二阶段使用Coarse2FineNet（基于Transformer的Seq2Seq架构）生成细粒度轨迹。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，GeoGen在保真度和实用性评估上都优于最先进模型，在FS-TKY数据集上距离和半径指标分别提高了69%和55%。

Conclusion: GeoGen框架能够有效生成高质量的LBSN签到轨迹数据，在保持数据特征的同时解决隐私问题，为POI推荐、广告和疫情干预等应用提供支持。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了MeSH方案解决递归transformer的性能瓶颈，通过外部内存缓冲区和轻量级路由器实现迭代间计算多样化，在1.4B规模上超越非递归模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归transformer在计算匹配时性能落后于非递归模型，主要存在计算未分化和信息过载两个瓶颈

Method: 引入Memory-as-State-Highways方案，将状态管理外部化到显式内存缓冲区，使用轻量级路由器动态多样化迭代间计算

Result: 在Pythia套件上，MeSH增强的递归transformer持续改进递归基线，1.4B规模上超越非递归对应模型，下游准确率平均提升1.06%，非嵌入参数减少33%

Conclusion: MeSH是构建更强递归模型的可扩展且原则性的架构

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

Motivation: 针对广泛使用的t-SNE方法，研究其输出结果是否真实反映输入数据结构的问题

Method: 通过理论证明和实践案例演示，分析t-SNE在聚类强度和异常点检测方面的局限性

Result: 证明t-SNE无法可靠推断输入数据的聚类强度和异常点极端程度，这些失败模式在实践中普遍存在

Conclusion: t-SNE可视化结果不能准确反映输入数据的真实结构特征，存在系统性偏差

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) is the conviction that it produces visualizations whose structure
roughly matches that of the input. To the contrary, we prove that (1) the
strength of the input clustering, and (2) the extremity of outlier points,
cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

TL;DR: FedBook是一个联邦图基础模型代码本，通过两阶段过程在服务器端联邦预训练中聚合客户端本地代码本，解决现有图基础模型需要集中访问多领域图的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基础模型通常假设可以集中访问多领域图数据，但这在实际中往往因隐私和制度约束而不可行。联邦图基础模型解决了这一限制，但其有效性依赖于构建一个既能实现域内语义一致性又能保持域间多样性的全局代码本。

Method: FedBook采用两阶段过程：1) 域内协作 - 通过参考语义更可靠的高频token来精炼低频token以增强域内一致性；2) 域间集成 - 在聚合全局图基础模型时，根据客户端代码本的语义独特性加权其贡献，从而保持跨域多样性。

Result: 在8个基准测试和多个领域任务上的广泛实验表明，FedBook持续优于21个基线方法，包括孤立监督学习、联邦学习/联邦图学习、集中式图基础模型的联邦适应以及联邦图基础模型技术。

Conclusion: FedBook通过系统性的联邦代码本聚合方法，有效解决了联邦图基础模型中的域内一致性和域间多样性平衡问题，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的锐度度量方法——Rényi锐度，基于Rényi熵来衡量损失Hessian矩阵特征值的分布均匀性，并证明了其与泛化能力的强相关性。还提出了Rényi锐度感知最小化(RSAM)训练方法，在多个实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的锐度度量方法与泛化能力的相关性通常不强，有时甚至很弱。为了缩小直觉与现实之间的差距，需要一种更有效的锐度度量方法。

Method: 1) 定义Rényi锐度为损失Hessian矩阵的负Rényi熵；2) 利用Rényi熵简洁地表征损失Hessian特征值的分布程度；3) 提出Rényi锐度感知最小化(RSAM)作为训练正则化方法。

Result: 实验验证了Rényi锐度与泛化能力之间的强相关性（特别是Kendall秩相关）。RSAM方法在所有现有的锐度感知最小化方法中表现最佳，相比经典SAM方法测试准确率提升高达近2.5%。

Conclusion: Rényi锐度是一种有效的泛化能力度量指标，基于此提出的RSAM训练方法能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

<details>

Motivation: 在线广告中，广告主的异构需求产生了大量定制化竞价任务，这些任务通常独立优化，导致计算量大且数据效率低。现有多任务学习方法主要基于训练动态，在波动性竞价环境中泛化能力差。

Method: 提出验证对齐多任务优化(VAMO)，根据每个任务的训练梯度与验证梯度的对齐度自适应分配任务权重，引导更新方向朝向验证集改进。还结合周期性感知时序模块和生成式自动竞价骨干网络，增强跨任务的季节性结构迁移和竞价性能。

Result: 在模拟和真实大规模广告系统上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比典型基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: VAMO方法有效解决了在线广告多任务竞价优化问题，通过验证对齐机制提升了泛化能力和部署效果。

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 在无线联邦学习中，客户端需要通过带宽受限的通道传输高维DNN参数，这导致了通信延迟问题。现有方法为所有DNN层分配相同调制级别，没有考虑各层的重要性差异。

Method: 设计层自适应调制方案，考虑DNN各层的重要性，自动为不同层决定最优调制级别，提供更多自由度来节省延迟。

Conclusion: 层自适应调制方案能有效减少无线联邦学习中的通信延迟，通过考虑DNN层的重要性差异实现更高效的通信。

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

Conclusion: 弱形式方程学习技术能够从高度稀疏的实验数据中学习有效的昆虫种群移动模型，为害虫管理提供预测工具。

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法在让LLMs遗忘敏感信息时，往往会损害模型的原有能力和知识保留。

Method: 采用两步框架，选择性地只更新负责编码遗忘集的关键神经元，限制对这些目标神经元的更新。

Result: SIMU实现了相当的遗忘效果，同时在保留模型原有知识方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 选择性影响机器学习遗忘框架能有效解决遗忘过程中的知识保留问题，提升模型整体效用。

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

Conclusion: MetaDefense通过两阶段防御方法有效抵御微调越狱攻击，为LLM安全提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: 测试时自改进算法展示了构建更强大智能体向自我进化发展的新范式潜力。

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Result: LSR方法在SNR估计中表现最好，优化GPR模型在NV估计中准确率最高；提出的AO-GPRLLSR方法在SEM图像去噪中取得了较低的均方误差。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了SEM图像的SNR和NV估计，通过NV引导的维纳滤波器有效提升了图像质量，为SEM图像处理提供了更鲁棒和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MMM框架，通过整合三维量子化学信息（电子定位函数ELF）来改进药物表示学习，结合全局电子特性和局部子结构交互，显著提升药物相互作用预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的方法使用简化的离散形式表示药物结构，无法充分捕捉分子结合亲和力和反应性，药物-药物相互作用风险仍是临床决策支持系统的重要挑战

Method: MMM框架生成3D电子密度图（使用ELF），结合ELF衍生的全局电子特性特征和二分图编码器建模局部子结构交互，学习药物分子的互补特性

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上评估，与基于GNN的SafeDrug模型相比，F1分数(p=0.0387)、Jaccard(p=0.0112)和DDI率(p=0.0386)均有统计学显著提升

Conclusion: 基于ELF的3D表示有潜力提高预测准确性，支持临床实践中更安全的组合药物处方

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

*Murtaza Rangwala,Farag Azzedin,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SketchGuard是一个去中心化联邦学习的拜占庭鲁棒防御框架，通过草图压缩技术将高维模型压缩为低维草图进行邻居筛选，大幅降低了通信和计算开销，同时保持了与现有方法相同的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拜占庭鲁棒DFL防御方法需要每个客户端在每轮训练中与所有邻居交换和比较完整的高维模型向量，产生了过高的通信和计算成本，阻碍了在web规模上的部署。

Method: 使用Count Sketch将d维模型压缩到k维草图（k << d）进行相似性比较，然后仅从被接受的邻居处选择性获取完整模型，将每轮通信复杂度从O(d|N_i|)降低到O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|)。

Result: 在多个数据集、网络拓扑和攻击场景下的综合实验表明，SketchGuard保持了与最先进方法相同的鲁棒性，同时将计算时间减少高达82%，通信开销减少50-70%，且收益随模型维度和网络连通性呈乘数增长。

Conclusion: 基于草图压缩的方法为实现web规模的鲁棒去中心化联邦学习提供了可行的基础支持。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SNN时间特性的自蒸馏方法，将SNN在不同时间步的实例视为子模型，通过识别强弱关系实现高效的自蒸馏训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SNN知识蒸馏方法依赖大型教师模型或引入额外训练开销，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 将SNN分解为多个时间步子模型，评估其输出置信度识别强弱关系，提出Strong2Weak和Weak2Strong两种自蒸馏方案，支持集成、同步和级联蒸馏。

Result: 有效提升了SNN的判别能力和整体性能，同时增强了对抗鲁棒性，受益于自蒸馏带来的稳定性。

Conclusion: 巧妙利用了SNN的时间特性，为高效训练高性能SNN提供了新思路。

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进神经网络风险证书的实用性，特别是针对PAC-Bayes边界在神经网络中的应用，以提供更紧的泛化保证。

Method: 1) 推导伯努利分布KL散度的两个边界；2) 基于隐式微分的形式化高效方法；3) 非可微目标（如0-1损失）边界优化方法；4) 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实证评估。

Result: 实现了神经网络在CIFAR-10上的首个非平凡泛化边界，提供了更紧的风险证书。

Conclusion: 提出的理论贡献显著提升了PAC-Bayes风险证书在神经网络中的实用性，为深度学习的泛化理论提供了重要进展。

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCO提出了一种新的模型评估方法，通过选择模型响应分歧最大的样本来预测最终性能，避免了传统聚类方法的复杂性，在多个基准测试中取得最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型评估成本过高，传统方法依赖聚类选择锚点子集，过程复杂且对设计选择敏感。作者认为样本多样性不重要，重要的是最大化模型响应的多样性。

Method: DISCO方法选择模型响应分歧最大的前k个样本，使用贪心的样本级统计而非全局聚类，理论证明模型间分歧提供了信息论最优的贪心选择规则。

Result: 在MMLU、Hellaswag、Winogrande和ARC等基准测试中，DISCO在性能预测方面优于先前方法，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DISCO提供了一种概念更简单、理论更优的模型评估方法，通过最大化模型响应分歧来选择样本，显著降低了评估成本。

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

TL;DR: PRESCRIBE是一个多变量深度证据回归框架，用于单细胞扰动预测中联合测量模型不确定性和数据不确定性，通过置信度评分提高预测可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞扰动预测需要预测训练数据中未见基因的扰动效果，其可靠性取决于两个因素：目标基因与训练基因的相似性（模型不确定性）和训练数据质量（数据不确定性），这两种不确定性对确定预测可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出了PRESCRIBE（PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation），一个多变量深度证据回归框架，旨在联合测量这两种不确定性来源。

Result: PRESCRIBE能有效估计每个预测的置信度评分，该评分与经验准确性高度相关，能够过滤不可靠结果，在实验中相比可比基线实现了超过3%的稳定准确率提升。

Conclusion: PRESCRIBE框架通过联合测量模型和数据不确定性，为单细胞扰动预测提供了可靠的置信度评估，显著提高了预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一个多智能体强化学习框架，集成高效气候代理模型来替代计算昂贵的气候模拟器，实现多气体动态下的区域气候政策学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候政策研究需要能够捕捉多种温室气体对全球温度综合影响的模型，但这些模型计算成本高昂，难以嵌入强化学习系统。

Method: 使用在20,000条多气体排放路径上预训练的循环神经网络架构，替代CICERO-SCM气候模型，构建高精度、高效率的气候代理模型。

Result: 代理模型达到接近模拟器的精度（全球平均温度RMSE≈0.0004K），推理速度提升约1000倍，在气候政策MARL设置中端到端训练加速超过100倍。

Conclusion: 该方法能够绕过核心计算瓶颈而不牺牲政策保真度，支持大规模多智能体实验，涵盖多气体动态和高保真气候响应的替代气候政策机制。

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

TL;DR: 本文首次揭示了现代LLM剪枝方法可能被恶意利用的安全漏洞，攻击者可以构建看似良性的模型，但在剪枝后表现出恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型剪枝已成为减少大语言模型推理时内存占用的主要方法，但其安全影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 攻击者计算每个参数被剪枝的概率，将恶意行为注入到不太可能被剪枝的参数中，然后使用可能被剪枝的参数修复模型，从而在未剪枝模型中抵消注入的行为。

Result: 在五个模型上的广泛评估显示，应用vLLM中的剪枝方法后，模型在各种攻击场景中持续表现出强烈的恶意行为（越狱成功率高达95.7%，良性指令拒绝率98.7%，目标内容注入成功率99.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了关键部署时安全漏洞，强调了在模型压缩中加强安全意识的紧迫性。

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中过拟合问题，特别是针对数据异常值、噪声和有限训练数据的情况。现有D2C方法的聚合策略未能充分利用子模型泛化能力的差异信息。

Method: 在D2C基础上引入动态不确定性感知聚合，基于子模型在共享验证集上的准确率和预测不确定性动态加权，使中心模型优先学习泛化能力更强、置信度更高的子模型。

Conclusion: DUA-D2C是一个理论基础扎实且有效的深度学习方法，能有效对抗过拟合问题。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

Conclusion: 检查点回收方法为经济高效的大语言模型预训练奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界图上验证了高效性，早期阶段即表现出显著收敛，成功解决了文献中的开放猜想。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Conclusion: 该方法能够直接从信道传播序列恢复轨迹，无需位置标定，在复杂室内环境下实现高精度定位和无线电地图构建。

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理解模型合并中后门攻击的框架，将攻击视为任务向量，并开发了新的攻击方法(SBV)和防御方法(IBVS)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并虽然有效，但存在严重的安全风险，特别是容易受到后门攻击。现有研究显示攻击者可以通过在单个微调模型中植入隐藏触发器来控制最终合并模型的输出。

Method: 提出了后门向量(BV)概念，计算后门模型与干净模型的权重差异；开发了稀疏后门向量(SBV)攻击方法，将多个攻击合并为单一攻击；提出了注入后门向量减法(IBVS)防御方法。

Result: SBV方法超越了之前的攻击效果，是首个利用合并来提升后门有效性的方法；IBVS提供了轻量级通用防御，即使在完全未知后门威胁时仍保持有效。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了模型合并中后门威胁的核心漏洞，并提供了新的攻击理解和防御框架，为模型合并的安全性研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

*Akira Ito,Masanori Yamada,Daiki Chijiwa,Atsutoshi Kumagai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，仅通过加宽模型并使用合适的softmax温度校准，无需参数排列即可实现线性模式连接(LMC)，这归因于层间指数加权连接(LEWC)机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究认为实现LMC需要参数排列搜索和足够宽的模型，本研究旨在验证仅通过模型加宽是否足以实现LMC。

Method: 使用softmax温度校准，分析中间层输出，引入层间指数加权连接(LEWC)概念来解释现象。

Result: 实证证明即使没有参数排列，仅通过加宽模型和合适的温度校准就能实现LMC，LEWC机制使得合并模型的输出等同于原始模型的集成。

Conclusion: 模型加宽不仅促进非线性模式连接，也显著提高了实现线性模式连接的可能性，这是首次揭示这一现象的研究。

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

TL;DR: 提出分层预填充调度方法，通过将Transformer层组作为调度单元，在保持无停顿解码的同时消除MoE模型中的权重重载开销，显著降低延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块预填充调度方法虽然能稳定TBT，但在MoE模型中导致大量专家权重重载，增加内存流量和能耗。

Method: 将模型垂直划分为连续层组，在层组间交错进行预填充和解码，避免分块引起的MoE权重重载。

Result: 降低片外带宽需求，TTFT减少70%，端到端延迟降低41%，每token能耗降低22%。

Conclusion: 将调度轴从token转向层组，为共置环境中的高效、节能LLM服务开辟了新操作模式。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

Motivation: 主体特异性分布偏移是EEG解码基础模型开发的重要障碍，需要解决主体间变异性问题。

Method: 设计自适应层作为标准线性或卷积层的替代，将权重分解为共享的主体不变组件和轻量级低秩校正，分离通用知识与个性化适配。

Result: 配备该层的模型在性能上优于仅共享权重的模型和单独训练的主体特定模型的平均值。

Conclusion: Subject-Conditioned Layer为构建有效的跨主体EEG基础模型提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

Motivation: 现有近似遗忘方法主要关注类别遗忘，但在实际应用中仅遗忘对象类别往往不够。例如自动驾驶系统需要准确识别真实汽车，同时避免将路边广告中的插图汽车误认为真实汽车。

Method: 提出新方法显式解耦领域分布并自适应捕获实例特定的领域信息，克服预训练VLM中领域分布高度纠缠的问题。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在基于VLM调优技术构建的基线方法上表现更优。

Conclusion: 为VLM中实用和细粒度的遗忘铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法存在熵崩溃问题，导致探索消失和策略过早收敛，而现有的熵正则化方法只能部分缓解问题且引入偏差和不稳定性。

Method: AEPO通过用温度调整分布的REINFORCE策略梯度替代熵奖励，结合策略梯度正则化、分布正则化和REINFORCE正则化三个关键设计，实现精确的熵控制。

Conclusion: AEPO解决了熵崩溃问题，阐明了熵、探索和推理性能之间的关系，并为强化学习微调提供了更通用的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

Motivation: 现代推理模型具有新兴的置信度校准特性，可以利用这一特性在模型早期获得正确答案时停止推理，从而节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 基于熵的置信度校准是高级后训练优化模型的新兴特性，可有效用于提高推理效率，而标准指令调优和预训练模型缺乏这一特性。

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

Conclusion: GALA框架能够有效处理大规模异构源域的UMDA问题，提供稳定且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

Conclusion: MORE作为长尾设置中的稳健即插即用模块具有潜力，通过直接重新平衡模型参数空间来缓解不平衡问题。

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

*Feng Hong,Yu Huang,Zihua Zhao,Zhihan Zhou,Jiangchao Yao,Dongsheng Li,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了D-SINK框架，通过整合专门处理类别不平衡和标签噪声的辅助模型，增强深度学习模型对长尾噪声数据的双重鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集经常同时面临类别不平衡和标签噪声的挑战，现有方法难以有效结合处理这两个问题，因为区分真正的尾部样本和噪声数据很困难，往往导致优化策略冲突。

Method: 提出D-SINK框架，利用最优传输优化的代理标签分配，将目标模型的样本级预测与噪声鲁棒辅助模型对齐，将类别分布与不平衡鲁棒辅助模型对齐。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，D-SINK显著提高了鲁棒性，在处理长尾噪声数据学习方面取得了强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: 通过协同利用专门处理单一问题的'弱'辅助模型，可以有效地增强模型对类别不平衡和标签噪声的双重鲁棒性，D-SINK框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了船舶燃料消耗预测的新数据集和标准化基准，并首次在该领域应用TabPFN基础模型进行上下文学习。结果表明，包含环境条件的模型优于仅依赖船速的基准模型，TabPFN表现最佳，且时间上下文能提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航运业中燃料消耗和排放对经济效率和环境可持续性至关重要，但异构方法和有限的高质量数据集阻碍了建模方法的直接比较。

Method: 引入新数据集，定义标准化基准（表格回归和时间序列回归），并首次应用TabPFN基础模型进行上下文学习来建模船舶燃料消耗。

Result: 所有评估模型均表现出色，支持船上数据驱动燃料预测的可行性。包含环境条件的模型始终优于仅依赖船速的简单多项式基准。TabPFN略微优于其他技术，且包含时间上下文能提高准确性。

Conclusion: 基础模型在表格预测中具有潜力，上下文学习能力在该领域展现出应用前景，时间信息的整合能进一步提升预测精度。

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVOR是一种可扩展的离线强化学习方法，通过结合表达性策略和价值函数，避免了蒸馏和反向传播时间的问题，在推理时通过拒绝采样实现高效策略提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在机器人领域尚未充分发挥潜力，主要因为可扩展性问题。现有方法依赖计算昂贵的BPTT或引入复合误差的策略蒸馏，限制了向更复杂数据集的扩展。

Method: EVOR通过流匹配学习最优正则化Q函数，在推理时使用表达性价值函数进行拒绝采样来实现策略提取，无需重新训练即可实现高效优化和计算可扩展搜索。

Result: 实验表明，EVOR在多种离线强化学习任务上优于基线方法，证明了将表达性价值学习整合到离线强化学习中的优势。

Conclusion: EVOR提供了一种无需蒸馏或BPTT的可扩展离线强化学习方法，通过表达性价值函数和推理时策略提取实现了更好的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

*Wiktor Jan Hoffmann,Sonia Laguna,Moritz Vandenhirtz,Emanuele Palumbo,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PSCBMs方法，通过添加小型协方差预测模块，为预训练的CBM增加概念间的多元正态分布建模，无需重新训练主干模型，提高了概念和目标准确性，特别是在干预情况下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模概念依赖性的方法通常需要重新训练整个模型，这在原始数据或计算资源有限时不可行。

Method: 提出后验随机概念瓶颈模型(PSCBMs)，在预训练的CBM基础上添加协方差预测模块，构建概念间的多元正态分布，无需重新训练主干模型。

Result: PSCBMs在真实数据上一致匹配或优于标准CBM的概念和目标准确性，在干预情况下表现显著更好，且比从头训练类似随机模型更高效。

Conclusion: PSCBMs是一种轻量级方法，能够有效建模概念依赖关系，提高CBM性能，特别是在干预场景下，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

*Michal Koren,Or Peretz,Tai Dinh,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了不确定性感知马尔可夫决策过程（UAMDP），将贝叶斯预测、后验采样强化学习和条件风险价值约束规划相结合，用于波动环境中的序列决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波动性高、风险大的环境中进行序列决策不仅需要最大化期望收益，还需要进行原则性的不确定性管理。

Method: UAMDP框架结合贝叶斯预测、后验采样强化学习和条件风险价值约束规划，在闭环中更新潜在动态信念，通过Thompson采样生成合理未来情景，并在预设风险容忍度下优化策略。

Result: 在高频股票交易和零售库存控制两个领域，UAMDP相比强深度学习基线，长期预测准确率显著提升（RMSE降低达25%，sMAPE降低32%），交易夏普比率从1.54提升至1.74，最大回撤约减半。

Conclusion: 整合校准概率建模、与后验不确定性对齐的探索以及风险感知控制，能够产生稳健、可泛化的方法，实现更安全、更有利可图的序列决策。

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DMPO方法，一种专门为扩散大语言模型设计的强化学习微调方法，通过分布匹配框架显著提升推理能力，在多个基准测试中准确率提升高达42.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)是自回归大语言模型(AR-LLMs)的有前景替代方案，具有更高的推理吞吐量。但需要专门的强化学习算法来使其在推理等关键任务上达到与AR-LLMs相当的性能。

Method: 提出了分布匹配策略优化(DMPO)，通过交叉熵优化将dLLM策略分布与最优奖励倾斜分布匹配。针对小批量训练挑战，提出了新颖的权重基线减法技术。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现出优越性能，无需监督微调，准确率比之前SOTA基线提升高达42.9%，比基础模型提升55.8%。

Conclusion: 分布匹配框架对提升dLLMs推理能力非常有效，DMPO为dLLMs提供了专门的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究使用政治指南针测试评估了8个主流大语言模型的政治偏见和刻板印象传播，发现所有模型都呈现左倾政治倾向，且通过语言变化引发的隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在社会信息传播和决策过程中的作用日益重要，理解其政治偏见对于防止对公众舆论和民主进程产生不当影响至关重要。

Method: 使用二维政治指南针测试评估模型固有政治倾向，通过角色提示探索显性刻板印象，使用多语言版本测试揭示隐性刻板印象。

Result: 所有被调查模型都呈现一致的左倾政治倾向；不同模型的刻板印象性质和程度差异很大；隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显；大多数模型的隐性和显性刻板印象存在显著一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大语言模型中政治偏见和刻板印象的复杂相互作用，表明模型对其固有偏见具有一定程度的透明度或"意识"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实环境中的部署增多，多智能体交互不可避免。需要了解LLM智能体是否能够像强化学习智能体一样，仅通过交互就能塑造其他智能体的学习动态和行为。

Method: 提出ShapeLLM方法，这是针对基于transformer的智能体量身定制的模型无关对手塑造方法的适配版本，解决了现有方法无法直接应用于LLM的问题。

Result: LLM智能体能够在竞争性游戏中成功引导对手走向可被利用的均衡，在合作性游戏中促进协调并提高集体福利，证明了LLM智能体既能塑造也能被塑造。

Conclusion: LLM智能体能够通过互动影响其他智能体的学习动态，确立了对手塑造作为多智能体LLM研究的关键维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Mix-和MoE-DPO框架，通过软混合模型和专家混合架构扩展DPO，使用随机变分推理方法解决单模型DPO在多任务设置中的表达能力限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖单一模型，限制了在多任务环境中的表达能力以及对异构或多样化偏好分布的适应性。

Method: 引入潜在变量模型进行专家分配，优化变分证据下界，支持共享基础架构与专家特定策略头以及完全独立的专家模型。

Result: 在多种模型大小和多偏好数据集上验证，证明Mix-和MoE-DPO为基于偏好的LLM对齐提供了强大且可扩展的方法。

Conclusion: Mix-和MoE-DPO通过混合泛化、专家专业化和上下文对齐，提供了比标准DPO更优的偏好学习能力。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 本文解决了高维多元结果的反事实识别问题，使用连续时间流方法在非马尔可夫设置下建立识别基础，确保反事实推理的一致性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实推理方法缺乏识别性，削弱了因果估计的有效性。Pearl(2000)指出反事实必须可识别才能证明因果主张，因此需要建立可靠的识别基础。

Method: 使用连续时间流匹配方法，结合动态最优传输工具，构建唯一、单调且保秩的反事实传输映射。

Result: 在具有反事实真实值的受控场景中验证了理论，并在真实图像上展示了反事实公理合理性的改进。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为高维多元结果的反事实识别提供了理论基础，确保了反事实推理的因果有效性。

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

Motivation: 传统时间序列生成方法往往忽略领域特定的物理约束，限制了统计和物理一致性。

Method: 使用傅里叶神经算子学习物理算子，结合条件流匹配进行概率生成，通过时间依赖的分层约束和FNO引导的校正进行集成。

Result: 在谐振子、人类活动识别和锂离子电池退化实验中，相比基线方法，生成质量提高16.3%，物理违规减少46%，预测准确率提升18.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将物理归纳偏置引入生成模型，显著提升了生成质量和物理一致性。

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

Motivation: 随着AI成为6G网络控制的核心组件，AI模型需要适应不断变化的环境条件，包括多供应商部署、硬件升级和服务需求演进带来的新特征和测量需求。

Method: 采用自适应随机森林（ARFs）进行迭代训练以实现动态特征适应，并提出漂移感知特征重要性（DAFI）方法，使用分布漂移检测器来决定何时应用计算密集型特征重要性方法。

Result: 测试表明，ARFs能够随着特征增加逐步提高预测准确性，DAFI方法可将运行时间减少最多2倍，同时产生更一致的特征重要性值。

Conclusion: ARFs和DAFI共同提供了一个有前景的框架，用于构建适应6G网络用例的灵活AI方法。

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

Motivation: 解决协作机器学习中对抗行为的容忍问题，现有方法要么依赖中央服务器，要么通信成本过高。

Method: 采用拉取式流行病通信策略，从随机节点子集拉取模型参数，无需中央服务器，降低通信成本。

Result: 在对抗环境下保持鲁棒性，通信精度与全连接通信相当，在大规模网络中高效扩展。

Conclusion: RPEL提供了一种可扩展的分布式鲁棒学习方法，在保证收敛性的同时显著降低通信开销。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Learning to Defer (LtD)方法将人类和ML模型视为互斥决策者，限制了专家贡献仅为预测。需要更有效的人类-AI协作框架。

Method: 基于两阶段架构：标准ML模型和带专家反馈的增强模型，提供顺序训练和联合训练两种实现方式，设计了具有可实现一致性保证的代理损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实专家数据上的实验表明，LtA为有效的人类-AI协作提供了更灵活和强大的基础。

Conclusion: LtA框架能够更好地处理何时以及如何整合专家输入，相比传统方法提供了更有效的人类-AI协作解决方案。

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，证明了单层注意力Transformer的维度边界，并发现模型在短序列上的平衡logit位移可泛化到长序列但精度下降。研究还发现dropout和EMA分别能缓解softmax压缩和训练噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，这对于棋盘游戏式推理至关重要，因为模型需要预测输入序列中缺失的token的均匀分布。

Method: 通过理论分析单层注意力Transformer的维度边界，证明在短序列上的平衡logit位移可泛化到长序列。提出dropout对抗softmax压缩效应，EMA对抗训练噪声。在集合补集任务和OthelloGPT上进行实验验证。

Result: 理论证明单层注意力Transformer在短序列上的平衡logit位移可泛化到长序列但精度下降。实验验证dropout和EMA分别能有效改善长度泛化，在OthelloGPT中也观察到EMA的积极效果。

Conclusion: Transformer在集合补集任务中存在长度泛化挑战，主要受softmax压缩和训练噪声影响。dropout和EMA是有效的缓解策略，为改进Transformer的长度泛化能力提供了理论指导和实用方法。

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

TL;DR: DeepEN是一个基于深度强化学习的肠内营养个性化推荐框架，在ICU重症患者中提供每4小时定制的热量、蛋白质和液体摄入建议，相比临床指南方法可降低3.7%的死亡率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统肠内营养治疗主要依赖指南或启发式方法，缺乏对患者个体生理状态变化的动态适应，需要开发能够根据患者实时生理状态进行个性化营养治疗的数据驱动方法。

Method: 使用来自MIMIC-IV数据库的11,000多名ICU患者数据进行离线训练，结合临床信息的状态空间和定制奖励函数，采用双深度Q网络与保守Q学习正则化方法，平衡短期生理目标和长期生存结果。

Result: DeepEN在各项定性和定量指标上均优于临床医生和指南策略，死亡率降低3.7个百分点（18.8% vs 22.5%），关键营养生物标志物也有所改善。

Conclusion: 研究表明，安全的数据驱动肠内营养个性化治疗有潜力超越传统方法，改善患者预后。

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的采样算法，通过轻量级微调单个层和智能重掩码调度器，显著提升预训练掩码扩散模型的采样质量和效率，特别是在低步数生成场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练掩码扩散模型的性能受限于其采样过程，该过程决策不可逆且在低步数生成时表现不佳。

Method: 采用星形生成范式，结合可学习的重掩码调度器来识别和修正潜在错误，仅需微调单个层。

Result: 在文本和代码生成任务中，该采样算法优于或匹配现有方法，尤其在少步数采样时带来显著质量提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了掩码扩散模型采样过程中的不可逆决策问题，实现了更高效和高质量的生成。

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

Motivation: 对比学习在自监督表示学习中显示出潜力，但其在资源受限设备上的部署尚未充分探索。传统CL框架的高计算需求在能耗、数据可用性和内存使用方面带来挑战。

Method: 系统评估四种广泛使用的CL框架（SimCLR、MoCo、SimSiam和Barlow Twins），采用包含能耗分析和减少训练数据条件的基准测试策略，并评估轻量级神经网络架构与CL框架的配对。

Result: 研究发现SimCLR尽管被认为计算成本高，但在各种数据条件下表现出最低的能耗。

Conclusion: 该研究为在边缘/雾环境中部署对比学习提供了资源影响方面的见解，并为其未来优化开辟了多个研究方向。

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

Abstract: In this paper we will give a characterization of the learnability of
forgiving 0-1 loss functions in the finite label multiclass setting. To do
this, we create a new combinatorial dimension that is based off of the
Natarajan Dimension \citep{natarajan1989learning} and we show that a hypothesis
class is learnable in our setting if and only if this Generalized Natarajan

TL;DR: FlyLoRA是一种基于果蝇嗅觉回路启发的LoRA变体，通过隐式MoE架构和随机投影矩阵解决参数干扰问题，在多个领域实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，导致性能不佳。MoE-based LoRA变体虽然能缓解单任务内的相关性，但在多任务模型合并中仍然存在任务间干扰，且需要额外路由参数。

Method: 提出FlyLoRA方法：1）在up-projection矩阵中引入rank-wise专家激活；2）使用隐式路由器统一专家路由和down-projection，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统的密集可训练版本。

Result: 在四个领域（通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理、代码生成）的广泛实验显示，相比现有方法实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA不仅提供了实证性能增益，还展示了生物结构如何启发AI技术创新。该方法消除了显式路由器的需求，同时由于随机矩阵的正交性特性，固有地缓解了任务间干扰。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究测试了四种深度学习超分辨率模型（RCAN、pix2pix、FSRCNN、CycleGAN）来提升牙本质孔隙网络成像质量，发现传统图像质量评估指标与视觉感知不一致，提出基于生物学结构的评估方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前牙本质孔隙网络成像受限于共聚焦显微镜的高分辨率要求，导致视野范围极小。需要开发能够通过后处理恢复图像质量的超分辨率方法，以加快实验采集速度。

Method: 使用四种深度学习超分辨率模型（三种监督式：RCAN、pix2pix、FSRCNN；一种无监督：CycleGAN）处理配对的低分辨率和高分辨率共聚焦图像，通过2×、4×、8×像素尺寸增加进行测试。

Result: 传统图像质量评估指标结果不一致且与视觉感知矛盾，而基于孔隙网络结构和3D连通性的生物学驱动评估方法能更好地解释模型性能差异，揭示模型对弱强度特征的敏感性和图像生成非线性的影响。

Conclusion: 针对特定生物结构（如牙本质孔隙网络）的超分辨率模型评估需要采用基于生物学特征的定制化方法，而非依赖通用的图像质量评估指标。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

TL;DR: 本文通过引入基于困惑度的正则化来改进提示优化的泛化边界，在数据稀缺情况下提供非空泛的理论保证，并实证验证困惑度正则化能提升提示泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示工程技术的成功实践与理论分析存在差距，特别是在数据稀缺场景下，现有的PAC-Bayes泛化边界往往过于空泛，无法充分解释提示优化的广泛成功。

Method: 提出基于困惑度的数据依赖先验，推导出适用于数据稀缺场景的非空泛泛化边界，并通过困惑度正则化限制提示搜索空间来收紧边界。

Result: 理论分析表明困惑度正则化能有效收紧泛化边界，实证研究验证了困惑度正则化在提升提示泛化性能方面的实际效果。

Conclusion: 困惑度作为有效先验能更好地解释提示优化的成功，提出的泛化边界为数据稀缺场景下的提示优化提供了理论支撑，困惑度正则化是提升提示泛化性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

<details>

Motivation: 现有GRPO等方法在扩散模型中需要随机策略，但最高效的扩散采样器基于确定性ODE，导致效率与随机性需求冲突。

Method: DGPO直接基于组级偏好进行学习，无需策略梯度框架，允许使用高效的确定性ODE采样器。

Result: 训练速度比现有最优方法快约20倍，在领域内和领域外奖励指标上均表现更优。

Conclusion: DGPO通过消除对随机策略的依赖，成功解决了扩散模型中强化学习的效率瓶颈问题。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

TL;DR: ClauseLens是一个基于条款的强化学习框架，用于生成透明、合规且风险感知的再保险条约报价，显著减少违规并提高尾部风险管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前再保险条约定价实践不透明且难以审计，需要满足严格的监管标准。

Method: 将报价任务建模为风险感知约束马尔可夫决策过程(RA-CMDP)，从法律和承保语料库中检索法定和政策条款，嵌入到智能体观察中，用于约束可行动作并生成基于条款的自然语言解释。

Result: 在多智能体条约模拟器中，ClauseLens将偿付能力违规减少51%，尾部风险表现提高27.9%(CVaR_0.10)，基于条款的解释准确率达88.2%，检索精度87.4%，召回率91.1%。

Conclusion: 将法律背景嵌入决策和解释路径可以产生可解释、可审计且符合监管要求的报价行为，与Solvency II、NAIC RBC和欧盟AI法案一致。

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临成本与性能的权衡：高端模型性能强但昂贵，轻量级模型经济但处理复杂任务能力弱。现有的静态升级规则和关键词启发式方法无法充分利用这一频谱，也无法跨任务类型自适应。

Method: 开发了基于工具调用的路由系统xRouter，使用强化学习端到端训练路由器，路由器可以直接回答或调用外部模型。系统包含完整的强化学习框架、奖励和成本核算，以及部署和评估流程。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，xRouter实现了强大的成本-性能权衡（例如在保持相似任务完成率的同时大幅降低成本），并为学习路由提供了实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter为推进学习型、成本感知的LLM编排提供了实用基础，这些发现和开源实现将促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 图神经网络在消息传递机制中面临过度压缩问题，即来自大感受野的节点信息被压缩到固定大小的向量中，造成信息瓶颈。现有测量方法存在局限性，需要从存储和检索容量的角度重新分析这一问题。

Method: 引入模型存储和检索容量的概念，开发新的合成任务来测量过度压缩；借鉴序列建模中的关联记忆、快速权重编程器和xLSTM模型思想，提出具有改进容量的新型GNN架构。

Conclusion: 通过存储和检索容量的视角重新审视过度压缩问题，并基于关联记忆思想提出的新GNN架构能够有效缓解信息瓶颈问题，在合成任务和真实基准测试中均取得良好效果。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活函数比较主要基于启发式方法，缺乏严格的理论框架来指导激活函数的选择和设计。

Method: 使用九维积分签名S_sigma(phi)框架，包含高斯传播统计(m1,g1,g2,m2,eta)、渐近斜率(alpha_plus,alpha_minus)和正则性度量(TV(phi'),C(phi))，进行动态分析和核视角分析。

Conclusion: 该框架为激活函数选择提供了原则性设计指导，将激活函数选择从试错方法转向可证明的稳定性和核条件。

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法忽略了任务固有的主观性，直接回归多个标注者的平均分数，无法反映不同人类视角对好摘要的多样性偏好。

Method: 首次在视频摘要中采用扩散模型，提出SummDiff方法，根据输入视频动态适应视觉上下文，生成多个候选摘要。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，生成的摘要与个体标注者偏好更接近，并通过新的背包分析指标提供更深入洞察。

Conclusion: 将视频摘要重新定义为条件生成任务，使用扩散模型能够更好地捕捉和反映人类标注的主观多样性，为视频摘要研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了In-Context Clustering (ICC)，一种基于LLM的灵活聚类方法，能够处理来自不同分布的数据，通过注意力机制捕捉复杂关系，并支持文本条件图像聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法受限于预定义的相似性度量，无法灵活捕捉输入之间的复杂关系，而LLM的注意力机制和上下文学习能力为无监督聚类提供了新的可能性。

Method: 使用预训练LLM的注意力矩阵进行谱聚类，并通过Next Token Prediction (NTP)损失对数值和图像数据进行微调，支持文本条件图像聚类。

Result: LLM在文本编码的数值数据上展现出令人印象深刻的零样本聚类能力，注意力矩阵显示出明显的聚类模式，谱聚类性能具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 将上下文学习扩展到无监督设置，展示了LLM在聚类任务中的有效性和灵活性，为传统聚类方法提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: UML是一种模态无关的训练范式，通过交替处理不同模态的输入并共享参数，利用未配对的辅助多模态数据来增强目标模态的表征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习依赖配对数据集，但能否利用未配对的辅助多模态数据直接增强目标模态的表征学习是一个被忽视但具有潜力的问题。

Method: 提出UML：未配对多模态学习器，采用模态无关的训练范式，单个模型交替处理不同模态的输入，同时跨模态共享参数，利用不同模态是共享底层现实的投影这一假设。

Result: 理论上在线性数据生成假设下，未配对的辅助数据可以产生比单模态训练更丰富的数据生成过程表征。实证表明，使用文本、音频或图像等辅助模态的未配对数据，能持续提升图像和音频等单模态目标的下游性能。

Conclusion: UML证明了未配对多模态数据可以有效增强单模态表征学习，为利用丰富但未配对的跨模态数据提供了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

TL;DR: DYNAMIX是一个基于强化学习的批量大小优化框架，使用PPO算法将批量大小选择建模为序列决策问题，在异构动态计算环境中实现自适应优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布式机器学习批量大小选择方法采用静态分配或简单启发式策略，无法适应异构、动态的计算环境，导致训练效率低下。

Method: 使用PPO强化学习算法，构建包含网络指标、系统资源利用率和训练统计效率指标的多维状态表示，实现无需显式系统建模的自适应批量大小优化。

Result: 在多样化工作负载、硬件配置和网络条件下，DYNAMIX实现了最终模型精度提升6.3%，总训练时间减少46%，在32节点集群上保持最佳性能，且学习策略能有效迁移到相关模型架构。

Conclusion: DYNAMIX证明了强化学习在分布式训练批量大小优化中的有效性，能够自适应动态环境，显著提升训练效率和模型性能，具有良好的可扩展性和迁移能力。

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法只关注期望回报，忽略了学习策略的其他特性，难以表征学习到的策略及其行为。

Method: 使用熵正则化和温度解耦策略，在正则化温度趋近于零时实现可解释且保持多样性的最优策略。

Result: 该方法能保证收敛到特定的最优策略，并确保策略衍生对象（价值函数和回报分布）的收敛性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架实现了可解释、保持多样性的最优策略，并能准确估计相关回报分布。

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为RLVR（使用可验证奖励的强化学习）建立了理论框架，分析了其训练过程，提出了梯度间隙概念，并推导了收敛条件和关键步长阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR使用简单的二元反馈来后训练大语言模型，在实践中取得了显著成功，但缺乏对其工作原理的理论理解。

Method: 在完整响应（轨迹）和令牌级别分析RLVR训练过程，引入梯度间隙概念，证明收敛依赖于更新方向与梯度间隙的对齐，并推导基于梯度间隙大小的步长阈值。

Result: 理论预测了关键步长如何随响应长度和成功率缩放，解释了长度归一化等实用启发式方法改善稳定性的原因，并显示固定学习率下成功率可能停滞在100%以下。通过受控老虎机模拟和LLM实验验证了这些预测。

Conclusion: 为RLVR建立了坚实的理论基础，揭示了其收敛机制和稳定性条件，为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

TL;DR: ERA是一种通过设计特殊激活函数来约束模型输出采样熵的新范式，在LLM、强化学习和图像分类等多个领域显著提升性能，计算开销低于7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在采样过程中缺乏有效的熵控制机制，导致性能不稳定或次优。需要一种简单有效的方法来约束输出熵，提升模型鲁棒性和性能。

Method: 设计特殊的输出激活函数，将模型输出的采样熵约束在给定阈值之上，通过熵控制来优化采样过程。

Result: 1) Qwen2.5-Math-7B在AIME 2025上提升37.4%；2) 强化学习在HumanoidBench上比SAC提升30%以上；3) ResNet-50在ImageNet上提升0.69% top-1准确率。

Conclusion: 输出激活是熵控制的有效工具，为设计更简单和鲁棒的算法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We propose ERA, a new paradigm that constrains the sampling entropy above
given thresholds by applying specially designed activations to the outputs of

1) for large language models(LLMs), boosting the AIME 2025 score for
Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 37.4%; 2) for continuous control reinforcement learning
agents, improving performance by more than 30% over strong baselines such as
SAC on the challenging HumanoidBench; 3) for image classification, enhancing
ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 0.69% for ResNet-50. These gains are achieved with a
computational overhead of less than 7%. Our work validates output activation as
a powerful tool for entropy control, opening a new direction for designing
simpler and more robust algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GDPO算法，通过半确定性蒙特卡洛方案降低ELBO估计器方差，在扩散语言模型的强化学习微调中取得优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型具有并行生成和迭代优化的优势，但难以进行强化学习微调，因为其似然函数难以处理。现有方法如diffu-GRPO存在严重偏差，而基于ELBO的方法虽然数学基础更严谨，但计算成本过高。

Method: 重新审视ELBO估计，分解其方差来源，提出通过快速确定性积分近似来降低方差。开发了Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO)算法，利用半确定性蒙特卡洛方案缓解双蒙特卡洛采样下的方差爆炸问题。

Result: GDPO在数学、推理和编程基准测试中，相比预训练检查点持续提升性能，并在大多数任务上优于当前最先进的diffu-GRPO基线方法。

Conclusion: GDPO为扩散语言模型的强化学习微调提供了一个有效且计算高效的解决方案，通过降低ELBO估计器方差实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为Linearizer的架构，通过将线性算子夹在两个可逆神经网络之间，使非线性函数在特定向量空间中表现为线性，从而将线性代数工具应用于非线性映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何为传统非线性函数识别非标准向量空间对，使其在这些空间中表现为线性，从而扩展线性代数工具在神经网络中的应用。

Method: 使用Linearizer架构：f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x))，其中A是线性算子，g_x和g_y是可逆神经网络，通过新定义的加法和缩放操作诱导向量空间。

Result: 证明了两个共享神经网络的Linearizer组合仍是Linearizer；在扩散模型中应用可使数百个采样步骤简化为单步；实现了全局投影生成模型和模块化风格迁移。

Conclusion: Linearizer框架成功地将线性代数工具应用于非线性映射，在扩散模型、投影生成和风格迁移等任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模经验模型与形式验证之间的鸿沟，减少语言模型生成中的事实错误（幻觉），同时保持模型效率。

Method: 基于概率程序语义学，在解码时引入语义防护格，采用约束语义学将预言机过滤转化为程序逻辑判断，使用多智能体操作演算和已验证的Lean构件来认证实现行为。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究表明，该方法在不牺牲吞吐量的情况下有效减少幻觉，为大规模经验模型与形式验证之间提供了实用桥梁。

Conclusion: TAD通过解码时的语义防护机制成功减少了语言模型的事实错误，实现了经验模型与形式验证的有效结合，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)的普及使关键网络物理系统面临传统防御无法应对的复杂多阶段攻击，需要具备上下文感知能力的自适应安全解决方案。

Method: 融合LLM和MARL两种AI范式：使用LLM作为语义桥梁将非结构化遥测数据转换为上下文状态表示，然后采用MAPPO多智能体强化学习算法学习协作安全策略。

Result: 在SWaT基准数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK ICS框架的合成数据集上，L2M-AID达到97.2%检测率，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，并显著改善了物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为保护关键国家基础设施提供了一个强大的新范式，通过语义感知和协作智能实现了自适应、弹性的工业安全防御。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思考模型性能提升的本质原因：是学习全新推理能力，还是重新利用基础模型已有的能力。

Method: 提出混合模型，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督、自下而上的方法发现可解释的推理行为；在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上测试三个基础模型和四个思考模型。

Result: 混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复高达91%到思考模型的性能差距，仅需引导12%的token；提供了因果测试方法来验证基础模型中推理机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 思考模型的训练本质：预训练阶段获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段学习在正确时机高效部署这些机制，从而优化推理计算效率。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作通过功利主义代理基准来评估LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的政策遵从无人机，无法实现真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。

Method: 提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉静默的。通过经验分析和理论证明，隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同。

Result: 推导出了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，建立了双层的发射机制，其中包含认知内容。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前驱，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在容量限制，需要更个性化和连续的护理方法。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁的低水平体验采样，促进诊断协调，并引入心理健康数字孪生(MHDTs)作为连续更新的计算模型框架。

Result: AI能够有效进行患者体验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，为个性化心理健康护理提供数据支持。

Conclusion: 连续、丰富和以患者为中心的数据采样能够动态适应个体需求，改善心理健康护理的可及性和治疗效果，MHDTs框架具有变革潜力。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

Motivation: 现有AI智能体大多局限于静态规划和脆弱的交互，缺乏真正的协作或自适应推理能力。

Method: 采用分层架构，管理智能体协调领域专家智能体，分解任务，并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈自适应重新规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

### [230] [Evaluation of LLMs for Process Model Analysis and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07489)
*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，未经训练的LLM（如ChatGPT o3）能够有效理解BPMN流程模型图像，在语法、逻辑和语义层面智能回答相关问题，不同LLM在准确性和有效性上表现各异，但都能作为业务流程设计者的有价值助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在交互式对话中理解流程模型、发现语法和逻辑错误，并通过自然语言界面进行深度推理的能力。

Method: 使用多个LLM进行实证分析，包括ChatGPT o3等模型，在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解和推理能力。

Result: 未经训练的LLM能够有效理解BPMN流程模型，在语法、逻辑和语义层面提供智能回答，不同LLM性能存在差异，但都表现出作为流程设计助手的价值。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手，表现出类似人类的推理特性，能够进行深度流程分析和优化。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TESTAM+是一个增强的时空交通预测框架，通过引入结合物理道路拓扑和数据驱动特征相似性的SpatioSemantic专家，显著提升了预测性能，同时发现战略性的专家选择比复杂的多专家集成更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通预测模型如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力，需要开发能够结合物理拓扑和数据特征的增强框架。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入新颖的SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合，并进行战略性专家选择。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%(3.10 vs 3.14)，在PEMS BAY上提升4.1%(1.65 vs 1.72)；最优配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%(2.99 vs 3.38)，推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+减少53.1%。

Conclusion: 战略性设计的少量专家优于复杂的多专家集成，在实现最先进性能的同时提供卓越的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在推理和问题解决方面表现出色，但在时间序列推理任务中仍存在幻觉和知识泄露问题，需要专门的方法来处理原始数值序列。

Method: 使用原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，记录证据日志，通过自批判和质量门控迭代优化推理过程，将统计和结构信息提取委托给时间序列分析工具。

Result: 在理解基准测试中达到与最先进LLMs相当的性能，在推理任务中显著改进，特别是在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过分离LLMs的推理优势与时间序列分析的专业能力，有效缓解了知识泄露和幻觉问题，为时间序列推理提供了可解释且可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个可复现的仿真框架来评估多模态环境中生成代理的安全性、连贯性和信任度，发现当前代理在检测直接多模态矛盾方面表现良好，但在全局安全对齐方面存在显著局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使代理能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但它们在跨模态安全性、连贯性和信任推理方面的能力仍然有限，需要系统评估框架。

Method: 引入可复现仿真框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知能力，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 实验显示代理仅能实现55%的不安全计划修正成功率，在误导性视觉信息下45%的不安全行为被接受，不同模型的不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全方面存在关键局限性，该框架为研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在政府服务中存在偏见和错误输出，减少了公民和公务员的决策参与权。现有透明度方法过于技术化，难以被公众理解，无法提供决策的广泛社会背景洞察。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，开发了公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 提出了一个框架，使透明度不仅限于技术对象，而是能够连接理解与行动可能性，让公众真正参与AI决策过程。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度是解决AI系统在公共服务中偏见和公民参与度不足问题的关键，需要超越纯技术视角，融入社会技术系统考量。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Motivation: 医疗智能系统被欧盟AI法案归类为高风险系统，需要正式的风险管理流程来确保符合可信AI的伦理要求，因此需要优化风险降低策略。

Method: 将风险降低问题形式化为约束优化任务，研究混合整数规划(MIP)、可满足性(SAT)和约束规划(CP)三种求解范式，使用Minizinc约束建模语言进行建模。

Result: 通过实验研究比较了三种方法的性能、表达能力和可扩展性，识别了方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 从方法论的限制出发，提出了将Minizinc模型整合到完整可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的未来工作展望。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于从历史轨迹数据中发现热门路径，无需模型训练即可处理地理空间查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法在热门路径查询中需要模型训练、参数调优和重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出的能力为地理空间问题提供了新的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段多智能体框架：SEARCH阶段识别热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时生成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出更高的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，且成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了无需训练的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Conclusion: 早期经验作为模仿学习和完全经验驱动智能体之间的实用桥梁，为语言智能体的自我学习和改进提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级的澄清模块，通过插入最小必要的问题来阻止多智能体系统中边缘级错误的传播，显著提高准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过协作分工有望增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（一个消息传递中的小错误在整个链中传播）而经常表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i)从策划的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略；(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问；(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提高公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的系统分类和链接局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 论文研究了可追踪和可问责的LLM多代理系统，通过Planner→Executor→Critic流水线结构，分析错误传播路径并量化代理角色特性，显著提升系统可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的顺序多代理系统缺乏透明度，错误会悄无声息地在阶段间传递，难以追踪和问责，需要建立可追踪的问责机制。

Method: 构建Planner→Executor→Critic流水线，评估8种配置的3种先进LLM在3个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播路径和修复方法。

Result: 结构化问责交接显著提高准确性；模型具有明确的角色特定优势和风险；准确率-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构流水线通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的数据驱动方法，用于设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测且可问责的多代理系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 本文主张将生成式AI应用于心理健康服务培训，而非直接用于治疗聊天机器人，认为这是更低风险、高影响力的应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对AI在心理健康领域的投资和讨论过度集中于治疗聊天机器人，但作者认为生成式AI在培训心理健康服务提供者方面具有更大潜力且风险更低。

Method: 通过理论分析和实际案例研究，展示生成式AI如何改善心理健康服务培训，特别是退伍军人互相支持的心理健康培训项目。

Result: 生成式AI成功提升了退伍军人心理健康支持的培训效果，证明了其在心理健康服务培训中的可行性和价值。

Conclusion: 应该优先投资于利用生成式AI来支持心理健康服务提供者的培训，这比直接用于治疗聊天机器人更安全且影响更深远。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

*Yinglun Zhu,Jiancheng Zhang,Fuzhi Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文发现现有评估指标系统性低估了AI模型的组合推理能力，提出了组匹配分数和测试时匹配算法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理基准测试中表现不佳，但作者认为这是由于评估指标的系统性低估造成的。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法，这是一种无需外部监督的自改进方法。

Result: 方法显著提升了模型性能，使SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超过估计的人类表现。

Conclusion: TTM算法能持续提升模型性能，推动组合推理的前沿发展，在16个数据集变体上均表现一致有效。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在推荐系统中安全探索新物品的框架，通过安全离策略策略梯度和部署高效策略学习来保证安全性的同时探索新动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中新物品频繁添加，现有离策略学习方法在新动作存在时可能不安全，需要在保证安全的前提下探索新动作。

Method: 开发了Safe OPG（基于高置信度离策略评估的模型无关安全OPL方法）和DEPL-SUE框架（利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化）。

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL-SUE框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实现的同时探索新动作。

Conclusion: 提出的框架解决了安全性和探索新动作之间的权衡问题，实现了推荐系统的安全部署和有效探索。

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于STL在线因果监测的奖励生成方法，通过实时监测系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，生成反映瞬时状态动态的奖励，解决了传统STL奖励函数稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STL引导的强化学习方法使用全局评估的奖励函数，但稀疏的全局奖励可能导致训练不收敛和不稳定，需要更精确的局部奖励累积机制。

Method: 采用在线因果监测方法，在每个控制步骤持续监测系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，计算满足或违反的量化距离，并提供了因果语义的平滑近似以支持深度强化学习。

Result: 在Gym环境中的连续控制基准测试表明，该方法优于现有的STL引导RL方法，提供了更鲁棒和高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 基于在线因果语义的STL引导RL方法能够有效解决奖励稀疏性问题，提升深度强化学习的训练性能和稳定性。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了oMeBench基准测试和oMeS评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在有机反应机理推理方面的能力，发现当前模型在多步推理方面存在困难，但通过提示策略和微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚它们是否真正具备化学推理能力，即生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径的能力。

Method: 引入oMeBench（首个大规模专家策划的有机机理推理基准）和oMeS（结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性的动态评估框架），分析最先进大语言模型的性能。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难。通过提示策略和在所提数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench将为推动AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供严格基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合分层引用图来生成更结构化和全面的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM自动生成综述的方法通常直接总结大量相关论文，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合分层引用图（基础层、发展层、前沿层），结合层内横向搜索和跨层纵向遍历，生成多级摘要并整合为结构化综述大纲，最后通过多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明SurveyG在人类专家和LLM作为评判者的评估中均优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且更好地符合领域知识分类体系。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM自动生成综述的质量，为自动化文献综述提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMIA是一个基于LLM的医学智能代理架构，通过形式化可验证的推理过程确保可靠性，在医疗管理任务中实现超过98%的错误检测率，并能显著降低处理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在医学领域有应用前景，但存在事实和逻辑错误的问题，这在高风险医疗领域是不可接受的。需要开发可靠的AI系统来确保医疗应用的准确性和可信度。

Method: MMIA递归地将复杂医疗任务分解为基于证据的原子步骤，通过自动审计推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性来确保可靠性。采用"引导"模式将已验证的推理链存储为"定理"，后续任务可使用检索增强生成(RAG)高效解决。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域的验证中，MMIA实现了超过98%的错误检测率，假阳性率低于1%，显著优于基线LLM。RAG匹配模式预计可将平均处理成本降低约85%。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要一步，使LLM技术在医学关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

TL;DR: 提出GRAIL框架，将测试时图域自适应重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，利用LLM将目标图恢复到源域状态，无需访问源域数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域自适应方法依赖源域数据，但源域数据常因隐私安全问题不可用。测试时图域自适应(TT-GDA)旨在不访问源域示例的情况下实现知识迁移。

Method: 1. 压缩节点表示为紧凑潜在特征，使用图扩散过程建模图恢复过程；2. 量化模块将恢复特征编码为离散标记；3. 微调LLM作为生成式恢复器；4. 引入强化学习过程，使用对齐和置信度奖励指导恢复质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GRAIL框架成功将TT-GDA重构为生成式图恢复问题，利用LLM的生成能力在无需源域数据的情况下实现有效的域自适应。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题，现有分解方法依赖启发式、代理或手动分解，缺乏系统性

Method: ACONIC框架将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式化复杂度度量指导任务分解

Result: 在组合任务(SATBench)和LLM数据库查询任务(Spider)上，基于复杂度度量的分解使代理性能提升10-40个百分点

Conclusion: ACONIC框架通过系统化分解方法有效解决了LLM在复杂任务上的可靠性问题

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型的响应上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对的样本中学习知识。

Method: 引入外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确的正确更新方向学习。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法能够充分利用每个样本，提高训练效率，并让模型在训练过程中学习参考答案的解题策略，从而增强推理泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 研究对抗环境中智能体面临的关键战略权衡：获取信息增强态势感知的同时可能暴露自身位置，增加被攻击风险。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈框架，采用SHADOW多头部序贯强化学习框架，集成连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追捕者相比六个竞争基线实现更高成功率，时序建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力，证明了框架的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理，引入协同推理优化机制，采用双奖励结构训练代理。

Result: 在四个真实世界道路网络上的实验表明，CityNav在旅行效率和拥堵缓解方面优于九种经典路径搜索和基于RL的基准方法。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协作的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with

*Zhiqing Cui,Binwu Wang,Qingxiang Liu,Yeqiang Wang,Zhengyang Zhou,Yuxuan Liang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Augur是一个完全基于LLM的时间序列预测框架，利用LLM的因果推理能力发现变量间的有向因果关联，通过师生架构实现准确且可解释的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时间序列预测方法存在架构边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示、缺乏可解释性等局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果检验推断有向因果图；学生代理细化图结构，在高置信度因果关联上微调，并将这些关联编码为丰富文本提示进行预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上与25个基线方法对比，Augur实现了竞争性性能和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架不仅提高了预测准确性，还提供了透明、可追溯的变量交互推理过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: 该框架为评估DeepResearch系统提供了标准化方法，建立了系统能力比较的基础，推动了AI研究助手的发展。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

TL;DR: 论文揭示了LLM金融代理存在"利润幻象"问题，即回测收益因LLM信息泄露而在知识窗口结束后消失，提出了FactFin框架通过反事实扰动来学习因果驱动因素而非记忆结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM金融代理系统存在信息泄露问题，导致回测收益在模型知识窗口结束后消失，需要构建泄漏鲁棒的评估基准和解决方案。

Method: 提出FactFin框架，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件，通过反事实扰动强制LLM学习因果驱动因素。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在样本外泛化方面超越所有基线，提供卓越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效缓解了LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和实际交易表现。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

TL;DR: 提出一个集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架，用于实现个性化长期交互的LLM智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体在提供个性化交互方面存在局限，RAG虽然增强了上下文感知但缺乏结合上下文信息与用户特定数据的机制，现有个性化研究多为概念性而缺乏技术实现。

Method: 基于统一的个性化定义，结合多智能体协作和多源检索等已建立的AI模式，构建集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估，指标包括检索准确率、响应正确性和BertScore，并通过5天试点用户研究获得关于感知个性化的初步用户反馈。

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供早期指导，突显了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升LLM智能体适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式存在泛化性差、缺乏细粒度监督和稀疏反馈等问题，限制了LLM在电商搜索相关性分析中的表现。

Method: 采用Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO)算法，结合生成式步进奖励模型和人工标注验证器，并加入多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习。

Result: 在真实搜索基准测试中，TaoSR-SHE在推理质量和相关性预测准确性方面均优于SFT、DPO、GRPO等基线方法。

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE框架能够有效提升电商搜索相关性分析的性能，同时增强可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench基准系统地评估了语音语言模型在真实语音代理场景中的能力，发现了现有模型在多语言文化理解和对抗鲁棒性方面的不足。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多代理框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作来解决移动GUI代理在模糊、动态变化和冲突任务场景中的信息困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过于强调自主操作，忽视了任务执行过程中的用户参与需求，导致在信息困境场景中无法适应真实用户需求和偏好。

Method: ReInAgent集成三个专门代理：信息管理代理负责基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互，决策代理负责冲突感知规划，反思代理负责任务反思和信息一致性验证。

Result: 实验结果显示ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境，产生更符合用户偏好的结果，在涉及信息困境的复杂任务中比Mobile-Agent-v2成功率提高25%。

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的用户-代理协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，实现了在复杂现实场景中更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否真正连续地表示数值，以及它们在处理数值时的内在机制。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini、Voyage AI）的语言模型嵌入空间特性。

Result: 虽然重建精度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分只能解释嵌入空间变化的很小部分，表明许多嵌入组件与数值输入空间正交。随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型在表示数值时存在根本性限制，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，在思维阶段惩罚过高的熵值以鼓励简洁推理，在最终答案阶段允许适度的探索性，从而自适应控制响应长度。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力准确性，并展现出强大的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制PEAR能够有效平衡推理的简洁性和性能，为大推理模型的长度控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: AILoRA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然广泛使用，但仍面临性能次优和收敛慢的问题。研究发现W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务敏感，W^V特征表示稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：为W^Q注入主成分以保持任务适应能力，为W^V注入次要成分以保留通用特征表示。

Result: 该方法使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色，提升了微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过考虑注意力参数的功能差异，有效解决了LoRA的局限性，实现了更好的参数效率与性能平衡。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来优化生成精度，通过自然语言与闭环交互模拟的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的不同关键性场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述：3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其优化模块有效降低初始输出的过度攻击性，使碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim能够创建高保真场景，增强安全测试和训练，通过自然语言与闭环交互模拟的桥梁，有效生成符合用户意图的自动驾驶测试场景。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

Conclusion: MCCS方法能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，解决了现有方法在多条件场景下的局限性。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

### [271] [From Ethical Declarations to Provable Independence: An Ontology-Driven Optimal-Transport Framework for Certifiably Fair AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08086)
*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统移除所有敏感信息及其代理变量来克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性，无法完全消除敏感信息及其代理变量对AI决策的影响，需要一种数学上可证明的公平性保证方法。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理变量，构建捕获偏见模式的sigma代数G，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。

Result: 该方法能够保证真正的独立性而非仅仅去相关，在贷款审批等任务中确保完全公平性，其中ZIP代码等代理变量可能揭示种族信息。

Conclusion: 这是一个可证明且数学基础扎实的方法，为可信AI提供了完整的公平性保证。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 研究语言模型风险厌恶可操纵性，发现虽然某些模型与人类行为有一定对齐，但仍存在显著差异，需要改进生物中心测量方法以更好对齐人类与AI风险偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地集成到AI驱动的决策支持系统中，理解其风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止无意中将用户推向危险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究语言模型的风险厌恶可操纵性，考察其在多样化经济场景中复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险厌恶的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型显示出与人类行为的一定对齐，但存在显著差异，突显了需要改进生物中心可操纵性测量方法。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在模型设计方面进一步改进，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高其在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索与响应生成，在保持对话质量的同时大幅降低延迟（95.3%延迟减少）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话系统中延迟与质量的根本矛盾：轻量级模型延迟低但推理深度不足，工具增强的ReAct代理虽能提升事实性但同步执行导致检索过程中交互阻塞。

Method: 采用三组件架构：知识充足性评估器（实时评估）、轻量级响应生成器（即时交互）、异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制实现异步知识编排。

Result: 在TopiOCQA评估中，PMFR实现95.3%延迟降低（23.38s→1.09s），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过时间解耦框架从根本上解决了延迟与质量的矛盾，实现了连续对话流与渐进知识增强的平衡。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了R-HORIZON方法和基准，用于评估和增强大型推理模型的长视野推理能力，发现现有模型在复杂多步推理任务上表现不佳，通过强化学习训练可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长视野场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步推理任务的长视野推理基准，并使用带验证奖励的强化学习进行训练。

Result: 评估发现最先进的推理模型在长视野任务上性能显著下降，存在有限有效推理长度和思考预算分配问题。使用R-HORIZON数据训练的RLVR模型不仅提升多视野推理性能，还在标准推理任务上提高7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估LRMs的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AI多元主义指数(AIPI)，这是一个评估AI系统多元治理的透明、基于证据的测量工具，涵盖参与式治理、包容性与多样性、透明度和问责制四个支柱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统日益介入知识、沟通和决策，但开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家，可能导致技术编码狭隘利益并限制公众参与。现有基准主要关注语言、视觉和编码能力，缺乏对多元治理的公开可审计衡量。

Method: 开发了AIPI测量模型，通过可复现的流程整合结构化网络和仓库分析、外部评估及专家访谈，从公共工件和独立评估中编码可验证实践，明确处理"未知"证据。

Result: 建立了包含协议、代码本、评分脚本和证据图的开放维护系统，报告了试点提供商结果，并通过评分者一致性、覆盖报告、跨指标相关性和敏感性分析评估可靠性。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励向多元实践发展，为政策制定者、采购方和公众提供可比较的证据，相对于邻近的透明度、安全和治理框架定位该指数。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了锦标赛树方法(TTM)，一种新的偏好获取和评估框架，仅需m-1次成对比较即可获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，克服了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对比较方法需要完成m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负荷高，存在不一致风险，且计算复杂度高。需要一种更高效、一致的方法来建模专家判断。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用目标化减少比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。该方法确保设计一致性，最小化认知努力。

Result: TTM将偏好建模的维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数，确保一致性，与经典卡片法兼容，可处理区间和比率尺度，并开发了基于Web的工具展示实际应用性。

Conclusion: 锦标赛树方法提供了一种高效、一致的替代方案，显著减少了认知负荷和计算复杂度，同时保持了与传统方法的兼容性。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，引入因果意识可提升性能。智能体需要从隐藏的因果图中学习环境机制。

Method: 智能体通过重复干预与环境交互，使用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性，推断隐藏的因果DAG结构。

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下都优于观测方法，常能以零误差重建因果图结构，在最挑战配置中F1分数比最佳基线高0.25分。

Conclusion: DODO证明了通过干预学习因果结构的有效性，为AI因果意识提供了可行方法。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

TL;DR: 该论文从因果视角重新审视推理任务，将其建模为选择机制，并提出SR²框架来学习潜在变量之间的密集依赖关系，显著提升了推理准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管人类能轻松解决推理任务，但现有的大语言模型即使在大量预训练和后训练后仍无法可靠地进行推理。作者希望从因果角度理解推理任务在潜在空间中的行为，并为解决其挑战提供见解。

Method: 提出SR²框架，包含三个关键模块：反思表示学习、依赖自精炼和周期性中间对齐。该框架将估计的潜在变量作为反馈纳入选择机制，促进潜在表示之间密集依赖关系的学习。

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性方面带来显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，使用8倍更少的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并通过SR²框架学习潜在变量间的密集依赖关系，能够有效提升模型的推理能力，为复杂推理任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发严重担忧，需要揭示这些智能体的安全漏洞。

Method: CoTri后门攻击使用有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操控使智能体偏离预定任务。

Result: CoTri达到接近完美的攻击成功率，误触发率接近零，且由于训练数据建模环境随机性，意外提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了对智能体的稳定多步控制，同时增强了其内在鲁棒性和任务能力，使攻击更加隐蔽并带来潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了大型语言模型在数学推理任务中的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案。通过实验表明，训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次答案正确率而非修正能力。为此提出了基于问题感知的早期停止方法，显著减少推理token数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理能力上的显著提升通常归因于生成长思维链和反思推理的能力，但反思对性能改善的具体贡献尚不明确。本文旨在系统分析反思行为在模型推理中的作用。

Method: 在五个数学数据集上系统分析了八个推理模型的推理过程，重点关注模型已生成答案后继续反思的行为。构建了不同反思步骤数量的监督微调数据集进行训练分析，并提出问题感知的早期停止方法来动态截断反思过程。

Result: 分析发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变模型的初始答案。训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次答案正确率而非修正能力。提出的动态截断方法在五个数学数据集上减少24.5%的推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思在推理过程中主要起确认作用而非修正作用，通过动态截断不必要的反思步骤可以显著提高推理效率，同时保持较高的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Cover@tau指标替代Pass@k来评估LLM的推理能力，认为在离散答案空间中，Pass@k在大k值时反映的是随机猜测而非真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Pass@k指标在大采样预算下可能误导对模型推理边界的评估，因为离散答案空间中高k值更多反映随机猜测的成功率而非真实推理能力。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，该指标能更好地区分真实推理和随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估多个RLVR模型发现，相比Pass@1，模型相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更准确地评估模型的真实推理能力，特别是在离散答案空间任务中，避免了Pass@k在大k值时的误导性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

TL;DR: 提出语义相似度评分(SSR)方法，使用LLMs生成文本响应并通过嵌入相似度映射到Likert分布，解决了传统消费者研究中的面板偏见和规模限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究存在面板偏见和规模限制，而直接使用LLMs获取数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法：从LLMs获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考陈述的Likert分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查数据集上测试，SSR达到人类重测信度的90%，保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)，并提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留了传统调查指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了QAgent，一个统一的代理式检索增强生成框架，通过搜索代理进行自适应检索，优化查询理解并通过交互式推理和检索提升检索质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RAG在复杂查询理解方面的不足，以及基于强化学习的搜索代理在泛化和部署方面的挑战。

Method: 采用模块化搜索代理进行查询理解，通过多步决策过程使用强化学习训练，最大化检索质量并支持准确的下游答案。

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务上表现优异，可作为即插即用模块用于实际部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过专注于有效检索的策略增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 检测大型语言模型中的幻觉对其可信部署至关重要，现有基于不确定性的检测框架存在局限性。

Method: 通过测量从多个模型输出和不同层导出的隐藏状态的有效秩来量化不确定性，基于表示的光谱分析。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉并在各种场景中稳健泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM真实性检测提供了新的范式，结合了理论优雅性和实际效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

<details>

Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息

Method: 使用动态门控进行语言和视觉线索的自适应融合，特征调制和通道注意力最大化有限视觉信息的效用，辅助对比目标进行视觉接地

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优于或与多模态基线相当，动态门控发现可解释模式，对内容词偏好视觉线索，对功能词偏好语言线索

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中，LLM缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，现有方法无法有效利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享，限制了自我演进能力和搜索空间多样性。

Method: 结合领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，使用蒙特卡洛图搜索(MCGS)实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，支持自我演进和协作学习。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算（标准运行时间的一半）下，在平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过集成领域知识库和MCGS，显著提升了LLM在机器学习工程任务中的性能，证明了该方法在复杂搜索空间中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: CaRT方法通过反事实轨迹对和推理训练，教导LLM在信息收集过程中适时终止，提高任务效率和成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中战略性地收集信息，但现有模型缺乏知道何时停止收集信息并做出决策的能力，容易导致过度思考或偏离方向

Method: CaRT通过反事实轨迹对（一个适合终止的轨迹和其最小修改的不适合终止版本）来微调LLM，训练模型通过语言推理解释终止决策的合理性

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法有效解决了LLM在战略信息收集中的终止时机问题，通过反事实推理训练提升了模型的决策效率

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型在顺序微调过程中出现的灾难性遗忘问题，即在学习新技能时保持原有能力的稳定性。

Method: 在五个目标技能上进行顺序微调，同时在八个基准测试上监控通用能力，通过分析输出标记分布变化来识别遗忘机制，并提出了两种参数更新策略：仅更新自注意力投影层，或仅更新MLP的Gate&Up层而冻结Down投影。

Result: 发现遗忘现象在后续阶段可以部分恢复，识别了输出标记分布的可测量偏移，提出的两种参数更新策略在多个模型和任务上都能实现强目标增益，同时大幅保持原有性能。

Conclusion: 通过选择性参数更新策略可以有效缓解大型多模态模型的灾难性遗忘问题，实现新技能学习与原有能力保持的良好平衡。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成的方法在图结构推理中存在局限性，检索质量限制生成效果，且现有检索器对未见图泛化能力差

Method: RoE将图推理建模为探索过程，LLM逐步选择节点和边构建推理路径并生成答案，采用监督微调+强化学习的两阶段训练

Result: 在基准数据集上相比基线方法取得显著整体改进，对未见图具有有效泛化能力

Conclusion: RoE通过统一的探索框架解决了图结构推理中的检索-生成分离问题，实现了更好的推理效果和泛化性能

Abstract: Reasoning over structured graphs remains a fundamental challenge for Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly when scaling to large graphs. Existing
approaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm:
first retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers
conditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often
struggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation
process is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the
retrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed
recently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training
graphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical
applicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel
approach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs
as a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate
nodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and
generating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is
trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness
and generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE
achieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also
generalizing effectively to unseen graphs.

Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖点击、点赞等短期参与度信号，但这些信号嘈杂、稀疏且无法捕捉长期用户满意度和留存。需要一种能直接衡量用户长期意图的指标。

Method: 开发了基于调查的Retentive Relevance指标，通过心理测量方法验证其有效性，构建生产就绪的代理模型，并将其集成到多阶段排序系统的最终阶段。

Result: Retentive Relevance在预测次日留存方面显著优于参与度信号和其他调查指标，尤其对历史参与度有限的用户效果更好。大规模A/B实验显示能显著提升参与度和留存，同时减少低质量内容的曝光。

Conclusion: 提供了首个经验验证的框架，将内容级用户感知与生产系统中的留存结果联系起来，为负责任AI发展提供了可扩展、以用户为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement
signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these
signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user
satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel
content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'
intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey
measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets
forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions
and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive
Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,
discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we
show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals
and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for
users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy
model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage
ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based
on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,
while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale
A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework
linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production
systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both
platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for
responsible AI development.

Conclusion: ISMIE框架为开发新的IS和IR模型奠定了基础，有助于推进对现代信息环境中人机交互和系统设计的理解。

Abstract: The modern information environment (MIE) is increasingly complex, shaped by a
wide range of techniques designed to satisfy users' information needs.
Information seeking (IS) models are effective mechanisms for characterizing
user-system interactions. However, conceptualizing a model that fully captures
the MIE landscape poses a challenge. We argue: Does such a model exist? To
address this, we propose the Information Seeking in Modern Information
Environments (ISMIE) framework as a fundamental step. ISMIE conceptualizes the
information seeking process (ISP) via three key concepts: Components (e.g.,
Information Seeker), Intervening Variables (e.g., Interactive Variables), and
Activities (e.g., Acquiring). Using ISMIE's concepts and employing a case study
based on a common scenario - misinformation dissemination - we analyze six
existing IS and information retrieval (IR) models to illustrate their
limitations and the necessity of ISMIE. We then show how ISMIE serves as an
actionable framework for both characterization and experimental design. We
characterize three pressing issues and then outline two research blueprints: a
user-centric, industry-driven experimental design for the authenticity and
trust crisis to AI-generated content and a system-oriented, academic-driven
design for tackling dopamine-driven content consumption. Our framework offers a
foundation for developing IS and IR models to advance knowledge on
understanding human interactions and system design in MIEs.

Motivation: 传统视频检索方法依赖文本查询与视频元数据的直接匹配，难以弥合文本描述与视频多面性内容之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 采用文本查询聚类机制捕捉更广泛的语义范围，使用Sweeper模块识别和减轻聚类中的噪声，引入VTC-Attention机制根据视频内容动态调整聚类内的注意力。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上的实验表明，所提出的模型超越了现有的最先进模型。

Conclusion: VTC框架通过文本聚类和动态注意力机制有效提升了视频检索性能，解决了传统方法中的语义鸿沟问题。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video content across various platforms has
highlighted the urgent need for advanced video retrieval systems. Traditional
methods, which primarily depend on directly matching textual queries with video
metadata, often fail to bridge the semantic gap between text descriptions and
the multifaceted nature of video content. This paper introduces a novel
framework, the Video-Text Cluster (VTC), which enhances video retrieval by
clustering text queries to capture a broader semantic scope. We propose a
unique clustering mechanism that groups related queries, enabling our system to
consider multiple interpretations and nuances of each query. This clustering is
further refined by our innovative Sweeper module, which identifies and
mitigates noise within these clusters. Additionally, we introduce the
Video-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts
focus within the clusters based on the video content, ensuring that the
retrieval process emphasizes the most relevant textual features. Further
experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models on five public datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by

facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this
challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel
dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses
diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in
existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that
embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an
interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on
accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's
effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval
parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion
techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual
property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new paradigm of modeling and computation
for information tasks. Recommendation systems are a critical application domain
poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and
world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce
PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale
recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs,
continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific
fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus
particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to
generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation
datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements
for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large
embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval
performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along
with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching
this framework to billions of users in YouTube.

Method: 探索使用LLM生成物品使用场景作为起点，通过人工标注评估生成场景的合理性

Result: 约85%的生成场景被判定为合理，表明LLM能够有效生成现实的物品使用场景

Conclusion: LLM生成的物品使用场景可以作为构建互补推荐系统的有效起点

Abstract: Complementary recommendations suggest combinations of useful items that play
important roles in e-commerce. However, complementary relationships are often
subjective and vary among individuals, making them difficult to infer from
historical data. Unlike conventional history-based methods that rely on
statistical co-occurrence, we focus on the underlying usage context that
motivates item combinations. We hypothesized that people select complementary
items by imagining specific usage scenarios and identifying the needs in such
situations. Based on this idea, we explored the use of large language models
(LLMs) to generate item usage scenarios as a starting point for constructing
complementary recommendation systems. First, we evaluated the plausibility of
LLM-generated scenarios through manual annotation. The results demonstrated
that approximately 85% of the generated scenarios were determined to be
plausible, suggesting that LLMs can effectively generate realistic item usage
scenarios.

*Jianhui Yang,Yiming Jin,Pengkun Jiao,Chenhe Dong,Zerui Huang,Shaowei Yao,Xiaojiang Zhou,Dan Ou,Haihong Tang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了TaoSR-AGRL框架，通过规则感知奖励塑造和自适应引导回放，解决了LLM在电商搜索相关性预测中推理能力不足和训练收敛慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在复杂业务规则和用户查询下缺乏对长尾和挑战性案例的鲁棒推理能力，而强化学习方法如GRPO存在稀疏终端奖励问题，无法有效指导多步推理。

Method: TaoSR-AGRL包含两个关键创新：1）规则感知奖励塑造，将最终相关性判断分解为与领域特定标准对齐的密集结构化奖励；2）自适应引导回放，识别训练中的低准确率轨迹并注入针对性真实指导。

Result: 在淘宝搜索的大规模真实数据集和在线A/B测试中，TaoSR-AGRL在离线实验中持续优于DPO和标准GRPO基线，提升了相关性准确性、规则遵循性和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: TaoSR-AGRL成功解决了LLM在电商搜索相关性预测中的关键挑战，已在淘宝主搜索场景部署，为数亿用户提供服务。

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

*Daniel Huwiler,Kurt Stockinger,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: VersionRAG是一个版本感知的RAG框架，通过分层图结构建模文档演化，在版本敏感问题上达到90%准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在处理版本化技术文档时失败，因为缺乏时间有效性检查，只能达到58-64%的准确率。

Method: 使用分层图结构捕获版本序列、内容边界和文档状态变化，基于意图分类进行查询路由，实现精确的版本感知过滤和变更跟踪。

Result: 在VersionQA基准测试中达到90%准确率，比朴素RAG(58%)和GraphRAG(64%)显著提升；在隐式变更检测上达到60%准确率，而基线方法几乎失败；索引时比GraphRAG节省97%的token。

Conclusion: 将版本化文档问答确立为独立任务，为未来研究提供了解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

TL;DR: ReasonEmbed是一个用于推理密集型文档检索的新型文本嵌入模型，通过ReMixer数据合成方法、Redapter自适应学习算法以及多骨干网络实现，在BRIGHT基准测试中取得了38.1的nDCG@10最高分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理密集型文档检索中现有文本嵌入模型的不足，特别是处理复杂语义关系和推理需求的能力。

Method: 1. ReMixer数据合成方法：克服先前合成数据集的平凡性问题，大规模生成82K高质量训练样本；2. Redapter自适应学习算法：根据推理强度动态调整训练样本权重；3. 在多个不同规模的骨干网络上实现ReasonEmbed。

Result: ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B模型在BRIGHT基准测试中取得了38.1的nDCG@10最高分，显著优于现有文本嵌入模型。

Conclusion: ReasonEmbed在推理密集型检索任务上表现出色，作者将开源所有资源以推动该领域研究发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ReasonEmbed, a novel text embedding model
developed for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our work includes three
key technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis
method that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic
datasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples.
Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which
significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully
open-source our created resources in ReasonEmbed to push forward the research
advancement in this field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的用户终身价值预测方法，通过目标分解和重构框架来解决LTV分布复杂性问题，在TapTap RTB广告系统中进行了部署和测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时竞价广告平台需要准确预测用户终身价值来优化广告分配效率和投资回报率，但现有方法对异常值敏感，预测效果有限。

Method: 基于移动游戏应用内购买特性，设计模型先预测特定价格下的交易次数，然后从这些中间预测计算总支付金额。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上进行了实验评估，并与最先进的ZILN模型进行了在线A/B测试。

Conclusion: 提出的目标分解重构框架能有效应对LTV分布挑战，为RTB广告系统提供了更准确的LTV预测解决方案。

Abstract: For Internet platforms operating real-time bidding (RTB) advertising service,
a comprehensive understanding of user lifetime value (LTV) plays a pivotal role
in optimizing advertisement allocation efficiency and maximizing the return on
investment (ROI) for advertisement sponsors, thereby facilitating growth of
commercialization revenue for the platform. However, the inherent complexity of
user LTV distributions induces significant challenges in accurate LTV
prediction. Existing state-of-the-art works, which primarily focus on directly
learning the LTV distributions through well-designed loss functions, achieve
limited success due to their vulnerability to outliers. In this paper, we
proposed a novel LTV prediction method to address distribution challenges
through an objective decomposition and reconstruction framework. Briefly
speaking, based on the in-app purchase characteristics of mobile gamers, our
model was designed to first predict the number of transactions at specific
prices and then calculate the total payment amount from these intermediate
predictions. Our proposed model was evaluated through experiments on real-world
industrial dataset, and deployed on the TapTap RTB advertising system for
online A/B testing along with the state-of-the-art ZILN model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解择优选拔程序（如大学录取）如何通过反馈循环影响群体公平性，特别是在群体间没有本质差异的情况下，分析差异的产生和持续机制。

Method: 研究引入了一个新颖的代际模型，分析完全对称群体间的选拔过程，通过理论分析和扩展模拟来验证结果。

Result: 结果显示：完全对称条件下差异最终消散但耗时很长；轻微不对称会导致差异持续存在；群体规模小会加剧随机差异；项目稀缺性和有效性影响差异持续时间。

Conclusion: 研究结论强调了在公平性干预设计中需要考虑选拔程序的反馈循环效应，特别是轻微不对称如何导致持久性差异，为算法公平性干预提供了重要启示。

Abstract: We study group fairness in the context of feedback loops induced by
meritocratic selection into programs that themselves confer additional
advantage, like college admissions. We introduce a novel stylized
inter-generational model for the setting and analyze it in situations where
there are no underlying differences between two populations. We show that, when
the benefit of the program (or the harm of not getting into it) is completely
symmetric, disparities between the two populations will eventually dissipate.
However, the time an accumulated advantage takes to dissipate could be
significant, and increases substantially as a function of the relative
importance of the program in conveying benefits. We also find that significant
disparities can arise due to chance even from completely symmetric initial
conditions, especially when populations are small. The introduction of even a
slight asymmetry, where the group that has accumulated an advantage becomes
slightly preferred, leads to a completely different outcome. In these
instances, starting from completely symmetric initial conditions, disparities
between groups arise stochastically and then persist over time, yielding a
permanent advantage for one group. Our analysis precisely characterizes
conditions under which disparities persist or diminish, with a particular focus
on the role of the scarcity of available spots in the program and its
effectiveness. We also present extensive simulations in a richer model that
further support our theoretical results in the simpler, stylized model. Our
findings are relevant for the design and implementation of algorithmic fairness
interventions in similar selection processes.

TL;DR: 该论文回顾了ICT与微型企业关系的文献，指出微型企业在数字环境中面临困难，建议未来研究应采用系统性方法而非个体分析，并关注动态创新过程的理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现代数字技术的快速发展，数字创新过程正在渗透到微型企业所在的行业、市场和社会环境中，但微型企业在这些数字环境中面临严重困难，有被抛在后面的风险。

Method: 论文回顾了关于ICT与微型企业的文献，重点关注ICT的采用、使用和影响。

Result: 结果表明，该领域进一步研究应避免将单个微型企业作为分析单位，而应采用系统性方法研究市场、价值链或微型企业密集型行业。

Conclusion: 需要能够考虑变化和创新过程动态性质的理论框架，这是该领域的关键重点领域。

Abstract: The relationship between microenterprises and information and communication
technologies (ICTs) has always been troublesome. Because of the rapid pace of
modern digital technologies, digital innovation processes are permeating the
industries, markets, and social contexts in which microenterprises exist today.
However, microenterprises have severe difficulties engaging or performing in
these digital contexts and are at risk of being left behind. This paper reviews
the literature on ICTs and microenterprises, focusing on the adoption, usage,
and impact of ICTs. The results indicate that further research in this field
should avoid focusing on individual microenterprises (or samples of independent
microenterprises) as the unit of analysis and should favour a systemic approach
in which markets, value chains, or microenterprise-intensive sectors are
studied. Additionally, theoretical frameworks capable of considering change and
the dynamic nature of innovation processes are highlighted as a critical focus
area for the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据中心（特别是与AI相关的）快速发展，消耗大量自然资源，需要了解计算轨迹如何导致超越地球边界。

Method: 在World3-03模型中添加新的AI相关变量（如数据中心发展），创建AI增强场景来模拟这些动态。

Result: 通过添加影响污染的AI相关变量，可以观察到预期的动态变化，证明World3-03模型适用于研究AI对地球边界的影响。

Conclusion: World3-03模型是研究资源密集型计算与环境影响关系的可行方法，为未来定量研究提供了机会。

Abstract: The influential Limits to Growth report introduced a system dynamics-based
model to demonstrate global dynamics of the world's population, industry,
natural resources, agriculture, and pollution between 1900-2100. In current
times, the rapidly expanding trajectory of data center development, much of it
linked to AI, uses increasing amounts of natural resources. The extraordinary
amount of resources claimed warrants the question of how computing trajectories
contribute to exceeding planetary boundaries. Based on the general robustness
of the World3-03 model and its influence in serving as a foundation for current
climate frameworks, we explore whether the model is a viable method to
quantitatively simulate the impact of data centers on limits to growth. Our
paper explores whether the World3-03 model is a feasible method for reflecting
on these dynamics by adding new variables to the model in order to simulate a
new AI-augmented scenario. We find that through our addition of AI-related
variables (such as increasing data center development) impacting pollution in
the World3-03 model, we can observe the expected changes to dynamics,
demonstrating the viability of the World3-03 model for examining AI's impact on
planetary boundaries. We detail future research opportunities for using the
World3-03 model to explore the relationships between increasing
resource-intensive computing and the resulting impacts to the environment in a
quantitative way given its feasibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究消费者对算法个性化定价和价格歧视的态度，了解为何人们不喜欢这些定价策略。

Method: 对荷兰代表性人口样本进行两次消费者调查（N=1233和N=1202），分析消费者对价格歧视和动态定价示例的态度。

Result: 绝大多数消费者认为在线价格歧视不公平、不可接受，并认为应该禁止。但一些公司使用了几十年的定价策略也几乎同样不受欢迎。

Conclusion: 消费者普遍反对各种形式的个性化定价和价格歧视，需要深入理解人们反对这些定价策略的原因。

Abstract: Online stores can present a different price to each customer. Such
algorithmic personalised pricing can lead to advanced forms of price
discrimination based on the characteristics and behaviour of individual
consumers. We conducted two consumer surveys among a representative sample of
the Dutch population (N=1233 and N=1202), to analyse consumer attitudes towards
a list of examples of price discrimination and dynamic pricing. A vast majority
finds online price discrimination unfair and unacceptable, and thinks it should
be banned. However, some pricing strategies that have been used by companies
for decades are almost equally unpopular. We analyse the results to better
understand why people dislike many types of price discrimination.

TL;DR: 本文论证了欧盟在GDPR之外制定专门的电子隐私法规以保护通信保密权的必要性和正当性，指出该权利保护隐私、言论自由和通信服务信任三大核心价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨欧盟是否需要制定专门的电子隐私法规来保护通信保密权，分析该权利的法律基础和核心价值，以回应"GDPR已足够"的观点。

Method: 通过追溯通信保密权的历史起源，分析其在《欧洲人权公约》和欧盟法律中的现有保护机制，识别该权利保护的三个核心价值。

Result: 通信保密权不仅保护个人隐私利益，还保护言论自由和通信服务信任等集体利益，这些利益对信息社会的正常运转至关重要。

Conclusion: 在GDPR之外制定专门的欧盟规则来保护通信保密权是合理且必要的，因为该权利保护的价值超出了个人数据保护的范畴。

Abstract: In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides
comprehensive rules for the processing of personal data. In addition, the EU
lawmaker intends to adopt specific rules to protect confidentiality of
communications, in a separate ePrivacy Regulation. Some have argued that there
is no need for such additional rules for communications confidentiality. This
Article discusses the protection of the right to confidentiality of
communications in Europe. We look at the right's origins to assess the
rationale for protecting it. We also analyze how the right is currently
protected under the European Convention on Human Rights and under EU law. We
show that at its core the right to communications confidentiality protects
three individual and collective values: privacy, freedom of expression, and
trust in communication services. The right aims to ensure that individuals and
organizations can safely entrust communication to service providers. Initially,
the right protected only postal letters, but it has gradually developed into a
strong safeguard for the protection of confidentiality of communications,
regardless of the technology used. Hence, the right does not merely serve
individual privacy interests, but also other more collective interests that are
crucial for the functioning of our information society. We conclude that
separate EU rules to protect communications confidentiality, next to the GDPR,
are justified and necessary.

Motivation: 学习分析旨在将教育数据转化为洞察、决策和行动，但提供的洞察、决策和行动往往对最终用户不透明，当干预、反馈和建议失败时，会导致信任和接受问题。

Method: 采用迭代式以人为中心的设计方法，设计并实现了Indicator Editor工具，支持自助式学习分析，让用户能够控制指标实现过程。通过定性用户研究(n=15)调查该方法对用户感知和交互的影响。

Result: 研究提供了定性证据，表明在指标实现过程中支持用户交互和提供用户控制，对学习分析的关键方面（透明度、信任、满意度和接受度）具有积极影响。

Conclusion: 通过探索实现透明学习分析的方法，特别是通过Indicator Editor工具支持用户控制指标实现过程，能够有效提高学习分析系统的透明度、信任度、满意度和接受度。

Abstract: The aim of learning analytics is to turn educational data into insights,
decisions, and actions to improve learning and teaching. The reasoning of the
provided insights, decisions, and actions is often not transparent to the
end-user, and this can lead to trust and acceptance issues when interventions,
feedback, and recommendations fail. In this paper, we shed light on achieving
transparent learning analytics by following a transparency through exploration
approach. To this end, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation
details of the Indicator Editor, which aims to support self-service learning
analytics by empowering end-users to take control of the indicator
implementation process. We systematically designed and implemented the
Indicator Editor through an iterative human-centered design (HCD) approach.
Further, we conducted a qualitative user study (n=15) to investigate the impact
of following a self-service learning analytics approach on the users'
perception of and interaction with the Indicator Editor. Our study showed
qualitative evidence that supporting user interaction and providing user
control in the indicator implementation process can have positive effects on
different crucial aspects of learning analytics, namely transparency, trust,
satisfaction, and acceptance.
