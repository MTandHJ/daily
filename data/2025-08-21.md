### [1] [A comparative study of some wavelet and sampling operators on various features of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14043)
*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究分析了多种正采样Kantorovich算子（SK算子）及其收敛性质，包括SK、高斯、双边和阈值小波算子，通过数学参数和数值实验验证了基本逼近定理，发现不同算子在图像处理中各有优劣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多种采样Kantorovich算子的逼近性能，分析它们在图像处理中的局部和全局近似特性，验证基本逼近定理在不同算子下的适用性。

Method: 引入基本术语和基本逼近定理，测量误差并研究MSE、SI、SSI、SMPI、ENL等数学参数，通过数值示例在理想条件下验证算子性能，使用2D Shepp-Logan Phantom图像分析感兴趣区域。

Result: 不同算子因其特性在处理图像不同特征时表现各异，某些算子对特定图像特征效果良好，而其他算子则表现不佳，验证了基本逼近定理的正确性。

Conclusion: 各种采样Kantorovich算子在图像处理中各有其重要性，由于图像的非理想特性，需要根据具体图像特征选择合适的算子，基本逼近定理得到了数值实验的验证。

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

### [2] [Federated Action Recognition for Smart Worker Assistance Using FastPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14113)
*Vinit Hegiste,Vidit Goyal,Tatjana Legler,Martin Ruskowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于联邦学习的姿态识别框架，在工业手势识别任务中显著提升跨用户泛化能力，相比集中式训练准确率提升12.4-58.3个百分点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能制造环境中需要实时准确识别工人动作，但传统集中式方法在隐私敏感的工业场景中不实用，需要隐私保护的解决方案

Method: 使用自定义工业手势数据集，采用改进的FastPose模型，比较LSTM和Transformer两种时序骨干网络，在四种训练范式（集中式、本地、FedAvg联邦平均、FedEnsemble联邦集成）下进行评估

Result: 联邦学习Transformer在全局测试集上比集中式训练提升12.4个百分点，FedEnsemble提升16.3个百分点；在未见外部客户端上，联邦学习和FedEnsemble分别比集中式准确率提升52.6和58.3个百分点

Conclusion: 联邦学习不仅能保护隐私，还能显著增强跨用户泛化能力，是异构工业环境中可扩展、隐私感知的人体活动识别的实用解决方案

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

### [3] [LENS: Learning to Segment Anything with Unified Reinforced Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14153)
*Lianghui Zhu,Bin Ouyang,Yuxuan Zhang,Tianheng Cheng,Rui Hu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Xiaoxin Chen,Li Yu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LENS是一个基于强化学习的端到端框架，通过联合优化推理过程和分割任务，在文本提示图像分割中实现了81.2%的平均cIoU，比现有方法提升5.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督微调方法在测试时忽略了显式的思维链推理，限制了模型对未见提示和领域的泛化能力。

Method: 提出LENS强化学习框架，使用统一的强化学习奖励（句子级、框级和分割级线索），端到端联合优化推理过程和分割质量。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg基准测试中达到81.2%的平均cIoU，比GLaMM方法提升高达5.6%。

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的思维链推理为文本提示分割提供了强大的先验，是实现更通用分割模型的有效路径。

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at
https://github.com/hustvl/LENS.

Conclusion: RynnEC为具身智能体提供了以区域为中心的视频范式，将推动通用认知核心的发展并促进跨具身任务的泛化

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing
fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise
interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an
egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for
evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will
advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents
and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model
checkpoints, and benchmark are available at:

### [5] [Local Scale Equivariance with Latent Deep Equilibrium Canonicalizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14187)
*Md Ashiqur Rahman,Chiao-An Yang,Michael N. Cheng,Lim Jun Hao,Jeremiah Jiang,Teck-Yian Lim,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出深度均衡规范化器(DEC)来解决计算机视觉中的尺度变化问题，通过提高模型的局部尺度等变性来改善性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉中物体尺度变化是基本挑战，同类物体可能有不同大小，且感知大小受相机距离影响，这些变化是局部的，需要有效处理尺度变化的方法

Method: 提出深度均衡规范化器(DEC)，可以轻松集成到现有网络架构中，并能适配预训练模型，提高模型的局部尺度等变性

Result: 在竞争性的ImageNet基准测试中，DEC提高了四种流行预训练深度网络(ViT、DeiT、Swin、BEiT)的模型性能和局部尺度一致性

Conclusion: DEC是处理尺度变化的有效方法，能够显著提升现有模型的性能和尺度一致性表现

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPSym利用CLIP视觉语言模型的预训练能力，通过语义感知提示分组和旋转等变解码器来检测旋转和反射对称性，在多个标准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性是计算机视觉中最基本的几何线索之一，但检测对称性一直是个挑战。研究探索预训练的CLIP模型是否能利用自然图像描述中的对称线索来辅助对称检测。

Method: 提出CLIPSym方法，结合CLIP的图像和语言编码器，以及基于Transformer和G-卷积混合的旋转等变解码器。开发了语义感知提示分组(SAPG)技术来聚合多样化的基于对象的提示，更好地整合语义线索。

Result: 在三个标准对称检测数据集(DENDI、SDRW、LDRS)上超越了当前最先进方法。消融实验验证了CLIP预训练、等变解码器和SAPG技术的有效性。

Conclusion: CLIPSym成功证明了预训练视觉语言模型在对称检测任务中的价值，通过创新的提示技术和等变架构设计，显著提升了对称检测性能。

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at
https://github.com/timyoung2333/CLIPSym.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer
vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep
learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains
fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a
comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature
across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as

environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design
considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and
limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields,
we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both
theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This
survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also
drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection,
including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to
real-world deployment.

### [8] [Accelerating Image Classification with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks using Voronoi Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14218)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合Voronoi图和图卷积网络(GCN)的创新图像分类框架NVGCN，通过图结构表示图像，在多个基准数据集上显著提升了预处理时间和分类准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限，需要新的范式来处理图像中的关系数据，图卷积网络提供了建模关系数据的优异能力

Method: 使用基于图的图像表示方法，将像素或区域视为图顶点，通过对应的Delaunay三角剖分进行简化，提出了归一化Voronoi图卷积网络(NVGCN)

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了预处理时间和分类准确率的显著提升，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度类别场景中超越了现有最先进模型，实验通过交叉验证证实了有效性

Conclusion: 该研究为图像分类引入了新颖方法，证明了GCN与Voronoi图结合在图像分类任务中的潜力，为计算机视觉和其他非结构化数据领域的图基学习范式开发开辟了新途径

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了不同数据增强策略对糖尿病视网膜病变分级中保形预测器性能的影响，发现样本混合策略(Mixup和CutMix)不仅能提高预测准确性，还能产生更可靠和高效的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变分级等高风险任务中需要可靠的不确定性量化。虽然保形预测能提供统计保证的预测集，但标准训练实践(如数据增强)与这些保证有效性之间的相互作用尚不明确。

Method: 使用DDR数据集，评估两种骨干架构(ResNet-50和CoaT)在五种增强策略下的表现：无增强、标准几何变换、CLAHE、Mixup和CutMix。分析对保形指标的影响，包括经验覆盖率、平均预测集大小和正确效率。

Result: 样本混合策略(Mixup和CutMix)不仅提高了预测准确性，还产生了更可靠和高效的不确定性估计。相反，CLAHE等方法可能对模型确定性产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 需要将增强策略与下游不确定性量化协同设计，以构建真正值得信赖的医学影像AI系统。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Conclusion: GALA框架通过创新的交叉注意力模块设计，成功实现了高效的开放词汇3D场景理解，在保持特征相似性的同时显著降低了内存需求

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

Conclusion: 这项工作与基准一起为评估未来可解释物体识别模型提供了更完整的框架，解决了现有方法的局限性并提升了性能。

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

*Yuguang Yue,Chris Green,Samuel Hunt,Irakli Salia,Wenzhe Shi,Jonathan J Hunt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixels2Play-0.1是一个基础模型，通过像素输入学习玩各种3D游戏，使用行为克隆和逆动力学模型训练，在消费级GPU上实现低延迟游戏控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足AI队友、可控NPC、个性化直播和辅助测试等新兴需求，需要开发能够基于像素输入、无需游戏特定工程就能泛化到新游戏的智能体。

Method: 使用端到端行为克隆训练，结合人工标注的游戏演示数据和通过逆动力学模型标注的公开视频数据，采用解码器transformer架构实现自回归动作输出。

Result: 在简单Roblox和经典MS-DOS游戏中表现出色，展示了跨游戏泛化能力，并通过无标签数据消融实验验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: 该模型为构建专家级、文本条件控制的游戏AI奠定了基础，展示了通过像素输入实现人类化游戏行为的可行性。

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的多模态多视角视频生成方法，用于自动驾驶场景合成，能够同时生成RGB视频、深度图和语义图等多种模态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动驾驶视频生成方法主要关注RGB视频生成，缺乏多模态生成能力。而多模态数据（如深度图和语义图）对于自动驾驶的整体场景理解至关重要。使用多个模型生成不同模态会增加部署难度且无法利用多模态数据的互补线索。

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于类间关系的损失函数（ICR loss），通过利用对象间的空间关系来改善小目标检测的梯度更新效率，并在新的许可牌检测数据集上验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于IoU的损失函数在小目标检测中存在梯度更新效率低的问题，导致小目标学习困难。研究者发现利用对象间的空间关系（如车牌与汽车的关联）可以有效地指导小目标的梯度更新。

Method: 提出了类间关系损失函数，当预测的小目标（如车牌）不在其关联的大目标（如汽车）内时，添加损失惩罚。该惩罚与汽车和预测车牌边框的重叠面积成反比，可以无缝集成到现有IoU损失中。

Result: 在新的SVMLP车牌检测数据集上，ICR损失在YOLOv12-T上提升mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ 10.3%，在UAV-DETR上提升1.6%，无需额外调参。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用对象间空间关系，有效解决了小目标检测中的梯度更新问题，并可以简单集成到现有检测算法中。

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

Motivation: 目前缺乏公开的数据集来支持自动化分析细胞对Taxol化疗的形态学响应，而现有检测方法需要专业设备和复杂的样品处理，成本高且不适合高速通量分析。

Method: 构建了一个包含不同Taxol浓度处理的C6脑杂胞研细胞显微镜图像数据集，并提出ResAttention-KNN基线模型，结合ResNet-50、卷积注意力模块和k近邻分类器。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了Taxol化疗自动化形态学分析领域的数据集空白，为医学图像分析研究提供了重要的公开资源和基准模型。

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

TL;DR: HRC-Pose是一个基于深度信息的类别级物体姿态估计框架，通过对比学习保持6D姿态连续性，在旋转和平移分量上分别处理，在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖6D姿态作为监督信号，未能显式捕捉姿态的内在连续性，导致预测不一致和对未见姿态泛化能力降低。

Method: 提出HRC-Pose深度框架，使用对比学习学习点云表示，解耦旋转和平移分量分别编码，基于6D姿态感知的分层排序方案设计对比学习策略，并分别处理学习到的旋转感知和平移感知嵌入。

Result: 实验证明HRC-Pose成功学习了连续特征空间，在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中一致优于现有深度方法，且能够实时运行。

Conclusion: HRC-Pose通过对比学习有效解决了姿态连续性问题，在类别级物体姿态估计任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种离散化的情感可控说话人脸生成方法，通过预训练策略分离音频组件、量化视频为视觉标记，并引入情感锚点表示来整合情感信息，使用自回归变换器生成情感化视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感可控说话人脸生成的两个关键挑战：如何有效建模与特定情感相关的多模态关系，以及如何利用这种关系合成保持身份特征的情感化视频。

Method: 采用两种预训练策略将音频分解为独立组件并将视频量化为视觉标记的组合；提出情感锚点(EA)表示将情感信息整合到视觉标记中；使用自回归变换器建模视觉标记的全局分布并预测索引序列来合成视频。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上进行了实验，控制基于多种情感音频的视频情感生成，大量实验证明该方法在定性和定量评估上都表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效实现情感可控的说话人脸生成，通过离散化处理和情感锚点表示成功解决了多模态关系建模和身份保持的情感视频合成问题。

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多目标跟踪系统主要针对行人跟踪，对其他物体类别的泛化能力有限，需要开发能够处理多种物体类型的通用跟踪框架。

Method: 方法包含两个关键组件：(1) 遮挡感知的重识别机制，增强对严重遮挡物体的身份保持；(2) 道路结构感知的轨迹优化策略，利用车道方向、人行横道、道路边界等语义场景先验来改善轨迹连续性和准确性。

Result: 在新建的数据集和多个公共基准测试中均取得稳健性能，在MOT17和MOT20测试集上分别获得66.4和65.7的HOTA分数。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于通用的多类跟踪，在传统基准测试中也表现出强大性能，证明了其在通用目标跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

TL;DR: 提出TCFNet，一种基于Transformer的粗到细点云运动网络，用于正颌手术规划中的面部-骨骼点云转换，解决了传统方法和现有深度学习方法在计算效率、精度和可扩展性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生物力学模拟方法计算耗时、数据处理繁琐且精度低，而现有的深度学习方法存在处理大规模点云能力有限、感受野受限导致噪声点、需要复杂的预处理和后处理操作等问题，限制了性能和广泛应用。

Method: 提出两阶段端到端框架：第一阶段使用基于Transformer的网络，第二阶段使用局部信息聚合网络(LIA-Net)。LIA-Net通过建模局部几何结构（边缘、方向和相对位置特征）来补偿Transformer网络的邻域精度损失，并利用门控循环单元引导局部位移。还提出了利用专家知识重建关键器官的辅助损失函数。

Result: 在收集的数据集上与现有最先进方法相比，TCFNet在评估指标和可视化结果方面表现优异。

Conclusion: TCFNet通过结合Transformer的全局建模能力和LIA-Net的局部几何结构建模，实现了精确的点云转换，为正颌手术规划提供了有效的计算机辅助模拟解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示方法通过复杂激活函数来缓解频谱偏差，但带来了显著的硬件开销。需要开发一种既能保持性能又能大幅降低硬件消耗的解决方案。

Method: 提出QuadINR方法，使用分段二次激活函数，其傅里叶级数包含丰富的谐波内容，增强了高频信号的表达能力。开发了统一的N级流水线框架，支持多种激活函数的高效硬件实现。

Result: 在图像和视频实验中，QuadINR相比现有方法PSNR提升最高达2.06dB，面积仅1914μm²，动态功耗6.14mW，资源消耗降低97%，功耗降低97%，延迟改善93%。

Conclusion: QuadINR通过硬件友好的分段二次激活函数，在保持优异性能的同时大幅降低了硬件实现成本，为隐式神经表示的实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着空间转录组学分辨率不断提高（如Visium HD达到8um），传统逐点回归方法变得低效不稳定，且高分辨率数据的极端稀疏性和低表达水平给预测和评估带来挑战。

Method: 采用全卷积架构将HD ST数据建模为超像素表示，将任务重新定义为具有数百或数千输出通道的超内容图像生成问题，并引入专门针对高分辨率ST分析的SSIM-ST评估指标。

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net为大规模高效准确的空间转录组学推断提供了原则性解决方案，为下一代稳健且分辨率感知的ST建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Flux等英语训练的文生图模型在处理中文等非英语提示时的语言和文化偏见问题，充分理解中文特有语义和文化内涵。

Method: 采用多模态涵布Transformer(MMDiT)技术直接控制Flux核心模型，大幅减少参数量的同时提升中文语义理解能力。

Result: 实验评估显示CTA-Flux能够同时支持中英文提示，在图像生成质量、视觉真实性和中文语义准确性方面都取得优异表现。

Conclusion: 该方法在不需大规模重新训练整个模型的情况下，有效解决了英语中心TTI模型的中文语义理解问题，保持了与现有插件的兼容性。

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Method: 包含解耦摩尔纹自适应(DMAD)和时空自适应(STAD)两个组件。DMAD通过MDB和DDB分离摩尔纹与内容，MCB生成摩尔纹自适应特征；STAD使用SFB捕捉大尺度结构，FCA建模通道依赖，无需显式对齐模块实现时间一致性

Result: 在两个视频数据集(RAW和sRGB域)上，MoCHA-former在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上均超越现有方法

Conclusion: MoCHA-former通过创新的解耦和自适应机制，有效解决了相机拍摄屏幕时的摩尔纹问题，在定量和定性评估中均表现出色

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D人体姿态估计面临深度模糊和遮挡挑战，传统方法在利用骨架结构信息时可能忽略多尺度特征，影响估计精度。

Method: 提出HyperDiff方法，集成扩散模型和HyperGCN。扩散模型捕捉数据不确定性，缓解深度模糊和遮挡；HyperGCN作为去噪器，使用多粒度结构精确建模关节间的高阶相关性。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上实现最先进性能，能够灵活适应不同计算资源以平衡性能与效率。

Conclusion: HyperDiff通过结合扩散模型和超图卷积网络，有效解决了单目3D姿态估计中的关键挑战，在精度和灵活性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种基于频率调节的扩散驱动输入适应方法，通过在去噪过程中使用空间自适应频率先验来保持任务相关的语义信息，解决测试时适应中知识保持与领域适应之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时适应方法在适应领域变化时容易忘记任务相关知识，需要在保持知识和适应领域变化之间找到平衡。

Method: 提出FOCUS方法，使用训练好的轻量级Y形频率预测网络(Y-FPN)从噪声图像中分离高低频信息，结合FrequencyMix数据增强方法，在扩散驱动的去噪过程中通过频率先验条件化来保持语义信息。

Result: 在15种损坏类型和三个数据集上的语义分割和单目深度估计任务中达到最先进的平均性能，并能通过FOCUS去噪图像生成伪标签来补充现有模型适应方法。

Conclusion: FOCUS有效解决了测试时适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，既能提升独立性能，又能作为现有模型适应方法的补充，在有限监督下仍能保持良好性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在多主体组合合成中难以同时实现精确的空间控制和身份保持，需要一种能够同时满足空间精度和身份保持双重要求的解决方案

Method: 提出串联交叉注意力（CCA）机制，通过显式语义空间扩展将布局规范与文本引导无缝集成；采用渐进式两阶段训练策略，将任务分解为可学习的子目标

Result: MUSE实现了零样本端到端生成，在空间准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有解决方案，推进了可控图像合成的前沿

Conclusion: MUSE框架通过创新的CCA机制和训练策略，成功解决了布局可控多主体合成的关键挑战，为可控图像合成提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: 通过多模态数据融合，特别是NIR数据和植被指数元数据的整合，显著提升了农业场景3D重建的质量和鲁棒性

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,
highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code

Motivation: 解决参与度估计在跨领域部署时泛化性差的问题，以及难以建模复杂交互动态的挑战

Method: 提出DAPA框架：1）领域提示机制-添加可学习的领域特定向量；2）并行交叉注意力模块-对齐参与者的反应性和预期性状态

Result: 在多个跨文化跨语言基准测试中达到SOTA，在NoXi-J测试集上CCC指标提升0.45，获得MultiMediate'25挑战赛第一名

Conclusion: DAPA通过显式的领域适应和交互同步建模，显著提升了对话参与度估计的跨领域泛化能力

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at
MultiMediate'25.

Motivation: 现有3D说话头合成方法需要大量视频数据训练每个新身份，且音频包含与唇部运动无关的信息，导致在少量训练帧下难以实现准确的唇部同步和高质量图像。

Method: 构建静态3D高斯属性场，使用音频和面部运动信号分别控制两个独立的变形场；设计相似性对比损失函数实现更彻底的解耦；集成粗到细模块细化渲染图像。

Result: 大量实验表明，D^3-Talker在有限训练数据下，在高保真渲染和音频-唇部同步准确性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦通用和个性化变形预测，有效解决了少样本3D说话头合成的挑战，实现了高质量的渲染效果和准确的唇部同步。

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多样化场景中实现了最先进的性能，推理速度显著快于其他基于扩散的方法，并且能够以无需训练的方式迁移到视频分解。

Conclusion: Ouroboros框架通过单步扩散模型和循环一致性机制，有效解决了正向和逆向渲染的一致性问题，同时大幅提升了推理速度，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Motivation: 随着视频生成技术的快速发展，定制化视频编辑需求激增，但主题替换这一关键组件仍未被充分探索。现有方法要么局限于狭窄领域，要么依赖间接编辑范式或模糊文本提示，影响最终保真度

Method: 提出mask-guided、subject-agnostic的端到端框架，使用用户指定的掩码和参考图像进行主题替换。引入多重条件和专用条件融合模块提供细粒度指导，设计自适应掩码策略以适应不同尺度和属性的主题

Conclusion: DreamSwapV提供了一个高效、通用的视频主题替换解决方案，能够处理任意主题的替换任务，显著提升了替换质量和与周围环境的交互效果

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing
down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen

Conclusion: Vivid-VR通过创新的训练策略和架构设计，有效解决了视频修复中的分布漂移问题，为可控视频生成提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在复杂提示词的布局和对象关系捕捉方面表现不佳，而基于场景图的方法通常依赖于笨重的GAN或扩散管道，在速度和保真度上落后于现代自回归架构。

Method: 在VAR-CLIP基础上进行轻量级扩展，将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，仅微调VAR变换器，保持CLIP-VQ-VAE主干网络冻结，实现图结构理解。

Result: 在Visual Genome数据集上，FID从56.45%降至21.62%，Inception Score从16.03提升至24.78，超越了SG2IM和SGDiff等方法，无需额外模块或多阶段训练。

Conclusion: SATURN成功地将结构感知能力与最先进的自回归保真度相结合，在对象数量保真度和空间关系准确性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art
autoregressive fidelity.

product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

TL;DR: ScenGE是一个通过大语言模型生成安全关键场景的框架，能够推理新颖的对抗性案例并用复杂交通流放大威胁，相比现有方法能发现更多严重碰撞案例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶安全评估主要依赖预定义的威胁模式或基于规则的策略，无法充分暴露多样化和不可预见的故障模式，需要更有效的场景生成方法。

Method: 首先进行元场景生成，使用基于结构化驾驶知识的大语言模型推断具有威胁性的对抗智能体行为；然后通过复杂场景演化，利用背景车辆放大核心威胁，构建对抗协作图来优化关键轨迹。

Result: 在多个基于强化学习的AV模型上进行的实验显示，ScenGE平均比最先进基线多发现31.96%的严重碰撞案例，并能应用于大模型AV系统，通过对抗训练提高模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架生成的场景既合理又关键，通过真实世界车辆测试和人类评估验证，为建立公众信任和确保安全部署迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

TL;DR: WISE-FUSE是一个自适应全玻片图像编码框架，通过选择性处理诊断相关区域，将编码时间减少三倍以上，同时保持或超越详尽处理的诊断性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全玻片图像(WSI)由于千兆像素规模，需要处理数万到数十万个高分辨率图像块，导致预处理和训练时间长达数天甚至数周，成为实际部署中的主要瓶颈

Method: 利用病理学领域视觉语言模型和大语言模型，通过计算低分辨率图像块与类别特定文本描述的相似度分数，选择信息丰富的区域子集进行选择性编码，并与文本嵌入融合以增强诊断上下文

Result: 实验表明WISE-FUSE将WSI编码时间减少三倍以上，同时达到与详尽图像块处理相当或更好的诊断性能

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE为计算病理学提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，通过选择性处理显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

Method: 提出扩展高斯混合模型(GMM)，交替进行期望最大化(EM)算法和集群内重新对齐过程，结合正态性统计测试

Result: 在各种老化程度的文档中都展现出改善效果，包括乌拉圭军事档案和17-20世纪欧洲报纸

Conclusion: 通过利用文档内部字符形状的重复性，可以有效改善OCR系统在低质量打印文档上的识别性能

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of
high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve
cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel

and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and
present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

Motivation: 现有的可控制运动生成方法主要依赖离散姿态码表示，无法抓取细雅的运动细节，限制了表达能力

Method: 使用残差向量量化(RVQ)技术，在姿态码基础的潜在表示中增强连续运动特征，保持姿态码的可解释性和可操控性

Result: 在HumanML3D数据集上，FID指标从0.041降到0.015，Top-1 R-Precision从0.508提升到0.510，定性分析证明了运动编辑的可控性

Conclusion: 方法有效地结合了离散姿态码的可控性和连续特征的细节表达能力，为文本到运动生成领域提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型需要密集人工标注，成本高昂。无标签方法虽然利用基础模型自动提取概念，但往往无法准确定位概念所在区域，关注不相关的视觉区域。

Method: 提出LCBM框架，为每个概念分配一个原型，通过原型学习确保概念的空间定位准确性。利用基础模型确保原型与相关概念的相关性，并用原型指导学习过程识别正确的局部区域。

Conclusion: LCBM通过结合基础模型和原型学习，成功解决了无标签概念瓶颈模型的概念定位问题，为构建更准确的可解释AI模型提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

Conclusion: GOGS框架有效解决了高光物体逆渲染中的模糊性问题，通过物理准确的渲染和材料分解实现了高质量的几何和材质重建

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

Result: 在MSR-Action3D、NTU RGB+D和Synthia 4D数据集上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: UST-SSM成功将SSM扩展到点云视频，解决了时空无序问题，提升了动作识别性能

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is
available at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.

Conclusion: SMTrack推动了在复杂场景下基于SNN的鲁棒准确跟踪技术的发展，为脉冲神经网络在实时视觉任务中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

TL;DR: AnchorSync是一个基于扩散模型的视频编辑框架，通过分离稀疏锚帧编辑和平滑中间帧插值来解决长视频编辑中的全局一致性和时间连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理分钟级长视频时存在结构漂移和时间伪影问题，需要一种能够保持全局一致性和时间连贯性的高质量长视频编辑方法。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，将编辑任务解耦为稀疏锚帧编辑和平滑中间帧插值，通过渐进去噪过程强制结构一致性，并通过多模态指导保持时间动态。

Result: 大量实验表明，AnchorSync能够产生连贯、高保真度的编辑效果，在视觉质量和时间稳定性方面超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: AnchorSync通过创新的解耦策略和一致性保持机制，成功解决了长视频编辑中的关键挑战，为高质量长视频编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.

TL;DR: PerSense++是一个用于密集图像个性化实例分割的免训练框架，通过密度图生成实例提示点，结合自适应阈值和空间门控来过滤误报，并在复杂场景中通过多样性感知和混合方法提升分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集视觉场景中的分割面临遮挡、背景杂乱和尺度变化的挑战，现有方法在这些情况下表现不佳，需要一种能够处理密集图像的个性化实例分割框架。

Method: 提出PerSense框架，包含实例检测模块(IDM)使用密度图生成候选点提示，点提示选择模块(PPSM)通过自适应阈值和空间门控过滤误报，反馈机制选择有效样本提升密度图质量。PerSense++增加了多样性感知样本选择策略、混合IDM结合轮廓和峰值提示生成，以及不相关掩码拒绝模块(IMRM)。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PerSense++在密集场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PerSense++提供了一个有效的免训练解决方案，用于密集图像中的个性化实例分割，并通过新组件显著提升了在杂乱场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeMS是一个处理严重运动模糊图像的3D高斯泼溅框架，无需依赖清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，通过深度学习SfM和概率分布采样实现直接从模糊输入重建场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，这在严重模糊场景下不现实；基于COLMAP初始化的方法也因特征对应不可靠而失败。

Method: 整合VGGSfM深度学习SfM管道、3DGS-MCMC概率分布采样初始化、相机轨迹与高斯参数联合优化；GeMS-E版本还加入事件驱动的渐进细化步骤。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，是首个直接从严重模糊输入处理极端运动模糊的3DGS框架。

Conclusion: GeMS框架成功解决了从极端模糊图像直接进行3D重建的挑战，无需依赖清晰图像，为处理严重运动模糊场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种模型驱动的方法，通过联合知识转移和保存来训练视觉基础模型，无需大量标注数据和高端GPU


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型主要依赖数据驱动方法，需要大量高质量标注数据和计算资源，这对大多数机构构成瓶颈。而许多开源预训练模型包含可转移的领域专业知识，但未被充分利用来开发通用视觉基础模型

Method: 在共享潜在空间中统一多个预训练教师模型以缓解分布差距导致的"不平衡转移"问题，并采用知识保存策略，将通用教师模型作为知识库，通过适配器模块整合其他特定用途教师模型的知识

Result: 构建的视觉基础模型在图像分类、目标检测、语义分割和实例分割四个基础视觉任务上超越了现有的数据驱动模型

Conclusion: 通过统一和聚合现有模型，可以构建强大的视觉基础模型来继承教师模型的专长，无需大量标注数据训练，同时提供可泛化的视觉特征并支持多下游任务

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

TL;DR: GSFix3D是一个新框架，通过将扩散模型的先验知识蒸馏到3D表示中，提升极端视角和部分观测区域的渲染质量，同时保持与观测场景细节的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在极端新视角或部分观测区域的渲染质量仍有挑战，而扩散模型虽然生成能力强，但缺乏对特定场景信息的感知，难以进行准确的3D重建。

Method: 提出GSFix3D框架，核心是GSFixer（通过定制微调协议获得的潜在扩散模型），利用网格和3D高斯将预训练生成模型适配到不同环境和重建方法的伪影类型，并采用随机掩码增强策略进行缺失区域的合理修复。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，仅需对捕获数据进行最小程度的场景特定微调，实际测试证实其对潜在姿态误差的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSFix3D成功解决了3D渲染中的极端视角和部分观测问题，通过扩散模型知识蒸馏实现了高质量的视图修复，具有很好的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个包含多种光照条件和相机传感器的RAW图像数据集，并开发了一种轻量级神经网络方法用于光照和传感器映射，在神经ISP训练中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW图像具有传感器和光照特定的特性，这使得为深度学习捕获RAW数据集具有挑战性，因为需要为每个传感器和广泛的光照条件捕获场景。需要开发光照增强和传感器间映射的方法来减轻数据采集负担。

Method: 使用定制化的可调光谱光照箱，在390种光照条件下使用4台不同相机捕获18个场景，构建了首个此类数据集。并提出了一个轻量级神经网络方法用于光照和传感器映射。

Result: 提出的方法在竞争方法中表现优异，并在下游任务（训练神经ISP）中证明了其效用。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决RAW图像数据采集挑战提供了有效解决方案，通过光照和传感器映射方法显著减少了数据捕获需求，为深度学习在RAW图像处理中的应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

*Fabian Holst,Emre Gülsoylu,Simone Frintrop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过融合单目RGB图像与AIS数据，提出了一种新的海上船船6D姿势估计数据集创建技术，解决了依赖单纯AIS数据的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AIS系统存在设备可靠性问题、数据精度不高、传输延迟等限制，需要结合视觉信息来提高海上船船姿势估计的准确性。

Method: 使用YOLOX-X目标检测网络从RGB图像中检测船船，然后通过射影变换方法（单应映和PnP）将AIS数据与图像坐标对齐，生成6D姿势标注。

Result: PnP方法比单应映方法折射误差显著降低，YOLOX-X模型在IoU阈值0.5时达到0.80 mAP。创建了包含3753张图像的BONK-pose公开数据集。

Conclusion: 该技术能够在不需人工标注的情况下自动创建高质量的6D姿势估计数据集，为海上船船自动驾驶和监控应用提供了重要数据支持。

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

Conclusion: 提出的过滤和精炼算法对性能提升有显著贡献，MF-LPR²框架能有效提升低质量车牌图像的恢复质量和识别精度，同时保持输入图像的证据内容

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

Motivation: 解决高速运动物体6-DoF位始追踪问题，充分利用事件相机高时间分辣率优势和RGB相机丰富视觉信息优势

Method: 结合事件基光流算法进行物体运动测量，实现物体6-DoF速度追踪器，并与低频全局位始估计结果集成

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证有效性，特别在高速运动场景中表现优异

Conclusion: 方法能够有效解决高速运动物体6-DoF位始追踪挑战，突破传统相机的帧率限制和运动模糊问题

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Result: 在腹部MR-CT注册中获得最高Dice分数0.790，最低HD95为4.9，最低SDLogJ为0.08；在ACDC心脏MRI中Dice分数提升到0.769，SDLogJ降低到0.11，HD95为4.8

Conclusion: 在紧凑的基础特征空间中进行测试时注册提供了一种无需训练的实用临床解决方案

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

Conclusion: 提出的对抗框架能够有效缓解病理学基础模型中的医院偏差问题，为PFMs的临床部署提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

Motivation: 现有光照编辑方法无法同时提供定制化的光照效果控制和保持内容完整性，特别是在将复杂光照效果从参考图像传输到目标图像时效果不佳。

Method: 使用两个微调的扩散模型进行生成式解耦，准确分离图像内容和光照效果，构建百万级图像-内容-光照三元组数据集，然后使用IC-Light作为生成模型进行训练。

Conclusion: 该框架通过彻底解耦参考图像中的光照效果，赋予了TransLight高度灵活的光照控制能力，为光照协调和编辑研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination

*Canyu Zhao,Xiaoman Li,Tianjian Feng,Zhiyue Zhao,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tinker是一个无需场景微调的高保真3D编辑框架，支持单次和少次编辑，通过重新利用预训练扩散模型实现多视角一致性编辑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术需要大量每场景优化来确保多视角一致性，Tinker旨在从少量图像实现鲁棒的多视角一致编辑，降低3D内容创作门槛

Method: 包含两个核心组件：(1)参考多视角编辑器实现精确的参考驱动编辑；(2)任意视角到视频合成器利用视频扩散的空间-时间先验进行场景补全和新视角生成

Result: 在编辑、新视角合成和渲染增强任务上达到最先进性能，显著降低了通用3D内容创作的障碍

Conclusion: Tinker代表了向真正可扩展、零样本3D编辑的关键一步

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频-语言检索框架，通过细粒度特征学习和推理管道改进性能，无需额外训练即可显著提升检索准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频流媒体爆炸式增长带来高精度和低训练成本的挑战，现有方法依赖大规模预训练导致计算需求大，且视频文本的细粒度信息未被充分探索

Method: 采用粗到细目标理解视频-文本对的语义信息，包括对比学习和匹配学习；通过粒度感知表示模块获取细粒度训练数据；提出包含投票机制和匹配熵度量的推理管道

Result: 在四个基准测试中优于先前方法，推理管道在MSR-VTT数据集上Recall@1提升2.1%，在DiDeMo数据集上提升1.6%

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了视频-语言检索中的细粒度对齐问题，通过创新的训练和推理策略实现了性能显著提升，且无需额外预训练成本

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventSSEG是一种基于事件相机的道路分割方法，采用事件计算和概率注意力机制，通过自监督学习解决标注数据稀缺问题，在DSEC-Semantic和DDD17数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧相机在自动驾驶道路分割中存在延迟高和计算量大的问题，事件相机提供了低功耗感知的替代方案，但缺乏标注数据限制了其应用。

Method: 提出EventSSEG方法，使用纯事件计算和概率注意力机制，采用基于事件的自监督学习来避免对大量标注数据的依赖。

Result: 在DSEC-Semantic和DDD17数据集上的实验表明，EventSSEG仅需少量标注事件就能达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法充分利用了事件相机的优势，有效解决了标注事件数据稀缺的问题，为自动驾驶道路分割提供了低延迟、低计算量的解决方案。

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Motivation: 理解腺脱变化对于检测类型2糖尿病和其他腺脱疾病至关重要，需要建立正常腺脱老化趋势的规范参考

Method: 分析2533名患者的腺部CT或MRI执行，采用自动化方法分割腺脱并提取13个形态特征，使用GAMLSS回归模型分析类型2糖尿病对腺脱形态的影响

Result: 在调整混杂因素后，13个形态特征中有10个在类型2糖尿病患者中显示出显著不同的老化趋势，同时发现MRI和CT的测量结果存在差异

Conclusion: 研究提供了腺脱生命周期形态变化趋势，确认类型2糖尿病患者腺脱更小，并为临床应用提供了大规模非糖尿病对照组的参考数据

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

TL;DR: 提出了多骨架对比学习框架MS-CLR，通过跨不同骨架结构对齐姿态表示来学习结构不变性，在NTU数据集上取得了新的SOTA结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法依赖单一骨架结构，限制了在不同关节结构和解剖覆盖的数据集上的泛化能力

Method: 使用多骨架对比学习框架，从同一序列中提取多个骨架结构并对其姿态表示进行对齐，采用统一的表示方案处理不同关节布局和尺度的骨架

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60和120数据集上，MS-CLR持续优于强单骨架对比学习基线，多骨架集成进一步提升了性能

Conclusion: 多骨架对比学习能够学习更具表达力和泛化能力的特征，通过结构不变性和多样化解剖线索的捕捉，显著提升了骨架动作识别性能

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了统一关节表示在可扩展物理建模中的潜力，适用于机器人仿真和人机交互建模等下游任务。

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工程教育框架僵化，忽视学生多样化学习需求，在线教育和个性化学习在K-12和基础科学领域已有进展，但工程教育在这方面落后。传统评估方法无法满足个性化教育需求。

Method: 开发了PAPPL智能辅导系统，集成专家模块、学生模块、导师模块和用户界面，利用GPT-4o大语言模型提供情境敏感的提示和教学反馈，记录学生尝试、检测误解并生成渐进式针对性反馈。

Result: 系统能够动态适应每个学生的学习档案，为教师提供详细分析数据，支持基于证据的教学策略调整。

Conclusion: 该研究为生成式智能辅导系统提供了可扩展到所有教育层级的基础框架，展示了生成式AI在教育领域的广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Engineering education has historically been constrained by rigid,
standardized frameworks, often neglecting students' diverse learning needs and
interests. While significant advancements have been made in online and
personalized education within K-12 and foundational sciences, engineering
education at both undergraduate and graduate levels continues to lag in
adopting similar innovations. Traditional evaluation methods, such as exams and
homework assignments, frequently overlook individual student requirements,
impeding personalized educational experiences. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces the Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning (PAPPL)
platform, an advanced Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) designed specifically
for engineering education. It highlights the development of a scalable,
data-driven tutoring environment leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to
enhance personalized learning across diverse academic disciplines, particularly
in STEM fields. PAPPL integrates core ITS components including the expert
module, student module, tutor module, and user interface, and utilizes GPT-4o,
a sophisticated large language model (LLM), to deliver context-sensitive and
pedagogically sound hints based on students' interactions. The system uniquely
records student attempts, detects recurring misconceptions, and generates
progressively targeted feedback, providing personalized assistance that adapts
dynamically to each student's learning profile. Additionally, PAPPL offers
instructors detailed analytics, empowering evidence-based adjustments to
teaching strategies. This study provides a fundamental framework for the
progression of Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, delivering
important perspectives on personalized progressive learning and the wider
possibilities of Generative AI in the field of education.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了非洲25个国家157名AI专业人士对AI信任的理解，发现教育背景、跨国流动和原籍国影响他们对AI系统的关注点，强调社区关系而非个人自由，并将非洲关系主义融入国际信任概念中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI信任研究主要基于西方社会(WEIRD)，缺乏非洲视角。非洲少数相关研究也未包含AI开发者、研究者和使用者的观点，需要探索非洲专业人士如何概念化AI信任。

Method: 对来自25个非洲国家的157名具有AI专业和/或教育背景的人士进行问卷调查，多数参与者参加过纳米比亚和加纳的AI信任研讨会。

Result: 受访者的教育背景、跨国流动和原籍国影响他们对AI系统的担忧程度，强调社区价值观而非个人自由，将非洲关系主义 nuances 融入可靠性、依赖性等国际信任概念中。

Conclusion: 这项探索性研究呼吁更多实证研究，关注非洲社会现实中AI设计、使用和治理过程中信任的实际实践和体验方式。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of AI is considered essential to the adoption and
application of AI systems. However, the meaning of trust varies across
industry, research and policy spaces. Studies suggest that professionals who
develop and use AI regard an AI system as trustworthy based on their personal
experiences and social relations at work. Studies about trust in AI and the
constructs that aim to operationalise trust in AI (e.g., consistency,
reliability, explainability and accountability). However, the majority of
existing studies about trust in AI are situated in Western, Educated,
Industrialised, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. The few studies about
trust and AI in Africa do not include the views of people who develop, study or
use AI in their work. In this study, we surveyed 157 people with professional
and/or educational interests in AI from 25 African countries, to explore how
they conceptualised trust in AI. Most respondents had links with workshops
about trust and AI in Africa in Namibia and Ghana. Respondents' educational
background, transnational mobility, and country of origin influenced their
concerns about AI systems. These factors also affected their levels of distrust
in certain AI applications and their emphasis on specific principles designed
to foster trust. Respondents often expressed that their values are guided by
the communities in which they grew up and emphasised communal relations over
individual freedoms. They described trust in many ways, including applying
nuances of Afro-relationalism to constructs in international discourse, such as
reliability and reliance. Thus, our exploratory study motivates more empirical
research about the ways trust is practically enacted and experienced in African
social realities of AI design, use and governance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from
financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic
literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms
that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available
repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms.
Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial
set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow
with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used
in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams
of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository,
we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of
deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving
tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.

Motivation: 解决电子健康记录中性别数据收集不完整的问题，提高跨性别和性别多样化人群在生物医学研究中的可见性。

Method: 使用算法从诊断代码、用药历史和临床记录等可用数据推断患者性别。

Result: 计算表型分析虽然旨在改善性别数据完整性，但可能带来算法输出被滥用的方法学和伦理问题。

Conclusion: 需要批判性地审视性别计算表型分析实践，制定明确的指导原则，并优先开展相关伦理和方法学研究。

Abstract: Computational phenotyping has emerged as a practical solution to the
incomplete collection of data on gender in electronic health records (EHRs).
This approach relies on algorithms to infer a patient's gender using the
available data in their health record, such as diagnosis codes, medication
histories, and information in clinical notes. Although intended to improve the
visibility of trans and gender-expansive populations in EHR-based biomedical
research, computational phenotyping raises significant methodological and
ethical concerns related to the potential misuse of algorithm outputs. In this
paper, we review current practices for computational phenotyping of gender and
examine its challenges through a critical lens. We also highlight existing
recommendations for biomedical researchers and propose priorities for future
work in this domain.

Abstract: This paper, submitted to the special track on resources for teaching AI in
K-12, presents an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based classroom game "Breakable Machine"
for teaching critical, transformative AI literacy through adversarial play and
interrogation of AI systems. Designed for learners aged 10-15, the game invites
students to spoof an image classifier by manipulating their appearance or
environment in order to trigger high-confidence misclassifications. Rather than
focusing on building AI models, this activity centers on breaking them-exposing
their brittleness, bias, and vulnerability through hands-on, embodied
experimentation. The game includes an XAI view to help students visualize
feature saliency, revealing how models attend to specific visual cues. A shared
classroom leaderboard fosters collaborative inquiry and comparison of
strategies, turning the classroom into a site for collective sensemaking. This
approach reframes AI education by treating model failure and misclassification
not as problems to be debugged, but as pedagogically rich opportunities to
interrogate AI as a sociotechnical system. In doing so, the game supports
students in developing data agency, ethical awareness, and a critical stance
toward AI systems increasingly embedded in everyday life. The game and its
source code are freely available.

Method: 借鉴系统安全方法，提出包含系统相关因素、上下文因素和认知因素的三类事故原因框架，并识别有助于澄清事故因素的具体信息类型

Result: 开发了一个全面的代理事故分析框架，明确了事故报告应包含的信息类型以及开发者和部署者应保留的信息

Conclusion: 随着代理世界的到来，理解代理事故对于风险管理至关重要，该框架为新兴事故报告流程的开发提供了指导

Abstract: As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing
number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly
cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private
information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such
incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent
future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not
sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are
largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but
potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or
browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting
processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on
systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that
can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual
(e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user
request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which
factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation
and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide
recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2)
what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to
incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more
agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for
managing risks.

Conclusion: 媒体叙事优先考虑机构对生成式AI的应对措施，而非长期的伦理、社会和劳动相关影响，塑造了主要通过适应和创新视角构建教育中生成式AI的社会技术想象。

Abstract: This study investigates how U.S. news media framed the use of ChatGPT in
higher education from November 2022 to October 2024. Employing Framing Theory
and combining temporal and sentiment analysis of 198 news articles, we trace
the evolving narratives surrounding generative AI. We found that the media
discourse largely centered on institutional responses; policy changes and
teaching practices showed the most consistent presence and positive sentiment
over time. Conversely, coverage of topics such as human-centered learning, the
job market, and skill development appeared more sporadically, with initially
uncertain portrayals gradually shifting toward cautious optimism. Importantly,
media sentiment toward ChatGPT's role in college admissions remained
predominantly negative. Our findings suggest that media narratives prioritize
institutional responses to generative AI over long-term, broader ethical,
social, and labor-related implications, shaping an emerging sociotechnical
imaginary that frames generative AI in education primarily through the lens of
adaptation and innovation.

### [81] [An Investigation Into Secondary School Students' Debugging Behaviour in Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14833)
*Laurie Gale,Sue Sentance*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究分析了K-12学生在文本编程语言中的调试行为，发现大多数学生调试效率低下，虽然能部分定位错误但难以解决，有时还会引入新错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解初学者在文本编程语言中的调试过程，识别他们面临的困难和误解，以改进调试教学方法。

Method: 收集73名学生在在线代码编辑器中完成调试练习的日志数据，通过定性内容分析进行归纳分析，生成调试行为分类。

Result: 学生表现出多种调试行为，但多数效率低下。大多数学生能部分定位错误但难以解决，有时还会引入额外错误。

Conclusion: K-12学习者在文本编程语言调试中存在显著困难，需要明确教授有效的调试策略，同时避免无效策略。

Abstract: Background and context: Debugging is a common and often frustrating challenge
for beginner programmers. Understanding students' debugging processes can help
us identify the difficulties and misunderstandings they possess. However, we
currently have limited knowledge of how secondary students debug in a
text-based language, a medium through which millions of students will learn to
program in the future. Objectives: In this paper, we investigate the debugging
behaviour of K-12 students learning a text-based programming language, as part
of an effort to shape how to effectively teach debugging to these students.
Method: We collected log data from 73 students attempting a set of debugging
exercises using an online code editor. We inductively analysed these logs using
qualitative content analysis, generating a categorisation of the debugging
behaviours observed. Findings: A range of behaviours were exhibited by
students, skewed towards being ineffective. Most students were able to
partially locate errors but often struggled to resolve them, sometimes
introducing additional errors in the process. We argue that students struggling
to debug possess fragile knowledge, a lens through which we view the results.
Implications: This paper highlights some of the difficulties K-12 learners have
when debugging in a text-based programming language. We argue, like much
related work, that effective debugging strategies should be explicitly taught,
while ineffective strategies should be discouraged.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在情感评价任务中与人类表现高度相似，但在唤醒度评分上存在差异，且在五分类情感框架中比二维情感维度框架中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型如何评估情感刺激，以指导LLMs在日常生活和高压任务中的整合应用，评估模型与人类行为的一致性。

Method: 使用先前由人类评分的词汇和图像数据集，让多个流行LLMs进行相同的情感评分任务，比较GPT-4o等模型与人类参与者的评分一致性。

Result: GPT-4o在大多数评分维度上与人类参与者高度相似（r≥0.9），但唤醒度评分一致性较差，幸福感评分一致性最高。LLMs在五分类情感框架中比二维情感维度框架中表现更好，且评分比人类更加同质化。

Conclusion: LLMs在情感刺激解释方面与人类存在相似性和差异，这些结果有助于描述LLM代理如何解释情感刺激，并突显生物智能与人工智能在关键行为领域的异同。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

Motivation: Hitori谜题包含局部约束和连通性约束，需要结合逻辑证明和视觉解释，为SAT求解器和LLMs的灵活组合提供了理想的测试平台

Method: 开发了一个神经符号工具，结合SAT求解器处理局部约束的解析证明，以及LLMs生成视觉解释来处理连通性约束

Result: 实现了辅助人类解决Hitori谜题的工具，并通过实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 神经符号方法能够有效结合决策程序和大型语言模型的优势，为复杂决策序列的解释提供灵活的解决方案

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化建模过程耗时且易出错，严重依赖领域专家。虽然大语言模型在自然语言理解和推理方面显示出潜力，但现有方法存在基准标签错误率高（达42%）、评估范围仅限于最优值、以及多智能体系统或模型微调导致的计算效率低等问题。

Method: 首先通过系统错误校正和更全面的标注增强现有数据集，引入物流领域的新基准LogiOR。提出ORThought框架，利用思维链推理应用专家级优化建模原则来自动化优化建模过程。

Conclusion: 提供了方法的系统分析，识别了关键成功因素和失败模式，为基于LLM的优化建模未来研究提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

Result: 模型有效区分了人类与代理的行为差异，为解决数据污染和责任归属问题提供了理论框架，验证了在真实网络安全场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为人机安全协作奠定了理论基础，未来需要发展动态认知治理架构、行为差异量化和元治理协议栈等方向，推动可信人机协作生态建设。

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探索了使用规划器生成的结构化示例来提升LLM智能体视角采择能力，发现虽然能减少澄清请求和行动步骤，但结构化示例本身不足以实现稳健的视角采择，需要显式信念跟踪和成本建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要主动感知、协作推理和视角采择的任务中仍面临挑战，研究旨在通过结构化示例提升LLM智能体在这些复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 提出结构化解决方案处理流程，从Fast Downward规划器生成的解决方案图中提取三类示例：最优目标路径(G型)、信息节点路径(E型)和对比替代行动的最优决策序列(L型)，并将其转换为"思考-行动"示例。

Result: L型示例略微减少了澄清请求和总体行动步骤，但未能带来一致性的改进。智能体在需要基本注意力过滤的任务中成功，但在需要心理化遮挡空间或权衡认知行动成本的场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 结构化示例本身不足以实现稳健的视角采择，需要显式信念跟踪、成本建模和更丰富的环境来支持LLM智能体的社会性协作能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端城市降雨事件频发导致严重交通拥堵和服务中断，现有方法在管理竞争目标权衡、应对快速变化环境条件以及确保LLM生成策略的语义稳定性方面存在不足，需要统一的感知、全局优化和多智能体协调框架。

Method: 提出H-J分层多智能体框架，整合知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化，建立从多源感知到战略执行和持续优化的闭环流水线。

Result: 在真实城市拓扑和降雨数据上的实验表明，H-J在极端降雨、间歇性暴雨和日常小雨三种代表性条件下，在交通流畅度、任务成功率和系统鲁棒性方面均优于基于规则和强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，不确定性感知、知识约束的LLM方法在增强城市洪水响应韧性方面具有巨大潜力，为动态应急调度提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于简单，无法捕捉真实应用中的挑战，如长时程推理和大规模不熟悉工具空间，需要更全面的评估标准。

Method: 开发包含6个核心领域11个MCP服务器的基准测试，采用执行式评估器（格式评估器、静态评估器和动态评估器）进行严格评估。

Result: 顶级模型如GPT-5(43.72%)、Grok-4(33.33%)和Claude-4.0-Sonnet(29.44%)表现显著受限，面临长上下文和未知工具挑战。

Conclusion: MCP-Universe填补了关键空白，为MCP生态系统提供了可扩展的评估框架，推动LLM与外部工具交互能力的创新研究。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

Conclusion: 该方法成功建立了离散逻辑与概率可达性分析之间的联系，为CPS系统安全验证提供了数据驱动的解决方案

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了将表格学生数据转换为图结构（主要通过聚类技术）是否能提高辍学预测准确性。研究发现特定的GNN配置（基于PCA-KMeans聚类的GraphSAGE）比传统表格模型表现更好，但其他图构建方法效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生辍学是全球教育系统面临的重大挑战，预测有辍学风险的学生可以及时干预。虽然传统机器学习模型在表格数据上表现良好，但图神经网络（GNNs）有潜力通过捕捉学生数据中固有的复杂关系来提升预测性能。

Method: 研究比较了GNNs（自定义GCN和GraphSAGE）在生成图上的性能与成熟表格模型（随机森林、XGBoost和TabNet）。实验探索了基于不同聚类算法（K-Means、HDBSCAN）和降维技术（PCA、UMAP）的各种图构建策略。

Result: 特定GNN配置（基于PCA-KMeans聚类的GraphSAGE）实现了最佳性能，相比最强表格基线（XGBoost）将宏F1分数提高了约7个百分点，准确率提高了近2个百分点。但其他GNN配置和图构建方法并未始终超越表格模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明GNNs在辍学预测方面具有潜力，但图生成策略和GNN架构选择至关重要。这突显了GNNs的潜力以及在该领域将表格数据最优转换为图学习数据的挑战。

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

Motivation: 现实数据集中的稀疏性（缺失值或零值）给数据分析带来重大挑战，特别是在电力负荷预测领域需要处理大量稀疏数据。

Method: 对小时级电力负荷数据进行统计分析，使用高斯插值法处理稀疏数据，并训练多种机器学习和深度学习模型（包括LSTM神经网络）进行负荷预测。

Conclusion: 高斯插值是处理电力负荷预测中稀疏数据问题的有效方法，LSTM神经网络在该领域具有优越的预测能力。

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出MCLPD半监督学习框架，通过多视图对比预训练和轻量级监督微调，显著提升帕金森病跨数据集检测性能，减少对标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG数据标注成本高导致数据集规模有限且存在差异，严重影响模型在跨数据集检测中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: MCLPD框架包含自监督预训练和监督微调两个阶段：预训练阶段在未标注UNM数据集上进行时间域和频率域双重增强的对比学习；微调阶段仅使用少量标注数据（UI和UC数据集的1%-5%）进行监督优化。

Result: 仅使用1%标注数据时，在UI和UC数据集上分别达到0.91和0.81的F1分数；使用5%标注数据时，性能进一步提升至0.97和0.87，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCLPD框架有效提升了跨数据集泛化能力，大幅减少了对标注数据的依赖，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

Motivation: 现有的奖励模型难以捕捉细微的、用户特定的偏好，特别是在数据有限和跨领域的情况下，需要开发能够从少量个人示例中有效学习个性化偏好的方法。

Method: 结合合成数据生成和两阶段训练流程（监督微调后接强化微调），专门设计用于从一两个个人示例中识别和表示个人因素。

Result: 实验结果表明PersRM-R1在准确性和泛化能力方面都优于相似规模的现有模型，并能与更大模型的性能相匹配。

Conclusion: 该框架为更有效的个性化大语言模型铺平了道路，解决了有限数据可用性和鲁棒泛化需求的挑战。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

TL;DR: 提出结合生产力指数特征选择和归纳共形预测的机器学习框架，用于提高油气产量预测的鲁棒性和不确定性量化，LSTM模型在测试中表现最佳。

Method: 整合生产力指数驱动的特征选择和归纳共形预测框架，使用LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU和XGBoost等算法，采用MAE、预测偏差和预测方向准确性等指标进行评估。

Result: LSTM模型在PF14井测试集和真实样本外预测中均取得最低MAE（分别为19.468和29.638），PI特征选择有效降低了输入维度，ICP框架提供了可靠的预测区间。

Conclusion: 将领域专业知识与先进机器学习技术相结合，能够显著提高油气产量预测的可靠性，为复杂非正态数据的预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

Conclusion: 提出的对比自学习框架能够有效利用未标注时空数据，通过自监督预训练和微调相结合的方式，显著提升了POI人群流量推断的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

Conclusion: EEGDM为EEG表征学习提供了一种有前景的替代方案，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法主要关注个体移动模式，而集体异常检测需要建模个体间的时空依赖关系，这是一个未被充分探索的挑战领域。

Method: 提出CoBAD模型，使用集体事件序列和共现事件图表示问题，采用两阶段注意力机制建模个体移动模式和跨个体交互，通过掩码事件和链接重构任务进行预训练。

Result: 在大规模移动数据集上的实验显示，CoBAD在AUCROC指标上提升13%-18%，在AUCPR指标上提升19%-70%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CoBAD成功解决了集体移动行为异常检测问题，特别是能够检测被先前工作忽视的缺失异常类型，为公共安全和城市规划应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的从GNN提取Datalog规则的方法仅限于低表达力的图编码/解码方式，无法处理使用评分函数进行链接预测的通用方法，需要开发更通用的规则提取技术。

Method: 通过使图神经网络和评分函数单调化，利用单调性提取可靠的解释规则，并为特定类别的单调GNN定义等价的Datalog程序生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，在链接预测基准测试中，单调化的GNN和评分函数在实践中表现良好，并能产生大量可靠的规则。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将规则提取技术扩展到使用评分函数的通用链接预测方法，为GNN的可解释性提供了更强大的工具，同时保持了良好的预测性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

Conclusion: 物理信息奖励机(pRMs)提供了更可编程、表达性更强且高效的强化学习方法，通过分离已知环境知识和未知探索部分，有效降低了样本复杂度

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Motivation: 语言模型微调中高质量训练数据收集成本高昂，预算限制下需要研究如何选择最有价值的样本（难易程度不同的样本）来最大化性能提升

Result: 训练最难样本获得最大性能提升（高达47%），训练简单样本获得最小提升。困难样本在GRPO训练中提供更多可学习机会

Conclusion: 对于预算受限的后训练，优先选择困难样本可以在推理任务上获得显著性能提升，这为资源受限的对齐任务提供了实用指导

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

Conclusion: 该智慧框架能够不依赖传感器设备预测停车位占用情况，随机森林模型在当前数据条件下表现最好，为大学校园停车管理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

Motivation: 当前时间序列分类方法在处理分布外数据时存在性能不可靠的问题，主要原因是模型将领域特定特征和标签相关特征纠缠在一起，形成伪相关性。现有的特征解耦方法缺乏语义指导，无法有效分离真正通用的特征。

Method: 提出端到端的ERIS框架，包含三个核心机制：1）能量引导校准机制提供语义指导；2）权重级正交性策略强制领域特定特征和标签相关特征的结构独立性；3）辅助对抗训练机制通过注入结构化扰动增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，ERIS相比最先进基线方法平均准确率提升4.04%。

Conclusion: ERIS框架通过语义引导的特征解耦方法，有效解决了时间序列分类中的分布外泛化问题，证明了语义指导在特征解耦中的重要性。

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

TL;DR: STAS框架通过时空自适应计算时间设计，解决了SNN视觉Transformer的高延迟和计算开销问题，在降低能耗的同时提升准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络(SNNs)虽然比人工神经网络(ANNs)更节能，但由于多时间步操作特性导致高延迟和计算开销。现有动态计算方法碎片化，且自适应计算时间(ACT)原则在SNN-based ViTs应用中存在时间相似性前提违反和静态架构不匹配两大核心问题

Method: 提出STAS框架，包含集成脉冲补丁分割(I-SPS)模块建立时间稳定性，创建统一输入表示；自适应脉冲自注意力(A-SSA)模块在时空两个维度进行token剪枝

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上验证，能耗分别降低45.9%、43.8%和30.1%，同时准确率超过SOTA模型

Conclusion: STAS通过协同设计静态架构和动态计算策略，成功解决了SNN视觉Transformer的时间相似性问题，实现了能耗降低和性能提升的双重目标

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于元学习的框架，利用多城市数据训练模型来估计交通网络宏观基本图，解决检测器数据不足的问题，在不同城市拓扑结构和检测器配置下都表现出良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统宏观基本图估计需要大量环路检测器数据，但实践中往往数据稀缺。需要开发能够跨城市泛化、适应不同检测器配置的方法。

Method: 采用元学习方法，训练多任务物理信息神经网络，利用多个城市的数据来建模其他城市的宏观基本图，适应不同的检测器比例和拓扑结构。

Result: 流量预测的平均MSE改进在17500到36000之间，成功实现了跨不同城市环境的泛化，在数据有限的城市上性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 元学习框架有效解决了检测器数据稀缺问题，相比传统迁移学习方法表现更好，证明了在有限检测器情况下使用元学习的潜力。

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

Conclusion: 这是首个将生物观测到的功能连接模式作为结构偏置融入ANN设计的架构，证明了生物启发的稀疏连接模式在提升神经网络效率和性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了记忆摊销推理（MAI）框架，将认知建模为基于记忆循环的推理而非梯度下降重计算，通过结构化重用实现高效推理，并与强化学习建立时间反转对偶关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能本质上是非遍历性的，不是从零开始的均匀采样或优化，而是来自先前推理轨迹的结构化重用。现代AI面临计算瓶颈，需要更高效的推理方法。

Method: 引入记忆摊销推理（MAI）框架，将认知建模为在记忆中的潜在循环上进行推理，通过delta同调理论建立理论基础，将每个皮层柱建模为对循环一致记忆状态的局部推理算子。

Result: MAI提供了Mountcastle通用皮层算法的原理基础，建立了MAI与强化学习之间的时间反转对偶关系：RL从奖励向前传播价值，MAI从记忆向后重建潜在原因。

Conclusion: MAI提供了一个基于结构、重用和记忆的统一生物学基础智能理论，为实现人工通用智能（AGI）提供了深刻启示，并解决了现代AI面临的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

probabilistic version of the Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data
Description (TGN-SVDD) model, designed to enhance detection accuracy in the

significant improvements in detection performance compared to the baseline

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型假设概念条件独立，忽略了概念间的隐藏关系，而实际概念往往相互关联

Method: 提出GraphCBMs，构建潜在概念图来表示概念间的关系，与概念瓶颈模型结合使用

Result: 在真实图像分类任务中表现优异，提供更好的概念结构信息，支持更有效的干预，且在不同训练和架构设置下性能稳健

Conclusion: GraphCBMs通过建模概念间关系显著提升了概念瓶颈模型的性能和可解释性，为概念干预提供了更有效的框架

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

TL;DR: 提出了ABMLL方法，一种基于摊销贝叶斯元学习的LoRA微调技术，在保持计算效率的同时提升大语言模型的泛化能力和不确定性量化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如上下文提示优化和元学习虽然能改善泛化，但内存和计算成本高昂，需要长上下文提示或二阶梯度更新

Method: 基于摊销贝叶斯元学习框架，重新定义LoRA中的任务特定参数和全局参数，使用新超参数平衡重构精度和参数保真度

Result: 在Unified-QA和CrossFit数据集上测试，ABMLL在准确率和预期校准误差方面均优于现有方法，可扩展到Llama3-8B等大模型

Conclusion: ABMLL为LLM微调提供了一种计算高效的方法，既能提升泛化性能，又能提供更好的不确定性量化

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

Motivation: 在边缘设备部署LLM需要动态剪枝来减少计算量，但现有静态方法灵活性差，预测器方法增加开销，零剪枝方法在短提示/长生成场景表现不佳。

Method: 提出A/I-GLASS方法：基于激活和影响的全局-局部重要性聚合，使用排名聚合结合提示局部统计和模型固有全局统计，动态选择FFN单元。

Result: 在多个LLM和基准测试中，GLASS显著优于现有无需训练的方法，特别是在挑战性的长文本生成场景，且不增加推理开销。

Conclusion: GLASS提供了一种高效的无训练动态剪枝方案，通过全局-局部统计聚合解决了现有方法的局限性，为边缘部署LLM提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法存在两个分离范式：强化学习方法不稳定且样本效率低；搜索方法需要昂贵的人工标注且容易受分布偏移影响。需要一种统一的解决方案。

Method: 结合对抗逆强化学习(AIRL)和组相对策略优化(GRPO)，直接从正确推理轨迹学习密集动态过程奖励模型，无需标注中间过程数据。

Result: 在8个基准测试(数学、科学推理、代码生成)上平均性能提升9%，达到GPT-4o水平。集成到搜索算法中始终优于所有基于标注数据训练的基线PRM。

Conclusion: RL训练的奖励函数本身就是搜索的最佳过程奖励模型，为LLM复杂推理任务提供了鲁棒且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow
convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques
have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to
ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the
simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,
highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

Method: 将传统学习理论扩展到GNNs背景，通过谱图理论分析SGD和Ridge回归的过度风险曲线，比较不同图结构（规则图vs幂律图）的影响，并扩展到多层线性GNNs

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合流匹配和检测模型，有效解决了偷猎预测中的数据不完整和稀缺问题，为保护干预措施提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Organ-Agents是一个可信、可解释且可推广的数字孪生系统，适用于精准诊断、治疗策略模拟和重症监护假设测试。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

Motivation: 基于分数的图生成模型在药物发现和蛋白质合成等关键应用中表现有效，但其理论行为特别是收敛性研究不足。与单随机微分方程控制的普通分数生成模型不同，SGGMs涉及耦合的随机微分方程组，现有收敛分析不适用。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对SGGMs的理论理解，证明了其在关键领域的适用性，并为设计有效模型提供了实用的超参数选择和归一化技术指导。

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图扩散生成模型(GDGMs)面临内存需求高、难以扩展到大型图，以及尺寸泛化能力差的问题，限制了其在实际大规模图数据中的应用。

Method: 提出随机块图扩散(SBGD)模型，将图表示细化到块图空间，融入基于真实图模式的结构先验，显著降低内存复杂度并改善尺寸泛化。

Result: SBGD实现了显著的内存改进(最高6倍)，同时保持或超越了最先进方法的图生成性能，并能更好地泛化到未见过的图尺寸。

Conclusion: SBGD不仅是一个可扩展且有效的GDGM，还展示了生成建模中的模块化原则，为通过分解复杂任务来探索生成模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

Method: 通过贝叶斯学习迭代修正模型猜想，将推测模型量化为有限马尔可夫模型，利用动态规划进行在线响应规划。

Conclusion: MOBAL方法有效解决了模型不准确情况下的网络事件响应问题，证明了贝叶斯学习的渐近一致性，并为模型错误和量化误差提供了理论界限。

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在二次时间内计算FANOVA高斯过程模型精确Shapley值的方法，解决了传统方法计算复杂度高的问题，为概率模型提供了可扩展且包含不确定性的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley值作为特征重要性归因的 principled 方法，在计算上存在指数级复杂度问题，特别是在概率模型（如高斯过程）中，由于输出是随机变量而非点估计，需要额外的计算努力来建模高阶矩，这严重限制了其实际应用。

Method: 针对FANOVA GP这一重要类别的高斯过程，论文定义了基于函数组件的随机合作游戏来计算精确的随机Shapley值，并引入了基于方差的确定性值函数。利用FANOVA分解的闭式随机Möbius表示，并采用受牛顿恒等式启发的递归算法来高效计算Shapley值的均值和方差。

Result: 实现了在二次时间内计算局部和全局解释的精确Shapley归因，能够同时捕捉期望贡献和不确定性，量化每个特征对模型整体敏感性的贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了可解释AI的实用性，通过为结构化概率模型提供更可扩展、公理上合理且包含不确定性感知的解释，实证研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战扩散模型需要大量隐状态的传统假设，探索减少隐状态数量同时保持生成质量的可能性，以提高训练效率和收敛速度

Method: 通过精心选择噪声调度方案，将扩散模型从传统的多隐状态训练压缩到少量隐状态（T~32），并进一步实现单隐状态的完全解耦，通过组合多个独立训练的单隐状态模型来生成高质量样本

Result: 实验表明，解耦模型在多个指标上实现了4-6倍的收敛速度提升，在保持生成质量的同时显著提高了训练效率

Conclusion: 扩散模型并不需要大量隐状态，通过适当的噪声调度和模型解耦技术，可以大幅减少隐状态数量并获得更快的收敛速度，这为扩散模型的高效训练提供了新的思路

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

Conclusion: 切比雪夫多项式基在深度强化学习中具有潜力，但多项式度数的选择是关键超参数，需要在模型复杂度之间权衡

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中验证奖励(RLVR)对昂贵标注的依赖以及仅限于可验证任务的限制，同时突破传统双重学习仅限于严格对偶任务对(如翻译和回译)的约束。

Method: 将原始任务输入分解为已知和未知组件，构建对偶任务利用原始输出和已知信息重建未知部分，重建质量作为自监督奖励来优化原始任务，利用LLM通过单一模型实例化两个任务的能力。

Conclusion: DuPO作为一个可扩展、通用且无需标注的LLM优化范式，在各种任务上取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Method: 提出两种算法：1) 保守算法α_max：基于预测输出长度上限进行调度，防止内存溢出；2) 适应算法α_min：初始使用预测下限，在推理过程中动态精化估计。证明了α_min达到对数级竞争比。

Result: 数值模拟显示，α_min算法表现几乎与后见调度器相当，显示出高效和稳健性。这种设计只需依赖预测区间的下限，而上限预测通常更难准确。

Conclusion: 通过机器学习预测输出长度的下限范围，α_min算法能够在不确定性条件下实现高效的LLM推理调度，显著降低延迟和能耗，且更容易实现。

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归基准测试过度强调恢复特定表达式形式，依赖计算机代数系统评估成功，且在发现表达式后仍继续搜索，存在效率问题

Method: 使用SRSD基准问题，引入精心策划的可接受表达式列表和回调机制实现早期终止，对SymbolicRegression.jl和TiSR两个包进行基准测试

Result: SymbolicRegression.jl的重新发现率从26.7%提升到44.7%，计算开销减少41.2%；TiSR的重新发现率为69.4%，时间节省63%

Conclusion: 新的基准测试方法通过更灵活的表达式评估和早期终止机制，显著提高了符号回归算法的测试效率和重新发现率

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于反事实生成的动态基线选择方法，用于医学图像的可解释性分析，解决了传统固定基线在医学场景中的语义缺失问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学领域的可解释性至关重要，但现有路径归因方法依赖的基线输入（如全零输入）在医学上下文中往往缺乏语义意义，因为医学数据中的缺失本身可能包含重要信息

Method: 使用变分自编码器生成反事实基线，提出临床正常但接近输入的反事实表示作为特征缺失的准确表征。该方法与生成模型无关，可适用于任何合适的反事实方法

Result: 在三个不同的医学数据集上评估，实证表明反事实基线相比标准基线选择能产生更忠实和医学相关的归因结果

Conclusion: 反事实引导的基线选择方法为医学数据解释提供了更准确的特征缺失表示，显著提升了归因结果的临床相关性和可信度

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Energy框架，通过直接使用倒数第二层logits和玻尔兹曼能量分布，改进LLM幻觉检测和不确定性估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义熵方法依赖softmax后概率，无法捕捉模型内在不确定性，在某些场景下效果不佳

Method: 结合语义聚类和玻尔兹曼能量分布，直接在倒数第二层logits上操作，利用LLM的固有置信度

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升幻觉检测和不确定性估计性能

Conclusion: Semantic Energy为下游应用提供更可靠的幻觉检测信号，优于传统语义熵方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Conclusion: ELATE有效解决了时间序列特征工程自动化问题，通过结合进化框架和语言模型实现了性能显著提升

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

Method: 开发了AFABench基准框架，包含合成和真实数据集，支持多种获取策略（静态、贪婪、强化学习等），采用模块化设计便于新方法集成。特别设计了AFAContext合成数据集来测试策略的前瞻能力。

Result: 实现了所有主要类别代表性算法的评估，揭示了不同AFA策略之间的关键权衡，为贪婪选择策略的局限性提供了实证证据，并提供了对未来研究有指导意义的见解。

Conclusion: AFABench为AFA研究提供了首个标准化评估平台，通过系统性比较揭示了不同策略的优缺点，推动了该领域的方法发展和实际应用，代码已开源供研究社区使用。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SMILES扩散模型仅支持单模态约束，需要为每种新约束重新训练模型。现实应用中常需要跨模态多约束，且约束条件可能随时间变化，因此需要能够灵活扩展预训练模型的方法。

Method: 基于预训练扩散模型，添加两个可训练模块：结构控制模块(SCM)和性质控制模块(PCM)。生成过程分两阶段：第一阶段使用SCM在早期扩散步骤中注入结构约束，第二阶段使用PCM在后期推理中引导化学性质匹配。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了该方法的效率和适应性，CMCM-DLM在药物发现应用中展现出显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了跨模态约束的分子生成问题，无需重新训练即可灵活扩展新约束，为药物发现提供了有效的分子生成解决方案。

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

Conclusion: 周期漂移是跨设备联邦学习中的重要问题，FedEve框架能有效解决周期漂移和客户端漂移的交互影响，提升非IID数据下的性能

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

Conclusion: 动态拓扑和智能客户端选择可以显著提升分布式SGD算法的性能，该统一框架为这类算法提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

Conclusion: DualNILM有效解决了表后能源对NILM的挑战，通过多任务学习框架实现了准确的电器状态识别和能量注入识别，为智能家居能耗监测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

### [163] [Measuring IIA Violations in Similarity Choices with Bayesian Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14615)
*Hugo Sales Corrêa,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种统计方法来检验相似性选择中的无关选项独立性(IIA)假设，发现了显著的IIA违反现象，并表明这些违反是由选择集内的情境效应驱动的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似性选择数据在信息检索和嵌入学习等场景中很常见，但传统基于度量的模型假设IIA属性。虽然IIA违反已在许多离散选择设置中被发现，但相似性选择设置却很少受到关注，因为目标依赖性质使得IIA测试变得复杂。

Method: 提出了两种统计测试方法：经典拟合优度测试和基于后验预测检查(PPC)的贝叶斯方法。贝叶斯方法能够量化IIA违反的程度而不仅仅是显著性。还设计了新的PPC测试来检验群体同质性。

Result: 在两个数据集上都确认了显著的IIA违反，发现随机生成的选择集和专门设计的选择集具有可比程度的违反。群体同质性测试表明群体确实是同质的，说明IIA违反是由选择集内的情境效应驱动的。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要开发新的相似性选择模型来考虑此类情境效应，因为传统的IIA假设在相似性选择设置中不成立。

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个模糊增强可解释AI框架(FEXAI)，结合模糊逻辑、机器学习和SHAP分析，用于识别影响连续下降操作(CDO)性能的关键因素，并生成可解释的模糊规则，分类准确率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续下降操作(CDO)具有减少燃油消耗、排放和噪音等优势，但现有研究缺乏对CDO性能影响因素的系统分析，且相关方法缺乏航空领域所需的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 收集1094个航班的ADS-B数据，包含29个特征(11个操作特征和18个天气特征)。应用机器学习模型和SHAP分析分类CDO依从水平并排序特征重要性，使用最重要的三个特征构建模糊规则分类器。

Result: 所有模型分类准确率超过90%，识别出平均下降速率、下降段数量和平均航向变化是CDO性能的最强预测因子。FEXAI能够生成有意义、人类可读的操作规则。

Conclusion: FEXAI方法为操作决策支持提供了新途径，可集成到航空工具中实现实时建议，在各种操作条件下保持CDO依从性。

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过将SNOMED医学术语层次结构映射到双曲空间，生成Poincaré嵌入，并将其整合到深度学习模型中，以改进肺癌发病预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床预测模型通常忽略临床概念间的语义关系，本研究旨在通过整合领域特定的语义信息来改善肺癌预测。

Method: 从SNOMED分类法构建临床知识图谱，通过黎曼随机梯度下降生成Poincaré嵌入，并将其整合到ResNet和Transformer深度学习架构中。

Result: 使用预训练Poincaré嵌入相比随机初始化欧几里得嵌入的基线模型，在区分性能上有适度且一致的改进。ResNet模型（特别是10维Poincaré嵌入）显示出更好的校准性能。

Conclusion: 将临床知识图谱嵌入双曲空间并整合到深度学习模型中，可以通过保留临床术语的层次结构来改善肺癌预测，展示了数据驱动特征提取与临床知识结合的有效方法。

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

Motivation: 现有数据影响力分析工具精度不足，往往需要假设神经网络损失函数是凸的，这些限制使得现有方法难以有效实施

Method: 提出Diff-In方法，将样本影响力表述为连续训练迭代中变化/差异的累积和。使用二阶近似来高精度逼近这些差异项，同时消除现有方法所需的模型凸性要求。通过计算Hessian矩阵和梯度的乘积来保持计算效率

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，Diff-In相比现有影响力估计器具有显著更低的近似误差。在多个基准数据集上的三个数据中心任务（数据清理、数据删除、核心集选择）中表现出优越性能，能够扩展到百万级数据点

Conclusion: Diff-In提供了一种高效准确的数据影响力估计方法，解决了现有工具在精度和实用性方面的局限性，为数据驱动的AI应用提供了更好的分析工具

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络公平性方法通过过滤敏感信息（如边删除或特征掩码）可能无意中消除非敏感特征，导致预测准确性和公平性之间的平衡受损

Method: 使用反事实数据增强创建多样化邻居环境，在消息传递前生成增强图，然后使用对抗判别器来减少传统GNN分类器的预测偏差

Result: 在标准数据集上使用三种GNN骨干网络的实验表明，Fair-ICD显著提高了公平性指标，同时保持了较高的预测性能

Conclusion: Fair-ICD方法在适度条件下确保了图神经网络的公平性，为解决GNN中的偏见问题提供了一种有效的新途径

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验证明了所提方法的有效性

Conclusion: CES2-GAD方法通过谱分析和因果边分离有效解决了异质图中的异常检测问题，异常节点的异质性导致谱能量从低频向高频转移

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating

Motivation: 传统扩散模型使用各向同性高斯噪声，忽略了数据的结构信息。受量子压缩态根据海森堡不确定性原理重新分布不确定性的启发，作者希望通过数据依赖的噪声缩放来帮助模型更好地学习重要数据特征。

Method: 提出了两种配置：(1)海森堡扩散模型，在主轴上缩放噪声并在正交方向上进行逆缩放；(2)标准SDM变体，仅缩放主轴方向。在CIFAR-10/100和CelebA-64数据集上进行实验。

Conclusion: 简单的数据感知噪声整形可以在不改变架构的情况下带来稳健的生成性能提升，证明了数据依赖噪声缩放的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

Conclusion: HERAKLES框架通过动态编译技能和利用LLM的泛化能力，为开放环境中的分层自目标学习提供了有效的解决方案，能够处理不断增长的目标复杂性。

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

Conclusion: EdgeFD方法提高了联邦蒸馏的可扩展性和实际应用性，特别适合资源受限的边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

Motivation: 基于压缩的距离度量方法虽然灵活且领域无关，但因其相似性特征是从数据中自动推导而非预先定义，往往难以与具体任务对齐，特别是在复杂的聚类或分类场景中。

Method: 提出"上下文导向"方法，通过系统分析每个对象在聚类框架内如何影响关系上下文，主动引导特征塑造过程，生成定制化的嵌入空间来分离和放大类别区分信息。使用NCD和NRC距离度量结合层次聚类进行验证。

Conclusion: 该方法标志着应用方式的根本转变：从仅仅发现内在数据结构转向主动塑造针对特定目标定制的特征空间。

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM)框架，通过直接修改源分布而非概率流向量场来实现生成模型引导，保持预训练向量场不变，将引导问题转化为源分布采样问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型引导方法通过修改概率流向量场来实现，但这种方法可能破坏预训练模型的性能。本文旨在开发一种更灵活、理论保证更强的引导框架。

Method: SGFM框架保持预训练向量场不变，直接修改源分布，将引导问题转化为从源分布采样的定义明确的问题。支持用户根据具体问题灵活选择采样方法。

Result: 理论证明SGFM能精确恢复目标分布，提供了使用近似采样器和近似向量场时的Wasserstein误差界限。在合成2D基准、图像数据集和物理信息生成任务上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: SGFM框架提供了理论保证的灵活引导方法，与最优流匹配模型良好集成，保持了向量场生成的直线传输映射，在多种任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的链接预测方法存在两个主要问题：缺乏理论分析支持，以及对节点度考虑不足。本文旨在填补这些研究空白。

Method: 1) 首次提供链接预测中对比学习的正式理论分析；2) 提出EBA图增强方法调整节点度；3) 开发CoEBA框架整合EBA和新对比损失函数。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验表明，CoEBA方法显著优于其他最先进的链接预测模型。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析和创新的图增强技术，成功提升了对比学习在链接预测任务中的性能，为相关研究提供了新的理论基础和实践框架。

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用潜在Kronecker高斯过程预测学习曲线来指导Successive Halving算法，以避免过早剪枝慢启动但最终表现优秀的候选参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Successive Halving算法依赖中间性能值做资源分配决策，容易过早剪枝那些启动慢但最终会成为最佳候选的参数配置。

Method: 使用潜在Kronecker高斯过程预测学习曲线，基于预测结果指导Successive Halving算法的资源分配决策。

Result: 预测方法能达到竞争性性能，但相比在标准方法上投入更多资源，它并非帕累托最优，因为需要完全观测的学习曲线作为训练数据。

Conclusion: 虽然预测方法有潜力，但需要完全观测的学习曲线数据限制了其效果，不过可以利用现有的学习曲线数据来缓解这一缺点。

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Motivation: 研究如何在不访问训练数据的情况下，仅使用预训练模型的最终权重来合成单一神经网络，探索神经平均的正式定义和方法。

Method: 提出AME框架，将模型差异视为伪梯度来指导神经权重更新，实现数据自由的模型集成策略，比传统的模型融合方法更具表达性和适应性。

Result: AME产生的平均神经解决方案在分布外设置中优于单个专家模型和模型融合基线，特别是在泛化性能方面表现突出。

Conclusion: AME提供了一个原则性和可推广的数据自由模型权重聚合方法，为神经平均操作提供了正式的定义和实现途径。

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

Motivation: 现有越狱方法要么依赖离散标记空间的低效搜索，要么优化连续嵌入但无法直接应用于专有模型，投影回离散标记会降低攻击效果

Method: 使用指数梯度下降和Bregman投影优化松弛one-hot编码，确保每个标记的one-hot编码始终保持在概率单纯形内

Result: 在5个开源LLM和4个对抗行为数据集上评估，相比3个SOTA基线方法获得更高成功率和更快收敛速度，并能生成跨多个提示的通用对抗后缀

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM安全对齐提供了有效的越狱测试手段，证明了理论收敛性并实现了高效的越狱攻击算法

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型规模增大和训练成本增加，需要在有限计算预算下最大化性能。虽然语言模型的计算优化缩放已有研究，但强化学习领域在这方面关注较少，特别是基于价值的在线深度强化学习方法。

Method: 研究在线、基于价值的深度强化学习方法，分析模型容量和更新数据比(UTD)两个计算分配维度。通过实验探索不同模型大小、批大小和UTD比之间的相互作用。

Result: 发现了TD过拟合现象：小模型增加批大小会快速损害Q函数准确性，但大模型没有这种效应，使得在大规模时能有效使用大批大小。建立了理解这种现象的心智模型。

Conclusion: 提出了选择批大小和UTD比的计算优化指南，为深度强化学习中的计算最优缩放提供了理论基础，类似于监督学习中的研究但适应了TD学习的特点。

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

Motivation: 传统检索方法在金融领域检索精度不足，需要同时捕获语义相似性和进行细粒度推理。虽然LLM为多步推理检索提供了新机会，但金融领域缺乏相应的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含3,429个专家标注样本的基准测试，将检索过程分为两个推理步骤：识别最相关文档类型和在选定文档中定位关键段落，以解决上下文限制问题。

Result: 评估了多个最先进模型，并证明针对性微调可以显著提升代理检索性能。

Conclusion: 该基准为研究复杂金融领域特定任务中检索导向的LLM行为提供了基础，未来计划扩展到整个S&P 500及更多公司。

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain,
where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of
documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in
retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but
also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and
domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the
model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is
most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate
such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce
FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with
multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The
benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms
and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document
type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected
document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning
steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a
quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.
We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how
targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.
Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior
in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset
publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for
the full S&P 500 and beyond.

Abstract: The explosive growth of the video game industry has created an urgent need
for recommendation systems that can scale with expanding catalogs and maintain
user engagement. While prior work has explored accuracy and diversity in
recommendations, existing models underutilize playtime, a rich behavioral
signal unique to gaming platforms, and overlook the potential of multimodal
information to enhance diversity. In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel
Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize
accuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest
intensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via
dual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate
recommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks
module that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both
playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This
mechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery
through latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive
experiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing
methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

Method: 设计GPT-2预处理管道，将领域特定文件转换为适合gzip压缩的格式，预处理后再用gzip进行常规压缩

Conclusion: GPT-based预处理方法能有效提升领域特定结构化数据的压缩效率，解决了传统压缩算法在处理语义重复但语法不重复数据时的局限性

Abstract: In the modern era, large volumes of data are being produced continuously,
especially in domain-specific fields such as medical records and clinical
files, defence logs and HTML-based web traffic. Data with such volume and
complexity needs to be compressed before storing and transmitting efficiently.
Data compression has gained significant attention from modern researchers,
resulting in the development of fast and efficient compression algorithms such
as Gzip. However, since gzip works on the principle of repetition of binary
patterns, one of the limitations of gzip is that domain-specific formats like
JSON, XML, HTML, and log files, while structured, may have semantic repetition
but not syntactic repetition, which gzip finds difficult to compress. In this
article, we propose a GPT-based preprocessor for such domain-specific files. We
propose a pipeline made up of GPT-2 taking domain-specific files as input,
which pattern-based compressors like gzip find difficult to work on. The
preprocessor results are output in a file that is designed for compressors like
gzip. After preprocessing, the gzip works on the other end of the pipeline and
compresses the data as usual. We used different types of both real-world and
synthetically generated data, such as logs and HTML files, for the experiment
of the proposed model. We found promising results and an improvement of the
Defence logs by 0.34 per cent and HTML files by 5.8 per cent.

Method: 使用305个以色列神经学认证考试问题构建基准测试，按三个复杂度维度分类。评估了10个LLM的基础模型、RAG方法和新颖的多智能体系统，后者将神经学推理分解为专门认知功能

Result: OpenAI-o1基础模型表现最佳（90.9%准确率），专业医学模型表现较差（Meditron-70B仅52.9%）。RAG效果有限，而多智能体框架使LLaMA 3.3-70B从69.5%提升至89.2%准确率，在复杂问题上表现显著改善

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体方法能显著增强复杂医学推理能力，模拟专门认知过程，为AI在挑战性临床环境中的应用提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their
ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic
evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from
Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three
complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration,
and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results
showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base
performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly
(52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited
effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent
framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive
functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis,
and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range
models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus
69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity
questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty
performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning
challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using
an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm
that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized
cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering
promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.

Abstract: In daily fantasy sports, players enter into "contests" where they compete
against each other by building teams of athletes that score fantasy points
based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports
match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial
variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize
pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest
personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper
presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep
Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our
company, one of the large fantasy sports platforms with millions of daily
contests and millions of players, where online experiments show a marked
improvement over other candidate models in terms of recall and other critical
business metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RAG技术在AI领域得到广泛关注并开始业界采用，但关于其在实际产业环境中应用的研究仍很缺乏。研究者希望通过对业界实践者的访谈来填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用半结构化访谈研究方法，访谈了13位来自业界的RAG技术实践者，从以下四个方面进行分析：业界应用案例、系统需求、实践挑战与经验教训、以及行业评估方法。

Result: 主要发现包括：当前RAG应用主要限于领域特定问答任务，系统多处于原型阶段；业界要求优先考虑数据保护、安全性和质量，而豪道、偏见和扩展性问题关注度较低；数据预处理仍是关键挑战，系统评估主要依靠人工而非自动化方法。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了RAG技术在产业实践中的真实状况，指出当前应用仍处于初级阶段，需要更多关注数据预处理、系统评估方法以及豪道偏见等问题。这为业界实践者和研究人员提供了有价值的实践见解和发展方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a well-established and rapidly
evolving field within AI that enhances the outputs of large language models by
integrating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources.
While industry adoption of RAG is now beginning, there is a significant lack of
research on its practical application in industrial contexts. To address this
gap, we conducted a semistructured interview study with 13 industry
practitioners to explore the current state of RAG adoption in real-world
settings. Our study investigates how companies apply RAG in practice, providing
(1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system
requirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical
experiences, and (4) an analysis of current industry evaluation methods. Our
main findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to
domain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry
requirements focus primarily on data protection, security, and quality, while
issues such as ethics, bias, and scalability receive less attention; data
preprocessing remains a key challenge, and system evaluation is predominantly
conducted by humans rather than automated methods.

TL;DR: RewardRank是一个通过反事实奖励学习建模用户行为的排名框架，使用深度效用模型预测用户参与度，并通过可微分软排列操作优化排名策略，在多个大规模基准测试中优于现有基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统排名系统依赖简化的用户行为假设，无法捕捉真实世界中复杂的行为偏差（如位置偏差、品牌亲和力、诱饵效应等），导致模型与用户实际效用不匹配

Method: 提出RewardRank框架：1）训练深度效用模型估计整个项目排列的用户参与度；2）通过可微分软排列操作优化排名策略以最大化预测效用；3）引入两种自动评估协议KD-Eval和LLM-Eval来处理未见排列的评估挑战

Result: 在Baidu-ULTR和Amazon KDD Cup等大规模基准测试中，该方法 consistently outperforms强基线方法

Conclusion: 建模用户行为动态对于效用优化的排名系统是有效的，RewardRank框架能够更好地捕捉真实用户行为并提升排名性能

Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume
simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are
sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are
influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand
affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail
to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with
actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across
the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling
user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,
first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item
permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize
predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling
end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To
address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen
permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$,
using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)
$\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language
models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the
Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior
dynamics for utility-optimized ranking. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: YOLOR是一个单阶段重排序方法，通过移除传统两阶段方法中的通用搜索单元(GSU)，仅保留精确搜索单元(ESU)，解决了不一致性问题，同时实现了列表级效果和排列级效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段重排序方法存在严重的不一致性问题，即GSU经常错过ESU中的高价值列表，需要在效果和效率之间做出权衡。

Method: 提出YOLOR单阶段重排序方法，包含：(1)基于树的情境提取模块(TCEM)分层聚合多尺度情境特征实现列表级效果；(2)情境缓存模块(CCM)实现候选排列间特征高效重用实现排列级效率。

Result: 在公共和工业数据集上的广泛实验验证了YOLOR的性能，并已成功部署在美团外卖平台上。

Conclusion: YOLOR通过创新的单阶段架构有效解决了重排序中的不一致性问题，在保持高效率的同时实现了更好的推荐效果。

Abstract: Reranking plays a crucial role in modern recommender systems by capturing the
mutual influences within the list. Due to the inherent challenges of
combinatorial search spaces, most methods adopt a two-stage search paradigm: a
simple General Search Unit (GSU) efficiently reduces the candidate space, and
an Exact Search Unit (ESU) effectively selects the optimal sequence. These
methods essentially involve making trade-offs between effectiveness and
efficiency, while suffering from a severe \textbf{inconsistency problem}, that
is, the GSU often misses high-value lists from ESU. To address this problem, we
propose YOLOR, a one-stage reranking method that removes the GSU while
retaining only the ESU. Specifically, YOLOR includes: (1) a Tree-based Context
Extraction Module (TCEM) that hierarchically aggregates multi-scale contextual
features to achieve "list-level effectiveness", and (2) a Context Cache Module
(CCM) that enables efficient feature reuse across candidate permutations to
achieve "permutation-level efficiency". Extensive experiments across public and
industry datasets validate YOLOR's performance, and we have successfully
deployed YOLOR on the Meituan food delivery platform.

TL;DR: 提出DivNS方法，通过多样性负采样提升推荐系统性能，结合硬负样本和多样性负样本生成更有效的训练数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负采样方法倾向于从密集区域采样，导致负样本同质化，限制了模型的表达能力和泛化能力

Method: DivNS方法包含三个步骤：1) 构建用户特定缓存存储高信息量负样本；2) 多样性增强采样器从缓存中选择多样化负样本；3) 合成负样本生成器结合硬负样本和多样性负样本

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，DivNS能显著提升推荐质量，同时保持计算效率

Conclusion: DivNS通过引入多样性负采样机制，能够学习更广泛的物品空间，提高推荐系统的泛化能力

Abstract: Implicit collaborative filtering recommenders are usually trained to learn
user positive preferences. Negative sampling, which selects informative
negative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this
process. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative
sampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions.
This leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In
this paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that
explicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative
sampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference
scores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly
informative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a
diverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity
from the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator
combines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more
effective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative
and diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve
their generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality
while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 传统基于ID的推荐方法存在数据稀疏性问题，现有多模态推荐方法主要采用早期融合方式，忽略了用户行为序列的上下文影响，无法动态适应用户的多模态兴趣表示

Method: 提出分布引导的多模态兴趣自编码器(DMAE)，在行为级别实现用户多模态兴趣的跨模态融合

Result: 大量实验证明了DMAE的优越性

Conclusion: DMAE通过行为级别的跨模态融合有效解决了多模态推荐中的动态兴趣表示问题，提升了推荐准确性

Abstract: Traditional recommendation methods rely on correlating the embedding vectors
of item IDs to capture implicit collaborative filtering signals to model the
user's interest in the target item. Consequently, traditional ID-based methods
often encounter data sparsity problems stemming from the sparse nature of ID
features. To alleviate the problem of item ID sparsity, recommendation models
incorporate multimodal item information to enhance recommendation accuracy.
However, existing multimodal recommendation methods typically employ early
fusion approaches, which focus primarily on combining text and image features,
while neglecting the contextual influence of user behavior sequences. This
oversight prevents dynamic adaptation of multimodal interest representations
based on behavioral patterns, consequently restricting the model's capacity to
effectively capture user multimodal interests. Therefore, this paper proposes
the Distribution-Guided Multimodal-Interest Auto-Encoder (DMAE), which achieves
the cross fusion of user multimodal interest at the behavioral
level.Ultimately, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DMAE.

Motivation: 当前多场景推荐方法使用共享底层表示，无法充分捕捉场景独特性，且跨场景数据稀疏阻碍了场景特定表示的学习

Result: 大量实验证实GSVR能有效帮助现有多场景推荐方法学习更鲁棒的表示

Conclusion: GSVR框架能够缓解稀疏场景中的数据稀疏问题，提升多场景推荐性能

Abstract: With the emergence of e-commerce, the recommendations provided by commercial
platforms must adapt to diverse scenarios to accommodate users' varying
shopping preferences. Current methods typically use a unified framework to
offer personalized recommendations for different scenarios. However, they often
employ shared bottom representations, which partially hinders the model's
capacity to capture scenario uniqueness. Ideally, users and items should
exhibit specific characteristics in different scenarios, prompting the need to
learn scenario-specific representations to differentiate scenarios. Yet,
variations in user and item interactions across scenarios lead to data sparsity
issues, impeding the acquisition of scenario-specific representations. To learn
robust scenario-specific representations, we introduce a Global-Distribution
Aware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework (GSVR)
that can be directly applied to existing multi-scenario methods. Specifically,
considering the uncertainty stemming from limited samples, our approach employs
a probabilistic model to generate scenario-specific distributions for each user
and item in each scenario, estimated through variational inference (VI).
Additionally, we introduce the global knowledge-aware multinomial distributions
as prior knowledge to regulate the learning of the posterior user and item
distributions, ensuring similarities among distributions for users with akin
interests and items with similar side information. This mitigates the risk of
users or items with fewer records being overwhelmed in sparse scenarios.
Extensive experimental results affirm the efficacy of GSVR in assisting
existing multi-scenario recommendation methods in learning more robust
representations.

Motivation: 现有生成式推荐系统主要关注序列生成，不适合CTR预测任务。CTR模型严重依赖目标物品与用户之间的交叉特征，丢弃这些特征会显著损害性能。需要利用生成模型理解数据分布的能力来缓解传统判别模型在标签稀缺空间的约束

Result: 通过大量离线实验和在线A/B测试验证了框架的有效性

Conclusion: DGenCTR框架成功将生成模型应用于CTR预测任务，解决了传统方法的标签稀缺问题，并通过实验证明了其优越性能

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have inspired the field of recommender
systems to explore generative approaches, but most existing research focuses on
sequence generation, a paradigm ill-suited for click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. CTR models critically depend on a large number of cross-features
between the target item and the user to estimate the probability of clicking on
the item, and discarding these cross-features will significantly impair model
performance. Therefore, to harness the ability of generative models to
understand data distributions and thereby alleviate the constraints of
traditional discriminative models in label-scarce space, diverging from the
item-generation paradigm of sequence generation methods, we propose a novel
sample-level generation paradigm specifically designed for the CTR task: a
two-stage Discrete Diffusion-Based Generative CTR training framework (DGenCTR).
This two-stage framework comprises a diffusion-based generative pre-training
stage and a CTR-targeted supervised fine-tuning stage for CTR. Finally,
extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing conclusively validate the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage
paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent
research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising
way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand,
lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling
methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and
candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to
utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the
other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information,
potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these
problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal
information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based
retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong
Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal
lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we
propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding
to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user
interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search
unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for
multi-perspective interests searching.

Method: 设计OneLoc模型，包括：1)地理感知语义ID编码视频和地理信息；2)地理感知自注意力机制；3)邻居感知提示获取上下文信息。使用强化学习和两种奖励函数来平衡多目标

Result: 模型已部署在快手App中，每日服务400万活跃用户，在GMV和订单数量上分别实现了21.016%和17.891%的提升

Conclusion: OneLoc通过创新的地理信息利用方法和多目标平衡技术，成功解决了本地生活服务场景中的生成式推荐挑战，并取得了显著的商业成果

Abstract: Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video
recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus,
recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into
account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of
such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a
new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search
scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,
an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as
there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make
full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance
multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and
stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we
propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different
perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic
information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder
leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)
neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for
generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and
propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the
above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In
fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves
400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in
terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.

Conclusion: 同时利用正负反馈信号可以显著提升序列推荐系统的性能，负反馈提供了有价值的信号来更准确地识别用户兴趣模式。

Abstract: We consider the task of learning from both positive and negative feedback in
a sequential recommendation scenario, as both types of feedback are often
present in user interactions. Meanwhile, conventional sequential learning
models usually focus on considering and predicting positive interactions,
ignoring that reducing items with negative feedback in recommendations improves
user satisfaction with the service. Moreover, the negative feedback can
potentially provide a useful signal for more accurate identification of true
user interests. In this work, we propose to train two transformer encoders on
separate positive and negative interaction sequences. We incorporate both types
of feedback into the training objective of the sequential recommender using a
composite loss function that includes positive and negative cross-entropy as
well as a cleverly crafted contrastive term, that helps better modeling
opposing patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in terms
of increasing true-positive metrics compared to state-of-the-art sequential
recommendation methods while reducing the number of wrongly promoted negative
items.
