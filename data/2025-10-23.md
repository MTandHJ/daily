Result: 提供了在遥感数据价值链中应用降维技术的系统性指南，识别了降维算法的应用机会和研究方向。

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

*Ahsan Raza Siyal,Markus Haltmeier,Ruth Steiger,Malik Galijasevic,Elke Ruth Gizewski,Astrid Ellen Grams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARE是一个可变形医学图像配准框架，通过动态调整弹性正则化来平衡稳定性和灵活性，包含折叠预防机制以确保物理真实的变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像配准中忽视了正则化对鲁棒性和解剖学合理性的关键作用，需要一种能动态适应变形场特性的正则化方法。

Method: 提出DARE框架，基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，集成应变和剪切能量项，并包含折叠预防机制来惩罚负变形雅可比区域。

Result: 该方法减轻了非物理伪影如折叠，避免了过度平滑，同时提高了配准精度和解剖学合理性。

Conclusion: DARE通过自适应正则化和折叠预防机制，在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和物理真实性平衡。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

### [3] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的基准标记，能够自然地融入真实环境，通过视觉上微小的修改将任意图像转换为可打印的隐蔽标记，用于6自由度位置追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美学等方面过于显眼，需要一种能够隐蔽地融入环境的追踪标记。

Method: 采用端到端的深度隐写术方法，联合训练编码器网络模块，将任意图像转换为Ninja Codes，并实现检测功能。

Result: 实验证明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能提供可靠的位置追踪，同时成功隐藏在多样环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在需要隐蔽追踪的场景中具有重要价值，可使用普通彩色打印机打印，任何配备RGB摄像头并能运行推理的设备均可检测。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [4] [A Matter of Time: Revealing the Structure of Time in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19559)
*Nidham Tekaya,Manuela Waldner,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大规模视觉语言模型的时间感知能力，提出了TIME10k基准数据集，发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中呈低维非线性流形结构，并开发了从嵌入空间提取显式时间线表示的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型是否能够理解视觉内容的时间定位能力，评估模型对时间信息的感知和推理能力。

Method: 构建TIME10k数据集（包含10,000多张带时间标注的图像），评估37个VLM的时间感知能力，并提出从嵌入空间提取时间线表示的方法。

Result: 发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中呈低维非线性流形结构，提出的时间线方法在时间推理任务中达到竞争性甚至更优的准确率，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型具有时间感知能力，时间信息在嵌入空间中具有结构化特征，提出的时间线表示方法能有效支持时间推理任务。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

### [5] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段视觉语言问答系统，用于自动驾驶中的感知、预测和规划问题，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强显著提升了问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中高级感知、预测和规划问题的视觉语言问答需求，利用预训练视觉语言模型但需要更好的提示工程和上下文增强。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用Qwen2.5-VL-32B模型，结合六摄像头输入、历史时间窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段增强场景元数据和任务特定指令。采用自一致性集成提高可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶问答基准测试中显著优于基线模型：第一阶段使用5帧历史和10样本提示达到65.1%准确率，自一致性提升至66.85%；第二阶段达到67.37%。在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和上下文增强可以大幅提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能，证明了提示工程在自动驾驶应用中的重要性。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [6] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D是一种新型状态空间架构，专门用于纵向医学图像分析，能够有效处理高分辨率图像序列和不规则时间间隔，在乳腺癌风险预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学图像分析面临数据挑战：如何有效建模高分辨率图像序列和不规则时间间隔。现有方法要么压缩空间信息，要么使用计算效率低且不兼容非均匀时间步长的时空模型。

Method: 提出连续时间选择性扫描机制，将真实检查时间差整合到状态转换中，并辅以多尺度3D邻域融合模块来捕获时空关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，验证c-index提高2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分均优于现有的循环、变换器和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型凭借线性复杂度能够高效处理长而复杂的患者筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，并将其与文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征对齐，以改善视频生成的时间一致性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频扩散模型在生成复杂运动时往往缺乏时间一致性和物理合理性，主要原因是模型对自然视频中复杂运动的理解不足。现有方法通过将扩散模型特征与预训练视频编码器特征对齐来解决此问题，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态，限制了对齐效果。

Method: 提出运动中心对齐框架：1）从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，该子空间通过预测真实光流进行优化，确保捕捉真实运动动态；2）将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与这个新子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试以及用户研究中表现出色，显著提升了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识性，同时保持了与文本提示的贴合度。

Conclusion: 通过解耦运动子空间并将其与扩散模型特征对齐，能够有效提升文本到视频生成的时间一致性和物理合理性，为视频生成质量提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [8] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述的评估指标，它使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLMs-as-a-Judge，产生基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。同时提出了DOCENT数据集来验证PoSh的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本的详细图像描述，需要能够检测属性和关系错误以及定位特定文本跨度错误的指标。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，通过LLMs-as-a-Judge方法生成基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。同时创建了DOCENT数据集，包含艺术作品、专家撰写的参考描述和模型生成的描述，并由艺术史学生进行质量评估。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类评估的相关性比最佳开源替代方案提高了0.05 Spearman ρ，对不同类型的图像具有鲁棒性，并且作为奖励函数优于标准监督微调。

Conclusion: PoSh是一个可复制、可解释且优于现有指标的评估方法，同时DOCENT数据集为评估详细图像描述指标和模型性能提供了具有挑战性的新领域。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UniHPR，一个统一的人体姿态表示学习管道，通过新颖的基于奇异值的对比学习损失来对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，在人体姿态估计任务中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态融合和生成应用中，人体姿态表示对于人本应用至关重要，但目前缺乏对不同模态姿态表示之间相关性的系统研究。

Method: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习管道，使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失同时对齐多个数据表示，包括图像、2D和3D人体姿态。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm，同时在Human3.6M数据集上实现姿态检索，检索误差为9.24mm MPJPE。

Conclusion: UniHPR能够有效对齐不同模态的人体姿态表示，在人体姿态估计和姿态检索任务中表现出色，证明了统一表示学习的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。医疗数据的敏感性使得开发准确且保护隐私的AI模型具有挑战性，而联邦学习在非独立同分布数据上的训练会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用联邦近端算法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，并结合改进的U-Net模型集成注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割精度。

Conclusion: FedProx在处理非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集训练精确机器学习模型方面具有巨大潜力，是保护隐私的医学AI应用的有前景方法。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

### [12] [X-Ego: Acquiring Team-Level Tactical Situational Awareness via Cross-Egocentric Contrastive Video Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19150)
*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和跨自我对比学习(CECL)方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，特别关注电子竞技游戏Counter-Strike 2中的团队战术学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解研究主要依赖第三人称视角，忽略了多智能体学习的同步性和自我中心特性。团队战术源于每个玩家的个体视角及其预测、解释和适应队友意图的能力。

Method: 提出跨自我对比学习(CECL)，通过对齐队友的自我中心视觉流来培养团队层面的战术情境意识。使用最先进的视频编码器，在队友-对手位置预测任务上进行评估。

Result: CECL在队友-对手位置预测任务上表现出色，能够从单一第一人称视角有效推断队友和对手的位置。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台，对虚拟和现实领域中的时空推理和人机协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Abstract: We propose FootFormer, a cross-modality approach for jointly predicting human
motion dynamics directly from visual input. On multiple datasets, FootFormer
achieves statistically significantly better or equivalent estimates of foot
pressure distributions, foot contact maps, and center of mass (CoM), as
compared with existing methods that generate one or two of those measures.
Furthermore, FootFormer achieves SOTA performance in estimating
stability-predictive components (CoP, CoM, BoS) used in classic kinesiology
metrics. Code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用六种深度卷积网络对疟疾细胞图像进行分类，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%，证明了深度学习在疟疾自动检测中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疟疾诊断依赖专家手动观察血涂片图像，存在专业知识不足和人为错误风险，需要计算机辅助自动诊断系统来提高准确性和效率。

Method: 应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）从血细胞图像中提取深度特征并进行分类。

Result: 在公开疟疾细胞图像数据集上，残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的方法能够实现疟疾的自动可靠检测，同时最小化人工参与，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

*Fengyuan Sun,Hui Chen,Xinhao Xu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存修剪来增强MLLMs对关键视觉信息的关注，从而减轻幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)中的幻觉问题是一个主要挑战，现有解决方案要么需要额外训练数据，要么在推理时引入外部信息，都会带来额外计算成本。研究发现幻觉与视觉token注意力不足密切相关。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存修剪来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注。该方法无需额外训练，几乎不增加推理成本，且与不同解码策略兼容。

Result: 在多个主流幻觉评估基准上使用四种主流MLLMs进行评估，取得了稳健且出色的结果，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将token修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有训练免费、计算成本低、模型无关等优势，能有效减轻幻觉问题。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

### [16] [Video Consistency Distance: Enhancing Temporal Consistency for Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Based Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19193)
*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时序一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于奖励的微调方法主要关注整体视频质量，但在图像到视频生成任务中时序一致性往往较差，需要专门针对时序一致性的优化方法。

Method: 在视频帧特征频率空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧间信息，并将其集成到基于奖励的微调框架中。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著提升了时序一致性，且不降低其他性能指标。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的时序一致性增强方法，能够在不依赖真实视频数据集的情况下改善视频生成质量。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于增强自动驾驶下游感知任务的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和3D资产渲染生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升角案例感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务的评估。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练周期加倍，当基线方法也加倍训练周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型以生成编辑后的多视角逼真视频，这些视频可用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: Dream4Drive能够以前所未有的灵活性大规模生成多视角角案例，显著提升自动驾驶中的角案例感知能力。实验表明该方法能有效提升下游感知模型在各种训练周期下的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个有效的合成数据生成解决方案，通过3D感知视频编辑技术增强自动驾驶感知系统的性能，特别是对于罕见角案例的处理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MoE-GS框架，将混合专家技术首次引入动态高斯泼溅，通过体积感知像素路由器自适应融合专家输出，提升渲染质量，并通过效率优化和蒸馏策略解决模型容量增加的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，没有单一方法能有效处理所有动态挑战，需要更统一的框架来提升渲染质量和一致性。

Method: 提出MoE-GS框架，集成多个专业专家，通过可微权重泼溅将体积高斯级权重投影到像素空间，实现空间和时间一致的结果。采用单次多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略来优化效率。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的广泛实验表明，MoE-GS在提升效率的同时，持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术融入动态高斯泼溅的方法，通过统一的专家集成框架显著提升了动态场景重建的性能和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/MoE-GS-68BA/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达融合检测网络，通过估计物体二次曲面参数增强空间表示和跨模态交互，预测密集深度用于视角转换和生成伪点云，在TJ4DRadSet和VoD基准上取得优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、长距离检测和精确速度测量的优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示和多模态融合效果。

Method: 通过从图像和雷达数据估计物体二次曲面参数，使用显式表面拟合模型增强空间表示；预测的密集深度用于图像特征从透视视角到BEV的转换，并生成密集伪点云缓解雷达点稀疏问题；采用基于pillar的方法处理点云特征，最后使用标准2D骨干网络和检测头进行预测。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft (VoD)物体检测基准上实现了优越的性能表现。

Conclusion: SFGFusion能够有效融合相机和4D雷达特征，通过表面拟合指导的多模态融合方法显著提升了3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决GEO空间目标检测中的挑战，通过特征增强和时序轨迹优化实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FadeLead是一个协作感知框架，通过将背景上下文信息封装到紧凑的前景特征中，解决带宽限制下的信息传输问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法只传输前景区域特征而丢弃背景，但背景包含重要上下文信息，影响感知性能。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索，逐步剪除背景信息，迫使模型将上下文内化到前景表示中。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 上下文丰富的前景共享方法能有效提升协作感知性能，证明了背景上下文信息的重要性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过语义边缘引导成功解决了单步扩散模型的结构不准确问题，为真实图像超分辨率提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Conclusion: MobiAct实现了低能耗、低计算成本的MAV动作识别，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了效率，适用于资源受限的MAV平台。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在语义对齐方面表现良好，但在生成提示中指定数量的对象时仍存在困难。现有方法只能使用可微的回归模型作为外部批评器，无法利用检测模型更优越的计数能力。

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二元指示器，在推理时使用预训练的T2I模型优化噪声先验。

Result: 在SDXL-Turbo、SD-Turbo和Pixart-DMD等多个模型上，在四个不同复杂度的基准测试中均实现了对象计数准确率的显著提升（如在D2D-Small基准上提升高达13.7%），且图像质量和计算开销下降很小。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功地将检测模型的计数能力整合到文本到图像生成中，显著改善了对象计数性能，同时保持了图像质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled
data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data
privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The

Abstract: Mistake analysis in procedural activities is a critical area of research with
applications spanning industrial automation, physical rehabilitation, education
and human-robot collaboration. This paper reviews vision-based methods for
detecting and predicting mistakes in structured tasks, focusing on procedural
and executional errors. By leveraging advancements in computer vision,
including action recognition, anticipation and activity understanding,

the challenges posed by intra-class variability, viewpoint differences and
compositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection.
Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets,
evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based
on their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning

modeling. This work aims to establish a unified perspective on vision-based
mistake analysis in procedural activities, highlighting its potential to
enhance safety, efficiency and task performance across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 提出统一强化与模仿学习(RIL)算法，通过结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，使小型视觉语言模型能够模仿大型教师模型的文本生成能力并系统性提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)规模庞大，在资源受限环境中不实用，需要开发高效的训练算法来创建轻量级但性能强大的VLMs。

Method: RIL算法结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，使用基于LLM的判别器区分学生和教师输出，并利用多个大型教师VLM提供多样化指导。

Result: 在多种视觉语言基准测试中，RIL显著缩小了与最先进开源和闭源VLMs的性能差距，并在多个实例中超越了它们。

Conclusion: RIL的统一学习策略使小型学生模型能够实现显著的性能提升，使其与领先的闭源VLMs具有竞争力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

*Hai-jie Yuan,Heng Zhang,Fei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于动态签名验证的新方法TS-GATR，结合图注意力网络和门控循环单元来建模签名数据的时空依赖关系，在基准数据集上超越了现有最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写签名验证在身份认证中至关重要，但由于用户内部变异性和伪造风险，实现高精度验证仍然具有挑战性。

Method: TS-GATR将签名表示为图结构，节点捕获动态特征（位置、速度、压力等），使用注意力机制建模复杂关系。采用双图注意力变换器模块分别建模局部和全局空间特征，并集成GRU捕获长期时间依赖。

Result: 在MSDS和DeepSignDB等基准数据集上的实验表明，TS-GATR超越了当前最优方法，在各种场景下持续实现更低的等错误率。

Conclusion: TS-GATR通过有效建模签名数据的时空依赖关系，显著提升了动态签名验证的性能，为身份认证提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过同时预测水深和海底分类，解决了现有方法将这两个任务孤立处理的问题，实现了协同增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的从遥感影像推导水深或海底类别的方法将这两个任务孤立处理，丧失了它们相互作用的互惠益处，阻碍了深度学习方法的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别进行水深估计和像素级海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地会产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需单独的VAE管道即可实现竞争性的图像解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，并添加参数密集的VAE管道来捕获视觉细节，但忽视了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统的功能层次结构，将来自不同视觉区域（低/高级）的fMRI信号对齐到相应的CLIP中间层和最终层，引入交叉重建策略和新的多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超越SOTA方法，包括使用VAE管道的方法，同时参数数量减少71.7%，有效捕获了CLIP-only方法常遗漏的视觉细节。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP通过利用CLIP中间特征，在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡，无需单独的VAE管道，实现了参数高效的高性能图像解码。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的开集词汇图像分割与识别框架，结合EfficientNetB0进行无监督分割和CLIP进行开集词汇目标识别，在多个标准基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要大量标注数据进行训练，限制了在开集词汇场景下的应用。本文旨在开发一个无需训练即可实现高质量图像分割和开集词汇识别的框架。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用EfficientNetB0提取像素特征，通过SVD分解和层次聚类进行无监督分割；2) 利用CLIP的ViT编码分割区域，通过SVD投影增强跨模态对齐，计算图像与文本嵌入的相似度进行识别。

Result: 在COCO、ADE20K和PASCAL VOC等标准基准测试中，在Hungarian mIoU、精确率、召回率和F1分数等指标上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在无需训练的情况下实现高质量图像分割和开集词汇识别的有效性、灵活性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DaMo具有强大的预测能力和泛化性，在不同模型架构上保持有效性，为移动手机代理的多任务学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AegisRF是一种保护NeRF模型知识产权的框架，通过注入对抗性扰动来破坏未经授权的下游应用，同时使用敏感性场来约束几何扰动以保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF成为3D场景表示和视图合成的强大工具，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得越来越重要。现有方法避免几何扰动或将其限制在显式空间中，因为这会严重降低渲染质量。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场（在NeRF预渲染输出中注入对抗性扰动）和敏感性场（学习敏感性来自适应约束几何扰动），在保持渲染质量的同时破坏未经授权使用。

Result: 实验评估表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF成功解决了NeRF知识产权保护问题，通过创新的敏感性学习机制实现了在保持渲染质量的同时有效破坏未经授权应用的目标。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

Motivation: 当前大多数VLM评估集中在单视角设置，而多摄像头设置已成为机器人平台的标准配置，但VLM是否能有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 构建MV-RoboBench基准测试，包含8个子任务的1.7k个QA项目，评估开源和闭源VLM模型，并采用CoT启发技术增强版本。

Result: 最先进模型的性能远低于人类水平，多视角机器人感知面临重大挑战；空间智能与机器人任务执行呈正相关；现有单视角空间理解基准的强性能不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench作为开放资源发布，旨在促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展，提供数据和标准化评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: PICK弥合了MLLMs与专业领域之间的差距，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了结构化且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种多条件生成对抗网络框架，能够生成具有精确控制孔隙度的代表性孔隙尺度图像，解决地下表征中的代表性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地下表征中孔隙尺度图像代表性不足和物理样本稀缺的挑战，特别是在碳储存、地热能和地下水管理等应用中，了解代表性孔隙形态对实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络框架，在碳酸盐岩地层的薄片样本上训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数为条件，捕捉通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定的地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了优异的孔隙度控制（R^2=0.95），平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197。生成图像的代表性误差为1.9-11.3%，远低于随机提取真实子图像的36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该框架为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能和地下水管理等需要了解代表性孔隙形态的应用领域。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MRI加速范式，从图像重建转向预测性成像，通过生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，显著提高高加速因子下的重建质量。


<details>

Motivation: MRI采集时间长限制了临床吞吐量，需要新的方法来加速MRI扫描过程。

Method: 使用生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，然后重建高度欠采样数据。模型条件输入包括其他对比度图像、先前扫描图像、采集参数和患者信息。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在x4、x8和x12高加速因子下，该方法显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架引入了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本性转变，为MRI加速提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

TL;DR: PRGCN是一个新颖的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过跨序列模式重用机制，将姿态估计转化为模式检索和适应问题，在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准上达到了最先进水平。


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有视频方法仅处理单个序列的局限性，无法利用跨序列中普遍存在的结构规律和重复运动模式，从而改善单目3D人体姿态估计这一病态逆问题。

Method: 提出模式重用图卷积网络(PRGCN)，包含图记忆库存储姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索，结合Mamba状态空间模型的自注意力和局部时序建模的双流混合架构。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准上分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，建立了新的最先进水平，并展现出增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动该领域发展至关重要，将范式从每序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提出通过插补和加权重采样方法来消除甲烷羽流检测中标签与覆盖率的虚假关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像中由于云层等因素导致的系统性缺失像素会造成表示偏差，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型可能错误地将图像覆盖率与标签关联，导致低覆盖率图像中羽流检测不足。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法，并提出在训练期间使用加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间内强制类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 重采样和插补都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的能力更强。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏技术能有效解决卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提高模型在低覆盖率图像中的检测性能。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关问题，通过因果视觉提示和特征解耦显著提升了模型泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉令牌占总令牌的97-99%，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像已足够。

Method: 使用紧凑的VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应何时收敛到其正确回答的峰值能力，训练为离散分类器但推理时可插值连续分辨率。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择分辨率，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，为高效视觉语言处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过混合视频生成和智能帧选择策略，有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机位姿估计难题，在多个数据集上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究七个最先进视觉语言模型的计数能力，进行分层分析，并针对性地仅微调输出层进行训练。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感，分层分析显示错误源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题。仅微调输出层可将准确率提升高达21%，并在真实数据集上获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在计数任务中的失败主要源于输出映射问题，通过有针对性的微调可以显著提升性能，这为改进模型推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势，但两者存在显著的时空不对称性，阻碍了有效的多模态融合

Method: 提出分层非对称蒸馏框架，采用分层对齐策略，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失

Result: 在广泛实验中一致优于最先进方法，消融研究验证了各设计组件的有效性和必要性

Conclusion: HAD框架成功解决了多模态融合中的时空不对称问题，显著提升了目标跟踪性能

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 随着目标检测模型在自动驾驶等系统中的部署，确保其安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注图像域攻击，视频域攻击尤其是无盒设置下的攻击尚未充分研究。

Conclusion: 揭示了视频感知系统中先前未探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗设置中考虑alpha通道防御的紧迫需求。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: VGD通过显式几何学习和特征一致性监督，有效解决了环绕视图重建中的几何一致性和新视角质量问题，实现了高质量的场景重建。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Conclusion: 为解决复杂多焦点图像融合挑战提供了重要进展，代码和权重已公开。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLMs的注意力图直接转换为视频分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现出色，但其原始注意力图存在噪声且与物体区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来精炼这些注意力图以实现视频分割。

Method: 提出分解注意力融合(DecAF)，包含对比性物体-背景融合和互补视频帧融合两种机制，结合注意力引导的SAM2提示来获得细粒度掩码。

Result: DecAF在无需训练的方法中表现优异，在参考和推理视频对象分割基准上达到与基于训练方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了无需重新训练MLLMs即可实现高质量视频分割的可行性，为训练自由的视频理解任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过生成多个多样化的伪造定位图来解决图像伪造定位中的不确定性，显著提升了定位精度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: 采用条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，在扩散过程中引入伯努利噪声以更好反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性，并设计时间步交叉注意力机制(TSCAttention)利用语义特征和时间步信息。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个多样化定位图有效处理伪造区域的不确定性，在真实世界部署中具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准XBench，用于评估胸部X射线中跨模态可解释性，发现当前视觉语言模型在医学图像中的定位能力有限，特别是对于小病灶或弥散性病变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，但其在医学领域中的可解释性和定位能力尚未充分探索，而可靠的定位对于临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域的匹配度，测试了7种CLIP风格的VLM变体。

Result: 发现：(1)所有VLM变体对大型明确病变定位合理，但对小或弥散病变性能显著下降；(2)在胸部X射线特定数据集上预训练的模型表现更好；(3)模型识别能力与定位能力高度相关。

Conclusion: 当前VLM尽管识别能力强，但在临床可靠定位方面仍有不足，强调在医学实践中部署前需要进行有针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来抑制高斯噪声，在卡通图像去噪中达到了极小极大渐近界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器（如小波、曲波等）在适应复杂信号规律性方面不够充分，特别是对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2且为未知参数时，这些方法不是最优的。深度卷积神经网络虽然取得了更好的数值结果，但需要更简化的模型。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过小波系数模的二次小波变换计算。提出去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来实现去噪。

Result: 数值实验表明，该去噪估计器对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都达到了极小极大渐近界。证明了ℓ¹范数能够捕捉不同类型的几何图像规律性。

Conclusion: 该方法为信号去噪和函数几何规律性描述提供了不同的调和分析方法，并在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Conclusion: GenComm通过生成式通信有效解决了异构多智能体协作中的领域差距问题，实现了高效、可扩展的感知增强。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

<details>

Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法面临数据稀缺、边界模糊和细粒度语义区分不足三个关键瓶颈，导致模型陷入局部最优，缺乏鲁棒的边界和语义区分能力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义意识；蒸馏阶段引入双重查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性并实现现实世界泛化。

Result: 在多个基准测试上，AMR相比先前最先进方法实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: AMR框架通过零外部依赖的增强方法有效解决了时刻检索中的关键瓶颈，在保持知识一致性的同时实现了更好的现实世界泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在医疗领域表现不佳，主要因为缺乏高质量医疗影像数据集和忽视了从粗到细的诊断过程。

Method: 构建CT-RATE-VQA数据集（84K QA对），提出MedReason-R1模型，嵌入放大病灶区域，并引入GRPO强化学习框架。

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式推理过程和强化学习，有效提升了医疗视觉语言模型的诊断性能。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和参数扰动重新激活机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建伪影问题，在保持几何细节的同时实现了最先进的视图合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中会出现过重建伪影（局部模糊和针状扭曲），现有方法认为这是大规模高斯分布分裂不足导致的，但本文发现根本限制在于致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和原始冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1) 重要性感知致密化准则，整合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的原始增长；(2) 重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的原始分布。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在标准新视图合成指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持了精细的几何细节。

Conclusion: 重新激活机制在与其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）集成时也带来了一致的改进，证明了其广泛的适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法在医学成像中经常扭曲微血管等精细曲线结构，影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为重要。

Method: CST框架通过添加曲线结构提取模块提供拓扑监督，可无缝集成到现有方法中，已集成到CycleGAN和UNSB两种代表性骨干网络中。

Result: 在光学相干断层扫描血管成像、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影三种成像模态上的综合评估表明，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过加强学习映射中的几何完整性，CST为医学成像中曲线结构感知的跨域翻译建立了原则性途径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习活体检测系统多为黑盒模型，决策过程不透明，需要解释性技术来理解模型行为

Method: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，为深度学习人脸活体检测系统提供视觉解释，识别关键区域

Result: 该方法能够提供详细的视觉解释，帮助理解系统将生物特征图像判定为真实或伪造的原因

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM提高了深度学习人脸活体检测系统的透明度和可信度

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，有效抑制视觉干扰因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量面临背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等视觉干扰因素的挑战，需要开发能够学习鲁棒稳定潜在表示的框架。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器通过全局注意力关注动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并使用李雅普诺夫稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验显示，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和变换器基线中达到最低分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束能够产生既准确又物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法面临两个主要挑战：激活值的高度不均匀分布，以及权重量化中使用的静态不匹配码本。

Method: 提出自适应分布感知量化(ADQ)混合精度量化框架，包含三个关键创新：基于分位数的码本初始化方法、基于指数移动平均的在线码本自适应机制、以及敏感度指导的混合精度分配策略。对于激活值，集成了硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射方案。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18仅用2.81比特平均位宽达到71.512%的Top-1准确率，在可比条件下优于最先进方法。在CIFAR-10上的消融研究系统验证了各创新组件的贡献。

Conclusion: ADQ框架通过自适应权重量化方案有效解决了量化感知训练中的分布不均匀和码本不匹配问题，在低比特量化下实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多功能多模态人体运动生成框架，使用自回归扩散变换器以统一序列到序列方式处理多种任务，包括文本到运动、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态人体运动生成中的一致性和控制性问题，需要开发一个能够统一处理多种任务并确保生成内容质量和一致性的框架。

Method: 提出使用参考运动作为新的条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，并构建了最大的统一多模态运动数据集OmniMoCap-X。

Result: 实验评估表明OmniMotion-X显著超越现有方法，在多个多模态任务上达到最先进性能，能够生成真实、连贯和可控的长时运动。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X提供了一个强大且灵活的多模态运动生成框架，通过统一的序列到序列方法和高质量数据集，实现了在各种任务上的优异表现。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在分布偏移时性能下降，现有测试时自适应方法忽略了长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类混淆这两个关键挑战。

Method: 提出类感知原型缓存模块动态调整每类容量，负对比学习机制约束困难负样本，采用非对称优化仅更新文本原型而固定视觉特征。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上始终优于先前的测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC通过原型缓存和负对比学习有效提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Motivation: 多模态模型在文本引导图像编辑方面取得了显著进展，但研究社区因缺乏基于真实图像的大规模、高质量、开放可访问数据集而受到限制。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages集合的真实照片生成多样化的编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保编辑类型全面覆盖，并通过MLLM质量评分和精心策划保持内容保留和指令忠实度。

Conclusion: 通过提供这个大规模、高质量和任务丰富的资源，Pico-Banana-400K为训练和基准测试下一代文本引导图像编辑模型建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Motivation: 单目深度估计进展迅速，但评估方法缺乏标准化，现有指标的行为和权衡未被充分理解，需要与人类判断进行对比分析。

Method: 对现有指标进行定量分析，测试它们对地面真值各种扰动的敏感性，并与人类判断进行比较。

Result: 发现现有指标对曲率扰动严重不敏感，如使平坦表面变波浪形。

Conclusion: 提出了基于相对表面法线的新指标、新的深度可视化工具以及创建与人类判断更一致组合指标的原理方法。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data
are available at: https://github.com/princeton-vl/evalmde.

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in

methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical

TL;DR: 提出了一个3D优化框架，联合校准AI推理扩展中的准确性、成本和延迟，通过多目标优化方法在统一决策空间中实现约束感知的推理扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI推理扩展方法通常使用1D启发式或2D双变量权衡，无法同时考虑成本、延迟和准确性约束，需要更全面的优化框架。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟在三个代表性场景和九个模拟大语言模型上评估四种优化方法，解决3D多目标优化问题。

Result: 膝点优化方法实现了最佳平衡，而精度最大化在优先考虑精度时仍然有利。该框架为不同操作环境下的部署感知推理扩展建立了理论基础。

Conclusion: 将推理扩展框架化为多目标优化问题，能够形成1D和2D优化无法捕捉的可行空间，实现环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

Conclusion: 该基础模型具有促进当前神经影像在临床常规应用中应用的巨大潜力。

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

Motivation: 最小二乘法在现代机器学习中的潜力远未被充分发掘，仅被视为线性模型拟合工具，需要将其转化为可微分算子来释放其潜力。

Method: 推导自定义梯度，将最小二乘求解器转化为可微分算子，使其能够像神经网络层一样使用。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发可微分线性代数工具的重要进展，使这些工具能够更广泛地应用于机器学习实践。

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

TL;DR: ADPO是一个统一框架，扩展了DPO，引入软偏好概率、任意参考策略锚定和列表偏好建模，在噪声环境中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，在存在不确定性和噪声时表现不佳。ADPO旨在通过软偏好概率、参考策略锚定和列表扩展来克服这些限制。

Method: ADPO引入：(1)软偏好概率编码不确定性并减轻梯度漂移；(2)任意参考策略锚定通过组间平移不变性和隐式KL正则化稳定训练；(3)通过Plackett-Luce分布进行列表偏好建模。

Result: 在上下文赌博机中，锚定比标准DPO提升WinMass 38-63%，KDE平滑在重尾噪声下达到0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）。在顺序强化学习中，锚定在噪声偏好下性能提升15-29%。

Conclusion: ADPO为DPO提供了统一扩展，在噪声环境中显著优于标准方法。建议在清洁或中等噪声下使用成对锚定Soft-DPO，在极端污染下使用基于KDE的列表ADPO。

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了噪声鲁棒的GRPO和Dr.GRPO框架，通过建模奖励噪声为伯努利噪声并进行噪声校正，在数学和代码任务上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF/RLVR方法对不一致或错误奖励产生的噪声高度敏感，而噪声与基于群体的策略优化方法的相互作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入GRPO和Dr.GRPO框架，将奖励噪声建模为伯努利噪声，通过估计奖励翻转概率进行噪声校正，获得无偏梯度估计。

Result: 在数学任务上准确率提升高达6.7个百分点，代码任务上提升1.5个百分点，在真实奖励模型条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF相结合，为噪声现实部署提供了理论洞见和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂多尺度系统提供了有效的建模方法，能够在所有时间尺度上提供近似和解释，适应实际应用需求。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

Motivation: 离策略强化学习虽然提高了样本效率，但存在策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃的挑战。研究发现负优势样本主导策略梯度抑制有用行为，以及PPO类目标中的固定裁剪机制系统性地阻止熵增加的更新。

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则，动态调整裁剪边界来自适应地重新平衡正负贡献，保持熵值并稳定RL优化。

Result: 在多样化的离策略场景中，BAPO实现了快速、稳定和数据高效的训练。在AIME 2024和2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越开源对手，32B BAPO模型在同规模模型中达到最先进水平，甚至优于领先的专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO通过动态裁剪机制有效解决了离策略RL中的优化不平衡问题，实现了稳定高效的训练，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [84] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 许多深度神经网络的后验泛化度量是脆弱的——微小的训练修改会显著改变度量的值、趋势或缩放行为，即使这些修改几乎不影响网络本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度神经网络的泛化度量难以获得紧致边界，但通常被认为能重现定性泛化趋势。本文质疑这种假设，指出许多后验度量实际上很脆弱。

Method: 通过实验分析不同泛化度量对训练微小变化的敏感性，包括超参数调整、优化器切换等，评估度量的稳定性。

Result: 发现路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes代理等度量都很脆弱，而PAC-Bayes原点度量虽然对超参数变化较不敏感，但无法捕捉数据复杂度的差异。

Conclusion: 泛化度量的开发者应该明确审计其脆弱性，避免依赖不稳定的度量来评估模型泛化能力。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并引入旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，而选择性原位适应方法适应更精确但内存消耗大。需要平衡这种权衡。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数（连接），然后为这些选定参数引入旁路连接。在微调期间只更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实证结果表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%的可训练参数即可达到最先进性能，同时将CUDA内存使用量减少高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功解决了参数高效微调中的权衡问题，实现了细粒度适应和高内存效率的平衡。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Method: 使用可微分数值求解器作为教师模型监督学生神经算子，通过PGD风格主动采样在平滑性和能量约束下寻找最坏情况输入来扩展训练集。

Result: 在Burgers和Navier-Stokes系统上的实验表明，对抗蒸馏显著提高了分布外鲁棒性，同时保持了神经算子的低参数成本和快速推理优势。

Conclusion: 对抗蒸馏框架有效解决了神经算子的分布外泛化问题，为PDE求解提供了既高效又鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Motivation: 自编码器在时间序列异常检测中广泛应用，但其学习到的表示对训练时间序列中的异常敏感，导致精度降低。需要提高在污染时间序列训练时的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过新的编码-分解范式和互信息指标，有效提高了时间序列异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient

patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

Conclusion: SGT通过可学习的形状函数在保持可解释性的同时，有效提升了决策树的性能并减小了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在联邦学习后门攻击层选择问题上的有效性，能够动态学习攻击策略，在保持隐蔽性的同时实现高攻击成功率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模实证研究发现，Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) 的学习率缩放规则仅在训练初期有效，而在实际应用中，权重衰减才是稳定内部表示更新动态的关键因素，这挑战了现有的学习率传递认知。


<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是探索如何将小规模神经网络的最优学习率有效传递到大规模网络中，以解决超参数调优在大规模训练中的高昂成本问题。

Method: 通过大规模实证调查，分析muP学习率缩放规则在实际训练场景中的有效性，特别关注权重衰减在稳定更新动态中的作用。

Result: 研究发现muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，而在大部分训练过程中，权重衰减才是稳定内部表示更新动态的关键，这解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体才能成功传递学习率。

Conclusion: muP的缩放主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用，可以通过修改预热调度来替代，这从根本上挑战了关于学习率传递的现有认知。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

Conclusion: 挑战了通用课程策略的概念，提供跨模型和任务体系的可操作指导，某些指标显示优先处理决策不确定样本可进一步改善学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

*Matthew Raffel,Adwaith Renjith,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster框架通过元学习器和聚类技术，将KANs的参数存储量减少高达80倍，同时保持准确性不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用向量权重替代标量权重提高了表达能力，但导致参数和内存呈乘性增长，需要压缩方法。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将系数向量映射到低维流形，然后进行K-means聚类，用共享质心替代每边向量，最后微调质心码本。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，标准KANs和ConvKANs的参数存储量减少高达80倍，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功实现了KANs的高效压缩，利用参数向量特性跨多个系数分摊存储成本。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

*Ahmed Sayeed Faruk,Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在上下文线性赌博机框架下学习同伴影响力概率的问题，揭示了遗憾最小化与估计误差之间的基本权衡，并提出了一种通过调整参数实现该权衡范围内任意配对的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交网络中，同伴推荐的成功率高度依赖于上下文因素，准确估计这些影响力概率对于理解信息传播过程和改善病毒式营销策略至关重要。然而，从数据中学习这些概率具有挑战性：静态数据只能捕获相关性，而在线学习算法要么浪费资源进行随机探索，要么偏向探索高影响力概率的空间。

Method: 采用上下文线性赌博机框架，提出了一种不确定性引导的探索算法，通过调整参数可以在遗憾最小化与估计误差之间实现任意权衡配对。

Result: 在半合成网络数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于静态方法和忽略这种权衡的上下文赌博机算法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了学习同伴影响力概率时存在的根本权衡，提出的算法能够灵活地在不同目标之间进行平衡，为信息传播建模和营销策略优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

TL;DR: MusicRFM框架通过递归特征机器实现对预训练音乐模型的细粒度控制，无需重新训练即可通过操纵内部激活来指导音乐生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控音乐生成方法通常需要模型重训练或会产生可听伪影，需要一种能够在不影响生成质量的前提下对冻结预训练模型进行细粒度控制的方法。

Method: 训练轻量级RFM探针发现MusicGen隐藏状态中的概念方向，在推理时将这些方向注入回模型，通过动态时间变化调度和多重音乐属性同时执行机制实现实时控制。

Result: 将目标音符生成准确率从0.23提升到0.82，同时文本提示保持度与未控制基线仅相差约0.02，在控制效果和提示保真度之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: MusicRFM成功解决了控制与生成质量之间的权衡问题，展示了在音乐领域应用RFM的有效性，为冻结预训练模型的可控生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Motivation: 传统Granger因果性测试基于线性模型，难以检测非线性因果关系。现有非线性方法依赖两个关键假设：因果充分性和已知干预目标，但在实际中这些假设往往不成立，存在潜在混杂因素和环境异质性。

Method: 提出InvarGC方法，利用跨环境异质性来缓解潜在混杂因素影响，以边缘级粒度区分干预和非干预环境，恢复不变因果关系，并建立了可识别性条件。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争优势。

Conclusion: InvarGC方法能够有效处理存在潜在混杂因素和环境异质性的情况，在因果结构发现方面表现优异。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型越来越多地在合成数据上进行微调，存在亚临界腐败的严重风险，即不良特性通过语义中立数据传播，绕过标准安全检查。目前缺乏对这一现象动态的定量理解。

Method: 使用GPT-2构建师生设置，系统研究亚临界腐败的缩放规律、阈值和机制，包括行为交叉分析、相变临界点检测和可解释性分析。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：(1)亚临界腐败导致行为交叉，降低模型整体对齐性；(2)对齐性在污染数据达到临界阈值时发生急剧相变；(3)可解释性分析显示腐败机制模仿自然微调过程，难以检测。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了依赖合成数据的AI系统中的关键漏洞，强调需要能够考虑潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

Motivation: 解决参数高效微调方法在权重空间操作时过度专业化、容易覆盖预训练知识的问题，特别是在下游数据有限或与预训练分布差异大的场景中。

Method: 在特征空间进行微调，提出LoRFA（低秩特征适配）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适配），通过建模下游潜伏变量的效应等价来补偿分布偏移。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上，特征空间适配方法达到与标准微调相当的性能，并在鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 特征空间微调能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，保持预训练表示，提升模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统部分监测问题只能处理有限结果空间，而线性部分监测可以建模无限结果空间，同时在线性损失和观测结构上提供了更灵活的框架，将线性赌博机问题推广到损失和反馈解耦的情况。

Method: 采用探索优化方法的简单实例，适用于高效实现。该方法能够根据游戏结构透明地推导遗憾界，包含反映观测与损失对齐程度的实例特定量。

Result: 在易游戏（局部可观测）中获得标准√T遗憾率，在难游戏（全局可观测）中获得T^{2/3}遗憾率。这些界限在多个部分信息设置中实例化，并证明了对游戏结构的依赖在有趣情况下是紧的。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在线性部分监测框架下实现了最优的遗憾界，为处理无限结果空间和灵活反馈结构的非随机对抗性问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

Conclusion: 这些结果为理解NGVI在具有挑战性的推断设置中的几何性质和收敛行为提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

TL;DR: 论文发现多任务后训练中不同任务产生的梯度大小差异显著，大梯度任务并不一定带来更大的学习收益，这种梯度不平衡源于任务间的固有差异，需要谨慎处理数据集混合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务后训练通常假设所有任务贡献相似大小的梯度，但本文发现这个假设在强化学习后训练中不成立，某些任务会产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏向这些任务。

Method: 通过分析不同任务在RL后训练中产生的梯度大小和学习收益，研究梯度不平衡现象及其与典型训练统计量（如训练奖励或优势）的关系。

Result: 发现大梯度任务并不对应更大的学习收益，某些大梯度任务的学习收益甚至低于小梯度任务，且梯度不平衡不能由训练奖励或优势等统计量解释。

Conclusion: 梯度不平衡源于任务间的固有差异，需要避免简单的数据集混合，未来应研究基于梯度级别的校正方法。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架在显著降低通信负担的同时保持了多智能体系统的协调性能，为通信受限环境下的多智能体强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Motivation: 婴儿能够在无监督情况下发现类别、检测新颖性并适应新情境，这对当前机器学习构成挑战，需要开发更接近人类认知能力的算法。

Method: 采用有限分辨率聚类框架，使用单一分辨率参数和吸引-排斥动力学，配合mheatmap评估工具提供比例热图和重分配算法来评估多分辨率和动态行为。

Result: 在多个数据集上，configurations在标准聚类指标上具有竞争力，新颖性检测AUC达到87%，在动态类别演化中稳定性提升35%。

Conclusion: configurations为早期认知分类提供了一个原则性的计算模型，是向大脑启发的AI迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)训练过程中的设计选择如何影响模型质量，重点研究补丁大小、嵌入选择、训练目标等设计参数如何导致模型在时间行为、几何结构等方面的隐式偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解时间序列基础模型训练过程中的各种"旋钮"如何影响模型质量，而不是开发新的模型并声称其在现有基准上表现更好。

Method: 结合理论和受控实证评估，识别关键设计选择（补丁大小、嵌入选择、训练目标等），分析这些选择如何导致模型基本属性的隐式偏差。

Result: 发现设计选择会导致模型在时间行为、几何结构、回归均值倾向等方面的隐式偏差，这些偏差可能是直观的或反直觉的，取决于模型和数据的特性。

Conclusion: 通过异常值处理的案例研究说明多重偏差如何复杂交互，讨论了研究结果对学习"苦涩教训"和构建TSFMs的启示。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

TL;DR: SPOT是一种用于计算决策树策略的新方法，将优化问题表述为混合整数线性规划，通过解耦MDP动态和树结构约束实现高效并行搜索，显著提升运行时间和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险决策中，可解释的强化学习策略至关重要，但在马尔可夫决策过程中优化决策树策略仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将优化问题表述为混合整数线性规划，采用缩减空间的分支定界方法，解耦MDP动态和树结构约束，实现高效并行搜索。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SPOT实现了显著加速，可扩展到具有更多状态的更大MDP，产生的决策树策略可解释且紧凑，在保持透明度的同时不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，比现有方法快一个数量级地提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SILVER with RL-guided labeling，通过将RL策略自身的动作输出纳入边界点识别，将SILVER框架扩展到多动作和高维环境，显著提升了深度强化学习策略的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能出色但缺乏可解释性，限制了人们对策略行为的信任。现有的SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域，需要扩展到更复杂的环境。

Method: 首先从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，进行SHAP特征归因，然后使用RL引导的标签生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，结果显示该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将SILVER转变为可扩展且行为感知的框架，推进了可解释RL的发展，能够在高维多动作设置中解释深度RL智能体。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类具有按相似性分组对象的天生能力，聚类算法旨在模拟这种认知机制。最近在社区检测方面的进展使得能够在多个分辨率尺度上发现有效的层次聚类配置，而无需标记数据。

Method: 引入GraMixC模块，提取配置，使用反向合并/拆分(RMS)技术对齐它们，并通过注意力头融合它们，然后传递给任何下游预测器。

Result: 在DSN1 16S rRNA培养介质预测任务中，GraMixC将R2分数从0.6提高到0.9，在标准表格基准测试中始终优于单分辨率和静态特征基线。

Conclusion: GraMixC是一个即插即用模块，能够有效提取和融合配置，显著提升下游任务的预测性能，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对分类任务和表示层面的去偏，无法充分处理节点回归任务的连续特性，因此需要专门针对回归任务的公平性框架。

Method: 采用三级干预策略：结构层面的边重加权、表示层面的MMD对齐、预测层面的Sinkhorn分布匹配。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，FnRGNN能够减少群体差异，同时不牺牲性能表现。

Conclusion: FnRGNN是一个有效的公平性感知处理框架，适用于图神经网络节点回归任务，能够在复杂图拓扑下确保鲁棒的公平性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型虽然比Transformer更高效，但训练成本高且生态系统不成熟，且与Transformer的结构差异使得知识蒸馏困难。

Method: 使用轻量级注意力桥实现token级监督，结合灵活的分层对齐策略来适应师生模型间的架构差异。

Result: 在视觉和语言领域的广泛实验中，该方法持续提升状态空间模型性能，在有限训练数据下也优于标准和跨架构蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 注意力知识可以有效转移到循环模型中，为构建更强的SSM社区快速利用Transformer专业知识提供了可能。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

Motivation: 深度集成虽然能提供最先进的不确定性量化，但计算和内存需求大，难以部署到实际应用中。现有知识蒸馏方法在压缩模型大小时难以保持不确定性。

Method: 使用深度潜变量因子模型将教师集成视为随机过程的实现，通过期望最大化算法稳定估计均值和协方差函数，实现分布蒸馏。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，高斯蒸馏优于现有基线方法，在语言模型微调和分布偏移问题上表现良好。

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏是一种有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够更好地保持教师集成的不确定性，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在Verilog代码生成方面取得显著进展，但缺乏有意义的功能奖励阻碍了基于强化学习的偏好优化，难以生成功能正确的Verilog代码。

Method: 通过比较生成模块与参考模块的信号功能正确性，提取已验证的信号感知实现；使用抽象语法树识别信号感知代码片段；引入信号感知DPO在正确的信号级代码段上进行优化。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM上实现最先进性能，7B参数模型匹配DeepSeek v3 671B模型的性能，显著优于在同一数据集上训练的开源模型CodeV。

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV标志着Verilog代码生成从传统模块级优化向细粒度信号级优化的范式转变，有效解决了功能奖励不足的问题。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在并行解码时存在采样墙问题：一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息会坍缩为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤信息受限

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，采用自条件策略高效训练LDDMs模型

Result: 生成困惑度相比基线降低61%，在算术推理任务（如Countdown和Game of 24）上性能提升，生成文本更连贯

Conclusion: Loopholing机制有效缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的高质量路径

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的预测形式对实际应用价值的影响，指出虽然这些模型在预测精度上表现良好，但预测形式（点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成）决定了其能支持的操作任务类型。

Result: 发现三分之二的TSFMs仅产生点预测或参数预测，而轨迹集成可以转换为更简单的形式，但反向转换需要额外假设。不同联合分布可能具有相同的边际分布但给出不同的操作问题答案。

Conclusion: 提出了任务对齐的评估框架，阐明了预测类型而非精度如何区分实际效用，为TSFMs的实用价值评估提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

### [122] [A New Type of Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19347)
*Xingyang Nie,Guojie Xiao,Su Pan,Biao Wang,Huilin Ge,Tao Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种与常规对抗样本相反的对抗样本生成方法，这些样本与原始样本显著不同但产生相同输出，并开发了NI-FGSM、NI-FGM等算法来生成此类样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗样本是在原始样本附近添加微小扰动导致模型误分类，本文探索相反的情况：生成与原始样本显著不同但模型输出相同的样本。

Method: 提出了负迭代快速梯度符号法(NI-FGSM)和负迭代快速梯度法(NI-FGM)，以及它们的动量变体NMI-FGSM和NMI-FGM，用于生成这类对抗样本。

Result: 生成的对抗样本可用于特定场景下的机器学习系统攻击，并且发现对抗样本不仅分布在数据集样本邻域，而是广泛分布在样本空间中。

Conclusion: 对抗样本的分布范围比传统认知更广泛，本文提出的方法为理解模型决策边界和安全性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Motivation: 分支定界求解器的性能受变量选择启发式策略影响，现有方法缺乏原则性的MDP公式来学习最优分支策略。

Method: 引入BBMDP，一种用于分支定界变量选择的纯MDP公式，能够利用广泛的RL算法来学习最优分支启发式策略。

Result: 计算实验验证了模型的有效性，提出的分支智能体在四个标准MILP基准测试中优于先前最先进的RL智能体。

Conclusion: BBMDP提供了一个原则性的MDP框架，能够有效学习分支定界中的最优变量选择策略，提升MILP求解性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LinUCB在推荐系统中训练、推理和内存成本随特征维度和动作空间增长，关键瓶颈是需要更新、求逆和存储包含交互历史上下文信息的设计矩阵。

Method: 使用动态低秩参数化逆Cholesky因子，推导数值稳定的秩1和批量更新方法，无需直接形成整个矩阵。采用投影器-分裂积分器控制内存增长。

Result: 实现了平均每步更新成本O(dr)和内存O(dr)，推理复杂度为O(dr)每个动作评估。在推荐系统数据集上的实验验证了算法有效性。

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB算法通过低秩近似显著降低了线性上下文bandit的计算和内存开销，同时保持了性能。

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Method: 使用ConvNeXt块与Transformer编码器的混合架构，采用自适应梯度裁剪和梯度对齐噪声注入的差分隐私机制，利用截断奇异值分解进行梯度处理。

Result: 在OxIOD、RIDI、RoNIN基准数据集上，ConvXformer超越了现有方法，定位精度提升超过40%，同时确保(ε,δ)-差分隐私保证。在KAIST机械工程楼收集的Mech-IO数据集上验证了在严重环境干扰下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于网络物理系统中安全智能导航，在严重环境失真下表现出鲁棒性，实现了隐私保护与模型性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种从多变量时间序列中提取系统'年龄'代理特征的方法，通过优化公式的单调性来发现能够代表系统老化过程的潜在特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接提供'年龄'信息。需要从现有传感器数据中发现能够代表系统老化过程的代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化公式的单调性（基于Spearman秩相关系数）来发现潜在的年龄代理特征。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够将单调性较低的单传感器特征组合成单调性高的潜在特征。在InfraWatch结构健康监测项目中，两个单调性分别为0.13和0.09的特征被组合成单调性达0.95的代理特征。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够发现可解释的公式，这些公式可以作为系统'年龄'的有效代理特征。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态的、质量感知的图-文本对齐框架，能够根据监督质量在表达性多对多和保守一对一目标之间动态调整，解决了现有图-文本对齐方法在噪声监督下的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP风格图-文本对齐方法存在两个关键限制：假设节点和文本之间存在严格的一对一对应关系，忽略了现实世界图中固有的多对多关系；依赖静态对齐目标，无法适应不同的数据质量，在噪声监督下变得脆弱。

Method: ADAligner通过实时估计批次级别的对齐可靠性，并相应调整其优化策略：当监督干净时促进软性的子图级别多对多对齐，而在噪声下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上始终优于先前的图-文本对齐方法。它在噪声监督下保持强大的鲁棒性，并且与多模态基线相比，预训练速度提高了约2到3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为现实世界网络环境中的图-文本表示学习建立了一个可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态调整对齐策略解决了多对多关系与噪声监督之间的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CPSVD方法，通过智能分割参数矩阵来改进SVD压缩：保留高误差列，仅对低误差列应用SVD，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD方法统一处理整个参数矩阵，忽略了不同矩阵部分SVD近似误差的显著差异，导致压缩效果不佳。

Method: CPSVD方法识别并直接保留分解误差高的矩阵列，仅对低误差列应用SVD，同时自适应地为LLM中不同模块分配非均匀压缩率。

Result: 实验表明CPSVD在零样本任务上持续优于最先进的SVD压缩方法，获得更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过考虑矩阵分解误差的异质性和自适应压缩策略，显著提升了LLM压缩性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应秩分配(ARA)方法，通过专用掩码设计和额外损失函数，解决SVD压缩中不同线性模块的秩分配问题，在LLaMA2-7B模型上实现最先进的压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法在确定不同线性模块的秩时存在局限：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以有效捕捉奇异值谱与可训练参数的关系，且忽略增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优。

Method: ARA方法包含：(1)专用掩码设计，实现保留秩与可训练参数之间的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数，引导参数选择朝向全局最优解。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型80%压缩比下，ARA将WikiText2的困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: ARA方法在SVD基LLM压缩中实现了有效的秩分配，显著提升了压缩模型的性能。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

Result: 对于线性模型证明该迭代训练方案收敛，经验证明随机傅里叶特征增强网络表达能力，在经典基准问题上优于现有算法。

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN通过傅里叶特征增强有效克服频谱偏差，在频率域上实现改进的逼近性能。

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

Conclusion: FairNet提供了一个灵活处理不同敏感属性标签场景的动态公平校正框架，能有效解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

<details>

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法依赖梯度上升来降低特定目标响应的概率，但会产生挤压效应——概率质量被重新分配到高似然区域，导致语义相关的重述仍然存在，造成虚假遗忘。

Method: 提出自举框架，将挤压效应与模型自身的高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来。通过联合抑制目标响应和模型信念，BS-T衰减高概率token，BS-S移除整个高置信度生成，共同对抗挤压效应。

Result: 在不同基准测试和多种模型家族上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性，能够实现更彻底的遗忘同时保持模型效用。

Conclusion: 通过将模型信念纳入遗忘目标，直接对抗挤压效应，提出的自举框架能够实现更彻底的语言模型遗忘，解决了现有方法中虚假遗忘的问题。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定的dropout率，处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，实现快速任务适应。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Motivation: 重新验证Jones等人提出的对抗鲁棒模型普适性假设，测试其通用性。

Method: 在不同数据集上检验表示相似性和预测行为，分析分类层的影响，并通过重新训练分类器来探索更普遍的预测行为。

Result: 在特定设置下验证了高表示相似性，但结果在不同数据集间不一致；预测行为不会随鲁棒性增加而收敛；不同预测源于分类层，但通过重新训练分类器可以实现更普遍的预测行为。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下具有部分普适性，但不支持严格普适性概念。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

*Constance Ferragu,Jonathan D. Ziegler,Nicolas Deutschmann,Arthur Lindoulsi,Eli Bixby,Cradle ML Team*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: g-DPO是一种改进的蛋白质语言模型偏好优化方法，通过序列空间聚类和分组近似计算，解决了标准DPO训练时间随数据集规模二次增长的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO方法在蛋白质工程中面临可扩展性瓶颈：训练对的数量随标记序列数量呈二次增长，导致即使对于中等规模的数据集，训练时间也难以承受。

Method: g-DPO框架采用两种策略：(i)使用序列空间聚类修剪冗余训练对，同时保留训练信号；(ii)通过基于分组的近似计算来分摊似然计算成本。

Result: 在三个蛋白质工程任务中，g-DPO保持了与标准DPO在计算模拟和体外实验中统计上无法区分的性能，同时收敛速度提高了1.8到3.7倍，且随着数据集规模增大，收益预期更大。

Conclusion: g-DPO在保持性能的同时显著提高了DPO的训练效率，为大规模蛋白质工程应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

TL;DR: 提出基于思维链监控的安全案例路线图，通过确保模型在无思维链时缺乏危险能力，以及思维链启用的危险能力可被监控检测，来构建AI安全框架。


<details>

Motivation: 随着AI系统接近危险能力水平，传统的不可能安全案例已不足够，需要替代方法来确保安全。

Method: 提出两阶段安全案例：1) 模型在无思维链时缺乏危险能力；2) 思维链启用的危险能力可被监控检测。分析监控性威胁（神经语言和编码推理），评估保持思维链忠实性的技术，并建立预测市场评估可行性。

Result: 系统性地识别了监控性威胁的三种形式（语言漂移、隐写术、异质推理），并分析了其驱动因素。评估了现有和新颖的思维链忠实性维护技术。

Conclusion: 思维链监控可能支持控制和可信度安全案例，为AI安全提供了有前景的替代方法，但需要通过预测市场等技术里程碑来评估其可行性。

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

TL;DR: INPO是一个基于影响力感知的负偏好优化框架，通过减缓梯度上升的散度速度来提高图遗忘过程中的模型效用鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图遗忘模型使用梯度上升在遗忘集上实现遗忘，但这种方法导致模型效用在遗忘过程中急剧下降，因为梯度上升的散度速度过快。

Method: 提出INPO框架：1）分析NPO具有较慢的散度速度；2）设计影响力感知的消息函数来放大遗忘边的影响力；3）使用基于移除的方法快速估计每条边的影响力；4）提出拓扑熵损失来避免局部结构中的过度信息损失。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，基于INPO的模型在所有遗忘质量指标上都达到了最先进的性能，同时保持了模型的效用。

Conclusion: INPO框架通过减缓散度速度和改善模型效用鲁棒性，在图遗忘任务中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELUTQ是一个高效的量化框架，通过引入分层线性量化(HLQ)格式，在CPU边缘设备上优化LLM部署，显著降低内存使用和延迟，同时消除反量化开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPU边缘设备上部署LLM面临内存和计算资源有限的挑战，现有硬件友好的均匀量化方法无法很好地适应权重分布，且在低比特宽度下反量化开销高。

Method: 提出分层线性量化(HLQ)格式，在不增加位串行LUT-based GEMM计算成本的情况下更好地捕捉权重统计特性，消除反量化开销，并与现有量化算法正交兼容。

Result: 在LLaMA3-8B上，HLQ在3位精度下降低困惑度约8%，2位精度下降低85%；在Apple M2芯片上，2位LLaMA2-7B实现超过25 tokens/s的推理速度。

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架通过HLQ量化格式有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，实现了高效的量化推理性能。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于原型的稀疏反事实解释框架，专门用于12导联心电图分类模型，通过SHAP阈值识别关键信号段、DTW和聚类提取原型，生成仅修改78%原始信号的反事实解释，在保持81.3%有效性的同时提升43%时间稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决最先进模型在时间序列可解释性方面的挑战，特别是在医疗领域如心电图分类中，需要提供可操作且可解释的洞察。

Method: 使用SHAP阈值识别关键信号段并转换为区间规则，利用动态时间规整和聚类提取代表性原型，将这些原型与查询R峰对齐以确保与待解释样本的一致性。

Result: 生成的反事实解释仅修改78%原始信号，所有类别平均有效性达81.3%，时间稳定性提升43%。心肌梗死类别的有效性达98.9%，但肥厚性心肌病检测面临挑战（13.2%有效性）。支持近实时生成（<1秒）。

Conclusion: 为基于AI的诊断系统建立了生理感知反事实解释的设计原则，并为临床部署的用户控制解释界面指明了路径。

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

TL;DR: SpikeQuant是一种结合脉冲神经网络和混合精度量化的方法，用于在边缘设备上高效部署大语言模型，通过二进制脉冲表示和IF机制避免MAC操作和反量化开销，实现W4A4量化下接近FP16的精度，同时能耗降低4.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在边缘设备部署时的三个挑战：MAC操作能耗高、反量化引入额外开销、统一比特宽度会裁剪重要值。受脉冲神经网络启发，利用其二进制脉冲表示和IF机制实现高效计算。

Method: 选择性对重要激活值应用混合精度量化，将其重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，实现动态混合存储。通过将量化尺度嵌入IF机制的阈值中，在权重和激活上执行能量高效的线性变换，避免显式反量化。

Result: 在W4A4量化下持续实现接近FP16的困惑度，同时相比现有方法能耗降低高达4.6倍。

Conclusion: SpikeQuant为准确且能量高效的大语言模型部署提供了有效解决方案，特别适合能量受限的硬件环境。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中表现出优越性能，在不同高斯过程配置下展现出适应性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: REBMBO方法有效克服了传统贝叶斯优化的局限性，在复杂优化任务中表现优异

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Motivation: 现有的单模型一致性方法虽然能有效检测和缓解LLM幻觉，但仍受限于单一模型的训练数据偏差和信息不足。研究者希望探索通过整合多个不同LLM的响应来进一步提升性能。

Method: 提出"联盟一致性"方法，从15个LLM池中选择不同模型组成团队，结合它们对同一提示的不同响应进行聚合分析。

Result: 多模型一致性方法在幻觉检测和缓解方面比单模型方法有显著改进，同时推理成本降低，抵消了单模型一致性方法的主要缺点。

Conclusion: 通过组合具有不同训练背景的多个LLM，可以显著提升幻觉检测和缓解能力，同时实现成本效益的优化。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Motivation: AI方法在药物发现中应用日益广泛，但由于依赖公共数据集而缺乏规模和多样性，限制了工业应用。联邦学习能整合私有数据，但分布式数据访问使数据多样性评估等任务变得复杂。

Method: 在8个不同分子数据集上，对三种联邦聚类方法（Fed-kMeans、Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans、Fed-LSH）与集中式对应方法进行基准测试，使用标准数学指标和新提出的化学指标SF-ICF进行评估。

Result: 大规模基准测试结合深入可解释性分析表明，通过化学指标和客户端可解释性分析将领域知识纳入联邦多样性分析的重要性。

Conclusion: 联邦聚类方法能有效处理分布式分子数据，但需要结合领域特定的评估指标和可解释性分析来获得有意义的多样性分析结果。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Motivation: 传统两阶段方法存在预测-决策错位问题，且观察数据有偏差、实验数据稀缺，导致高方差估计。需要解决这些根本技术挑战。

Method: 开发基于实验数据的无偏OR决策质量估计器，通过代理损失函数引导ML训练；建立双层优化框架，通过隐式微分联合利用观察和实验数据。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL系统性地解决了营销资源分配中的核心挑战，实现了预测与决策的协调，为在线平台提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

Conclusion: MED-LQ展示了在大规模马尔可夫决策过程中更广泛应用潜力，超越了传统方法。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict

channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets

TL;DR: DiffEvac是一种基于生成模型的新方法，通过学习建筑疏散模式实现高效疏散模拟，比传统方法快16倍，将模拟时间缩短至2分钟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细化建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段快速迭代。需要一种更高效的疏散模拟方法支持快速设计迭代。

Method: 建立399个不同功能布局和对应疏散热力图的数据集；提出解耦特征表示法嵌入物理特征；基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比现有条件GAN方法，SSIM提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度快16倍，模拟时间仅需2分钟。案例研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了建模负担，支持大规模假设探索，能与多目标设计工具耦合，为智能建筑安全优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个利用合成ICU时间序列数据来训练和评估预测模型的新框架，通过增强的TimeAutoDiff模型显著减少了真实-合成评估差距，并在细粒度人口亚组中提高了评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在关键医疗领域中缺乏足够真实数据来全面评估AI模型性能的问题，特别是在保护患者隐私的前提下进行细粒度亚组分析。

Method: 基于先前的扩散和VAE生成器，引入了Enhanced TimeAutoDiff，通过添加分布对齐惩罚来增强潜在扩散目标，并在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上对24小时死亡率和住院时间任务进行广泛基准测试。

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实-合成评估差距减少了70%以上，ΔTRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC，同时保持训练效用。在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差减少了50%，并在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 这项工作为关键医疗领域提供了一个实用、保护隐私的可信模型评估路线图，能够在不同患者群体中进行稳健可靠的性能分析，而无需暴露敏感的电子健康记录数据，有助于提高医疗AI的整体可信度。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的多步迭代和复杂网络结构导致高昂的计算成本和生成延迟，限制了实时应用。现有加速技术存在适用性有限、训练成本高或质量下降等问题。

Method: 通过特征级跨步重用和层间调度，在不修改模型参数的情况下减少计算量。从静态重用到动态预测的演进，提高了缓存灵活性。

Conclusion: 这一范式将成为实时高效生成AI的关键推动者，为高效生成智能的理论和实践注入新活力。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体缺乏显式分离任务相关信息与残差信息的机制，限制了在下游任务中的性能表现。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习两个不同的潜在空间，通过新的证据下界公式显式促进潜在空间之间的因子分解，一个空间专门处理任务显著特征，另一个处理残差信息。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA始终优于标准LoRA。虚假相关性评估证实FVAE-LoRA能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过显式分离任务相关特征和残差信息，显著提升了LoRA在下游任务中的性能，并增强了模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的重叠加权正交元学习器，用于在时间变化设置中估计异质处理效应，解决了传统方法在治疗重叠不足时的方差爆炸问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间变化设置中，观察某些治疗序列的概率随预测周期延长呈指数下降，导致数据支持不足和严重重叠问题，现有元学习器在低重叠情况下估计方差会爆炸。

Method: 开发了新颖的Neyman正交总体风险函数，最小化重叠加权的oracle风险，通过数据驱动方法针对高概率治疗序列区域进行估计。

Result: WO学习器具有Neyman正交性，对nuisance函数误设具有鲁棒性，且完全模型无关，可应用于任何机器学习模型。实验证明其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的重叠加权正交元学习器能够有效应对时间变化设置中的治疗重叠问题，获得更可靠的异质处理效应估计。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

Motivation: 传统策略学习算法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中存在风险。研究策略弃权机制，允许策略在不确定时选择安全默认选项，以降低风险。

Method: 提出两阶段学习器：首先识别一组近似最优策略，然后基于这些策略之间的分歧构建弃权规则。在已知倾向得分时建立快速后悔保证，并通过双重稳健目标扩展到未知倾向得分情况。

Result: 建立了O(1/n)类型的快速后悔保证，展示了弃权机制在多种策略学习问题中的应用，包括在边界条件下改进保证、连接分布鲁棒策略学习以及支持安全策略改进。

Conclusion: 弃权是策略学习中的多功能工具，能够在不假设可实现性的情况下改进边界条件保证，通过对冲小数据偏移实现分布鲁棒性，并以高概率确保对基线策略的改进。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

Conclusion: 语义世界模型能够继承预训练视觉语言模型的泛化和鲁棒性特性，为机器人决策规划提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层推测解码（HSD）算法，通过将多个草稿模型堆叠成层次结构来减少Transformer语言模型的推理延迟，相比最佳单草稿基线可获得1.2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法通常只使用单个草稿模型，但实际应用中可能存在多个不同速度和准确性的草稿模型，需要更高效地利用这些模型来进一步降低推理延迟。

Method: HSD将多个草稿模型组织成层次结构，每个模型生成token，下一个更大的模型在单次前向传递中验证这些token，最终由目标模型完成验证。

Result: 推导了任意层次结构的期望延迟表达式，证明选择延迟最优的层次结构可以在多项式时间内完成。实证结果显示HSD相比最佳单草稿基线可获得1.2倍加速。

Conclusion: HSD算法通过层次化利用多个草稿模型，有效降低了生成延迟，超越了现有技术的能力范围。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型需要大规模预训练数据和庞大网络架构，在资源受限环境中部署困难。为了解决通用性与可负担性之间的矛盾，需要开发轻量级但性能强大的模型。

Method: 1) 能量感知频谱分解模块：同时建模高能量和低能量频率信号，提高预训练数据利用率；2) 混合提示Transformer：通过数据集特定提示学习异构时序模式，自适应路由时间序列令牌到基于提示的专家进行参数高效适配。

Conclusion: SEMPO显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小，同时实现了强大的泛化能力，为资源受限环境中的时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

<details>

Motivation: 在高风险应用中部署SGD需要严格量化其固有不确定性，现有高维推理方法计算昂贵且维度缩放受限。

Method: 提出基于在线SGD的程序，在增长维度机制下建立Berry-Esseen界，并开发在线方差估计器。

Result: SGD迭代的CLT在迭代次数t ≳ d^(1+δ)时成立，运行时间为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，显著优于协方差逆方法的O(td² + d³)。

Conclusion: 提出了第一个完全在线和数据驱动的框架，在接近最优缩放机制t ≳ d^(1+δ)下为SGD迭代构建置信区间。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型经常无法学习泛化算法，而是依赖脆弱的启发式方法。作者希望通过图连通性任务来理论解释这一现象，并分析训练动态如何影响模型学习策略。

Method: 使用简化的解耦Transformer架构，理论分析其处理图连通性问题的能力。证明L层模型最多能处理直径为3^L的图，相当于计算邻接矩阵的幂。通过训练动态分析，研究模型在不同容量需求下的学习行为。

Result: 理论证明L层Transformer最多能处理直径为3^L的图。实证显示：当训练图直径在模型容量内时，模型学习正确算法；超出容量时，模型退化为基于节点度的简单启发式方法。限制训练数据在模型容量内可使标准和解耦Transformer都学习精确算法。

Conclusion: Transformer学习算法还是启发式方法取决于训练数据是否在模型容量范围内。在容量内时学习正确算法，超出时退化为简单启发式。通过适当限制训练数据复杂度，可以引导Transformer学习泛化算法而非脆弱启发式。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽视不确定性或缺乏将不确定性纳入的机制，导致解释可能不可靠或误导

Method: 使用共形预测和混合整数线性规划，通过离线树基输入空间分区开发局部化CP程序，实现高效MILP编码

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上优于现有方法，产生更稳健和合理的解释

Conclusion: CONFEX能够生成具有严格预测不确定性和最优性保证的稳健反事实解释

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Conclusion: 该方法为评估模型隐私风险提供了高效实用的工具，特别在大型语言模型风险评估方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

### [163] [GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19778)
*Anand Choudhary,Yasser Sulaıman,Lukas Mauch,Ghouthi Boukli Hacene,Fabien Cardinaux,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP是一种基于梯度的稀疏学习技术，只微调梯度幅度大且预训练幅度小的参数，在保持预训练知识的同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏微调技术效果依赖于最优参数选择，需要找到既高度任务相关又最小化破坏预训练知识的参数。

Method: 基于梯度的稀疏学习，选择梯度幅度最大且预训练幅度最小的参数进行微调。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上优于或匹配LoRA、DoRA、SAFT等参数高效微调技术。

Conclusion: GaLLoP能缓解灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题，保持预训练参数不变，性能更稳定且在不同随机种子上具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

*Shixuan Liu,Yue He,Haotian Wang,Wenjing Yang,Yunfei Wang,Peng Cui,Zhong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaInfer是一种无需环境标签即可推断环境规范的新方法，通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来实现环境分配，在无标签场景下有效解决交替优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法依赖IID数据假设，环境差异处理技术需要环境标签，但这些标签在训练时往往不可得，因为数据采集挑战、隐私问题和环境变异性，特别是在大型公共数据集和隐私敏感领域。

Method: 提出DynaInfer方法，通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，直接从数据中实现环境分配，无需依赖环境标签。

Result: 实验表明DynaInfer优于现有环境分配技术，能快速收敛到真实标签，即使在环境标签可用时也能实现更优性能。

Conclusion: DynaInfer为处理环境差异提供了一种有效的无标签解决方案，在复杂动态系统分析中表现出色。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

*Rohith Kuditipudi,Jing Huang,Sally Zhu,Diyi Yang,Christopher Potts,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种检测模型抄袭的方法，通过分析训练数据顺序与模型输出的相关性来证明Bob是否使用了Alice的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何证明Bob使用了Alice训练的开源模型的问题，特别是在黑盒设置下。

Method: 使用独立性测试框架，基于训练数据顺序的palimpsestic记忆特性，通过查询Bob模型或观察其文本来检测相关性。

Result: 在查询设置中，对40多个微调模型进行测试，p值低至1e-8；在观察设置中，第二种方法仅需几百个token即可可靠区分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效检测模型抄袭，特别是在训练数据随机打乱的情况下，相关性提供了统计证据。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

### [166] [Transformers are almost optimal metalearners for linear classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19797)
*Roey Magen,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论上证明，通过梯度下降训练的简化Transformer架构在线性分类设置中可以作为接近最优的元学习器，仅需少量上下文示例就能适应新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer是否能在无需额外训练的情况下，仅通过少量上下文示例作为元学习器适应新任务，填补现有理论分析在正式元学习设置中的空白。

Method: 使用简化Transformer架构，在类条件高斯混合模型的任务族上进行梯度下降训练，每个任务的均值向量位于共享的k维子空间中。

Result: 训练后，Transformer仅需O(k/R⁴)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，几乎匹配知道共享子空间的最优学习器性能，显著优于仅使用上下文数据的学习器（需要Ω(d/R⁴)示例）。

Conclusion: Transformer可以作为高效的元学习器，其训练任务和示例数量与高维环境维度d无关，在元学习场景中具有理论保证的优越性能。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

TL;DR: 研究分析了巴西和墨西哥在硬件受限条件下训练10万亿token语言模型的技术和经济可行性，发现H100配置成本为8-14百万美元，A100配置为19-32百万美元，建议通过延长训练时间作为政策工具来缓解硬件约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了全球南北之间的结构性不对称，本研究旨在探讨全球南方国家在硬件受限、能源有限和财政约束条件下建立主权级AI能力的可行性。

Method: 采用双轴设计，比较不同加速器（NVIDIA H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），评估计算需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置均低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，H100方案总成本8-14百万美元，A100方案19-32百万美元，硬件效率决定财政可行性。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间应作为缓解硬件约束的政策工具，使中等收入国家能够建立可持续且战略充足的AI能力，生产可用、可审计且本地对齐的模型。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

TL;DR: SBAN是一个大规模多维度数据集，包含300多万个样本，涵盖二进制代码、汇编指令、自然语言描述和源代码四个层次，用于软件代码分析的LLM预训练和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为软件代码分析的大语言模型提供多模态数据集，支持跨表示学习、软件语义理解和自动化恶意软件检测等研究。

Method: 构建包含300多万个样本的数据集，每个样本在四个互补层次上表示：二进制代码、汇编指令、自然语言描述和源代码。

Result: 创建了SBAN数据集，包含290万良性样本和67.2万恶意软件样本，支持代码翻译、代码解释等软件挖掘任务。

Conclusion: SBAN通过连接低级机器表示和高级人类语义，为构建智能代码推理系统提供了坚实基础，为软件行为挖掘和安全分析开辟了新机会。

Abstract: This paper introduces SBAN (Source code, Binary, Assembly, and Natural
Language Description), a large-scale, multi-dimensional dataset designed to
advance the pre-training and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for
software code analysis. SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including
2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across
four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language
descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables
research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software,
and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports
broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software
mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for
scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM
architectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level
human semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent
systems that reason about code. We believe that this dataset opens new
opportunities for mining software behavior, improving security analytics, and
enhancing LLM capabilities in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks for software
code mining.

TL;DR: XGen-Q是基于Qwen-Coder架构的领域适应大语言模型，专门用于恶意软件检测，通过多阶段提示策略和检索增强生成技术，在复杂代码混淆情况下仍能提供可靠的恶意软件识别和详细取证报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有恶意软件检测系统难以泛化到混淆或未知威胁，需要更适应性强且可解释的模型。生成式AI和大语言模型在代码理解方面表现出色，但在网络安全特别是恶意软件检测领域的应用仍然有限。

Method: 基于Qwen-Coder架构构建领域适应LLM，在超过100万个恶意软件样本的大规模语料库上进行预训练，涵盖源代码和汇编代码。采用多阶段提示策略结合检索增强生成(RAG)，并通过系统暴露模型于多样化混淆模式的训练流程来增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，XGen-Q相比竞争基线实现了显著更低的困惑度，并在新型恶意软件样本上表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的方法在可解释和鲁棒的恶意软件分析方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities
in code understanding, but their use in cybersecurity, particularly for malware
detection and analysis, remains limited. Existing detection systems often fail
to generalize to obfuscated or previously unseen threats, underscoring the need
for more adaptable and explainable models. To address this challenge, we
introduce XGen-Q, a domain-adapted LLM built on the Qwen-Coder architecture and
pretrained on a large-scale corpus of over one million malware samples,
spanning both source and assembly code. XGen-Q uses a multi-stage prompt
strategy combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to deliver reliable
malware identification and detailed forensic reporting, even in the presence of
complex code obfuscation. To further enhance generalization, we design a
training pipeline that systematically exposes the model to diverse obfuscation
patterns. Experimental results show that XGen-Q achieves significantly lower
perplexity than competitive baselines and exhibits strong performance on novel
malware samples, demonstrating the promise of LLM-based approaches for
interpretable and robust malware analysis.

TL;DR: C2T-ID是一种新的文档标识符设计方法，通过将语义数值标识符转换为关键词标识符，平衡了语义表达能力和搜索空间约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式检索中语义表达与搜索空间之间的权衡问题。数值标识符缺乏语义信息，而纯文本标识符搜索空间过大且对早期错误敏感。

Method: 首先通过层次聚类构建语义数值docid，然后提取高频元数据关键词并迭代替换数值标签为簇的top-K关键词，最后通过可选的两级语义平滑步骤增强流畅性。

Result: 在Natural Questions和淘宝产品搜索上的实验表明，C2T-ID显著优于原子、语义码本和纯文本docid基线方法。

Conclusion: C2T-ID在平衡语义表达能力和搜索空间约束方面表现出色，是生成式检索中有效的文档标识符设计方法。

Abstract: Designing document identifiers (docids) that carry rich semantic information
while maintaining tractable search spaces is a important challenge in
generative retrieval (GR). Popular codebook methods address this by building a
hierarchical semantic tree and constraining generation to its child nodes, yet
their numeric identifiers cannot leverage the large language model's pretrained
natural language understanding. Conversely, using text as docid provides more
semantic expressivity but inflates the decoding space, making the system
brittle to early-step errors. To resolve this trade-off, we propose C2T-ID: (i)
first construct semantic numerical docid via hierarchical clustering; (ii) then
extract high-frequency metadata keywords and iteratively replace each numeric
label with its cluster's top-K keywords; and (iii) an optional two-level
semantic smoothing step further enhances the fluency of C2T-ID. Experiments on
Natural Questions and Taobao's product search demonstrate that C2T-ID
significantly outperforms atomic, semantic codebook, and pure-text docid
baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing semantic expressiveness
with search space constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常忽略语料库复杂度对密集检索性能的影响，而语料库大小和文档长度是重要因素，需要系统评估嵌入压缩方法。

Method: 引入CoRECT框架，构建新的数据集集合，对8种代表性压缩方法进行基准测试。

Result: 非学习压缩方法在100M段落上能大幅减小索引大小，性能损失统计不显著，但不同模型间性能差异明显。

Conclusion: 压缩方法选择具有挑战性，需要CoRECT框架来实现一致比较和明智选择，所有代码、数据和结果已开源。

Abstract: Dense retrieval systems have proven to be effective across various
benchmarks, but require substantial memory to store large search indices.
Recent advances in embedding compression show that index sizes can be greatly
reduced with minimal loss in ranking quality. However, existing studies often
overlook the role of corpus complexity -- a critical factor, as recent work
shows that both corpus size and document length strongly affect dense retrieval
performance. In this paper, we introduce CoRECT (Controlled Retrieval
Evaluation of Compression Techniques), a framework for large-scale evaluation
of embedding compression methods, supported by a newly curated dataset
collection. To demonstrate its utility, we benchmark eight representative types
of compression methods. Notably, we show that non-learned compression achieves
substantial index size reduction, even on up to 100M passages, with
statistically insignificant performance loss. However, selecting the optimal
compression method remains challenging, as performance varies across models.
Such variability highlights the necessity of CoRECT to enable consistent
comparison and informed selection of compression methods. All code, data, and
results are available on GitHub and HuggingFace.

Result: 在跨语言信息检索（CLIR）领域评估表明，Top-P动态掩码比Top-K掩码具有更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: Top-P动态掩码是Top-K掩码的有效改进，在跨语言信息检索任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Top-K masking schemes have been proposed as a method to promote sparse
representations in Information Retrieval (IR) tasks, as a simple alternative to
Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPS) regularization. Algorithms such as
Bilingual Lexical and Document Expansion Model (BLADE), adopt this approach as
a post-processing stage. We propose using Top-P Dynamic Masking similar to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解非洲不同国家背景下计算岗位所需能力，以及LLMs在提供职业指导时存在的偏见和局限性。

Method: 使用计算课程2020框架，结合数字殖民主义理论和Ubuntu哲学，分析60个LLM对标准化提示的响应。

Result: 开源模型在9/10国家中得分最高，所有模型平均情境意识仅为35.4%，存在西方中心偏见和基础设施假设问题。

Conclusion: 非洲计算能力要求差异很大，需要在教育中采用去殖民化的AI方法，强调情境相关性。

Abstract: Employers increasingly expect graduates to utilize large language models
(LLMs) in the workplace, yet the competencies needed for computing roles across
Africa remain unclear given varying national contexts. This study examined how
six LLMs, namely ChatGPT 4, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, and Mistral
AI, describe entry-level computing career expectations across ten African
countries. Using the Computing Curricula 2020 framework and drawing on Digital
Colonialism Theory and Ubuntu Philosophy, we analyzed 60 LLM responses to
standardized prompts. Technical skills such as cloud computing and programming
appeared consistently, but notable differences emerged in how models addressed
non-technical competencies, particularly ethics and responsible AI use. Models
varied considerably in recognizing country-specific factors, including local
technology ecosystems, language requirements, and national policies.
Open-source models demonstrated stronger contextual awareness and a better
balance between technical and professional skills, earning top scores in nine
of ten countries. Still, all models struggled with cultural sensitivity and
infrastructure considerations, averaging only 35.4% contextual awareness. This
first broad comparison of LLM career guidance for African computing students
uncovers entrenched infrastructure assumptions and Western-centric biases,
creating gaps between technical recommendations and local needs. The strong
performance of cost-effective open-source models (Llama: 4.47/5; DeepSeek:
4.25/5) compared to proprietary alternatives (ChatGPT 4: 3.90/5; Claude:
3.46/5) challenges assumptions about AI tool quality in resource-constrained
settings. Our findings highlight how computing competency requirements vary
widely across Africa and underscore the need for decolonial approaches to AI in
education that emphasize contextual relevance

Motivation: 计算课程特别是涉及AI/ML公平性和伦理的课程，需要理解如何解决公平结果的障碍，确保期望具有包容性、透明性并促进批判性思维。

Method: 开发了面向公平的评分标准，使用大型语言模型通过多视角角色模拟（教师、系主任、机构评审员、外部评估员）评估24个教学大纲，并识别主题趋势。

Conclusion: 这些见解为改进此类课程中公平、伦理和正义内容的设计和交付提供了具体方向。

Abstract: Course syllabi set the tone and expectations for courses, shaping the
learning experience for both students and instructors. In computing courses,
especially those addressing fairness and ethics in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and algorithmic design, it is imperative that we
understand how approaches to navigating barriers to fair outcomes are being
addressed.These expectations should be inclusive, transparent, and grounded in
promoting critical thinking. Syllabus analysis offers a way to evaluate the
coverage, depth, practices, and expectations within a course. Manual syllabus
evaluation, however, is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. To address
this, we developed a justice-oriented scoring rubric and asked a large language
model (LLM) to review syllabi through a multi-perspective role simulation.
Using this rubric, we evaluated 24 syllabi from four perspectives: instructor,
departmental chair, institutional reviewer, and external evaluator. We also
prompted the LLM to identify thematic trends across the courses. Findings show
that multiperspective evaluation aids us in noting nuanced, role-specific
priorities, leveraging them to fill hidden gaps in curricula design of AI/ML
and related computing courses focused on fairness and ethics. These insights
offer concrete directions for improving the design and delivery of fairness,
ethics, and justice content in such courses.

Motivation: 自然灾害对人类社会造成严重影响，政府面临在有限资源和时间内重建基础设施的挑战。现有规划方法难以同时满足多方利益相关者需求并最大化社会效益。

Method: 使用深度强化学习技术开发REPAIR系统，整合多种深度学习模型和随机智能体作为基线，生成考虑资源、利益相关者需求和城市结构约束的替代重建计划。

Conclusion: REPAIR是一个通用的灾后重建规划工具，可应用于任何规模的区域，帮助决策者制定最优的重建策略。

Abstract: Natural disasters always have several effects on human lives. It is
challenging for governments to tackle these incidents and to rebuild the
economic, social and physical infrastructures and facilities with the available
resources (mainly budget and time). Governments always define plans and
policies according to the law and political strategies that should maximise
social benefits. The severity of damage and the vast resources needed to bring
life back to normality make such reconstruction a challenge. This article is
the extension of our previously published work by conducting comprehensive
comparative analysis by integrating additional deep learning models plus random
agent which is used as a baseline. Our prior research introduced a decision
support system by using the Deep Reinforcement Learning technique for the
planning of post-disaster city reconstruction, maximizing the social benefit of
the reconstruction process, considering available resources, meeting the needs
of the broad community stakeholders (like citizens' social benefits and
politicians' priorities) and keeping in consideration city's structural
constraints (like dependencies among roads and buildings). The proposed
approach, named post disaster REbuilding plAn ProvIdeR (REPAIR) is generic. It
can determine a set of alternative plans for local administrators who select
the ideal one to implement, and it can be applied to areas of any extension. We
show the application of REPAIR in a real use case, i.e., to the L'Aquila
reconstruction process, damaged in 2009 by a major earthquake.

*Aliakbar Mehdizadeh,Martin Hilbert*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM代理在社交网络中的意见更新遵循S型曲线，存在说服不对称性和双重认知层级，不同模型具有不同的从众阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM代理在社交网络中如何受同伴压力影响，以及其意见更新机制与传统从众假设的差异。

Method: 将LLM代理嵌入社交网络，让它们基于同伴观点更新意见，分析不同认知承诺下的行为模式。

Result: 发现代理遵循S型曲线响应，不同模型从众阈值差异显著，存在说服不对称性，形成双重认知层级结构。

Conclusion: LLM代理的决策受流动的、上下文相关的架构支配，而非静态逻辑，为多智能体AI系统的社会认知行为审计提供了新框架。

Abstract: We investigate how peer pressure influences the opinions of Large Language
Model (LLM) agents across a spectrum of cognitive commitments by embedding them
in social networks where they update opinions based on peer perspectives. Our
findings reveal key departures from traditional conformity assumptions. First,
agents follow a sigmoid curve: stable at low pressure, shifting sharply at
threshold, and saturating at high. Second, conformity thresholds vary by model:
Gemini 1.5 Flash requires over 70% peer disagreement to flip, whereas
ChatGPT-4o-mini shifts with a dissenting minority. Third, we uncover a
fundamental "persuasion asymmetry," where shifting an opinion from
affirmative-to-negative requires a different cognitive effort than the reverse.
This asymmetry results in a "dual cognitive hierarchy": the stability of
cognitive constructs inverts based on the direction of persuasion. For
instance, affirmatively-held core values are robust against opposition but
easily adopted from a negative stance, a pattern that inverts for other
constructs like attitudes. These dynamics echoing complex human biases like
negativity bias, prove robust across different topics and discursive frames
(moral, economic, sociotropic). This research introduces a novel framework for
auditing the emergent socio-cognitive behaviors of multi-agent AI systems,
demonstrating their decision-making is governed by a fluid, context-dependent
architecture, not a static logic.

Motivation: AI在STEM教育中的快速集成带来了变革性机遇，但也存在算法偏见、学生隐私侵蚀和教育不平等加剧等伦理挑战，需要建立负责任集成框架。

Method: 通过伦理视角分析AI在STEM课堂的利弊，提出三阶段实施路线图、分层专业发展模型，强调公平中心设计、技术AI素养与伦理推理结合。

Result: 识别了当前AI教育研究的关键空白，特别是缺乏学科特定的负责任集成框架，提出了包含强制性偏见审计、低资源适应策略和政策对齐的关键建议。

Conclusion: 通过连接理论与实践，这项工作推进了以教学完整性、公平性和学生能动性为优先的AI集成研究方法，确保AI成为包容性、以人为本的STEM教育工具。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into K-12 STEM
education presents transformative opportunities alongside significant ethical
challenges. While AI-powered tools such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS),
automated assessments, and predictive analytics enhance personalized learning
and operational efficiency, they also risk perpetuating algorithmic bias,
eroding student privacy, and exacerbating educational inequities. This paper
examines the dual-edged impact of AI in STEM classrooms, analyzing its benefits
(e.g., adaptive learning, real-time feedback) and drawbacks (e.g., surveillance
risks, pedagogical limitations) through an ethical lens. We identify critical
gaps in current AI education research, particularly the lack of
subject-specific frameworks for responsible integration and propose a
three-phased implementation roadmap paired with a tiered professional
development model for educators. Our framework emphasizes equity-centered
design, combining technical AI literacy with ethical reasoning to foster
critical engagement among students. Key recommendations include mandatory bias
audits, low-resource adaptation strategies, and policy alignment to ensure AI
serves as a tool for inclusive, human-centered STEM education. By bridging
theory and practice, this work advances a research-backed approach to AI
integration that prioritizes pedagogical integrity, equity, and student agency
in an increasingly algorithmic world. Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, STEM
education, algorithmic bias, ethical AI, K-12 pedagogy, equity in education

Abstract: This study presents a design science blueprint for an orchestrated AI
assistant and co-pilot in doctoral supervision that acts as a socio-technical
mediator. Design requirements are derived from Stakeholder Theory and bounded
by Academic Integrity. We consolidated recent evidence on supervision gaps and
student wellbeing, then mapped issues to adjacent large language model
capabilities using a transparent severity-mitigability triage. The artefact
assembles existing capabilities into one accountable agentic AI workflow that
proposes retrieval-augmented generation and temporal knowledge graphs, as well
as mixture-of-experts routing as a solution stack of technologies to address
existing doctoral supervision pain points. Additionally, a student context
store is proposed, which introduces behaviour patches that turn tacit guidance
into auditable practice and student-set thresholds that trigger progress
summaries, while keeping authorship and final judgement with people. We specify
a student-initiated moderation loop in which assistant outputs are routed to a
supervisor for review and patching, and we analyse a reconfigured stakeholder
ecosystem that makes information explicit and accountable. Risks in such a
system exist, and among others, include AI over-reliance and the potential for
the illusion of learning, while guardrails are proposed. The contribution is an
ex ante, literature-grounded design with workflow and governance rules that
institutions can implement and trial across disciplines.

Conclusion: 多模态基础能更好地捕捉人类注意力和决策的细微差别，为构建高效有效的人类行为模拟器提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLMs have recently demonstrated strong potential in simulating online shopper
behavior. Prior work has improved action prediction by applying SFT on action
traces with LLM-generated rationales, and by leveraging RL to further enhance
reasoning capabilities. Despite these advances, current approaches rely on
text-based inputs and overlook the essential role of visual perception in
shaping human decision-making during web GUI interactions. In this paper, we
investigate the integration of visual information, specifically webpage
screenshots, into behavior simulation via VLMs, leveraging OPeRA dataset. By
grounding agent decision-making in both textual and visual modalities, we aim
to narrow the gap between synthetic agents and real-world users, thereby
enabling more cognitively aligned simulations of online shopping behavior.
Specifically, we employ SFT for joint action prediction and rationale
generation, conditioning on the full interaction context, which comprises
action history, past HTML observations, and the current webpage screenshot. To
further enhance reasoning capabilities, we integrate RL with a hierarchical
reward structure, scaled by a difficulty-aware factor that prioritizes
challenging decision points. Empirically, our studies show that incorporating
visual grounding yields substantial gains: the combination of text and image
inputs improves exact match accuracy by more than 6% over text-only inputs.
These results indicate that multi-modal grounding not only boosts predictive
accuracy but also enhances simulation fidelity in visually complex
environments, which captures nuances of human attention and decision-making
that text-only agents often miss. Finally, we revisit the design space of
behavior simulation frameworks, identify key methodological limitations, and
propose future research directions toward building efficient and effective
human behavior simulators.

Result: 在税收政策设计、团队协调和设施选址等多样化场景中，SWM-AP在累积奖励和样本效率方面优于现有模型

Conclusion: 社会世界模型为异构复杂系统中的机制设计提供了有效途径

Abstract: Designing adaptive mechanisms to align individual and collective interests
remains a central challenge in artificial social intelligence. Existing methods
often struggle with modeling heterogeneous agents possessing persistent latent
traits (e.g., skills, preferences) and dealing with complex multi-agent system
dynamics. These challenges are compounded by the critical need for high sample
efficiency due to costly real-world interactions. World Models, by learning to
predict environmental dynamics, offer a promising pathway to enhance mechanism
design in heterogeneous and complex systems. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method named SWM-AP (Social World Model-Augmented Mechanism Design Policy
Learning), which learns a social world model hierarchically modeling agents'
behavior to enhance mechanism design. Specifically, the social world model
infers agents' traits from their interaction trajectories and learns a
trait-based model to predict agents' responses to the deployed mechanisms. The
mechanism design policy collects extensive training trajectories by interacting
with the social world model, while concurrently inferring agents' traits online
during real-world interactions to further boost policy learning efficiency.
Experiments in diverse settings (tax policy design, team coordination, and
facility location) demonstrate that SWM-AP outperforms established model-based
and model-free RL baselines in cumulative rewards and sample efficiency.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何将AI整合到设计教育中，使学生不仅将AI视为自动化工具，而是能够批判性使用、识别幻觉并进行选择性不使用的创新伙伴。

Method: 在13周的设计课程中，要求学生通过工具-队友-不使用三分类框架反思AI使用，收集了13份结构化反思表格、8份图示简报以及教师研究笔记，进行定性编码分析。

Result: 学生不仅利用Gen-AI加速原型设计和技能获取，还学会了拒绝AI输出、发明幻觉识别演练，并将节省的时间用于更深度的用户研究，将效率转化为创新。

Conclusion: 通过工具访问、反思、角色标记和竞赛奖励的协调组合，可以在教育中规模化AI创新应用而不损害问责制，奖励选择性不使用能培养幻觉感知的工作流程。

Abstract: This pilot study traces students' reflections on the use of AI in a 13-week
foundational design course enrolling over 500 first-year engineering and
architecture students at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. The
course was an AI-enhanced design course, with several interventions to equip
students with AI based design skills. Students were required to reflect on
whether the technology was used as a tool (instrumental assistant), a teammate
(collaborative partner), or neither (deliberate non-use). By foregrounding this
three-way lens, students learned to use AI for innovation rather than just
automation and to reflect on agency, ethics, and context rather than on prompt
crafting alone. Evidence stems from coursework artefacts: thirteen structured
reflection spreadsheets and eight illustrated briefs submitted, combined with
notes of teachers and researchers. Qualitative coding of these materials
reveals shared practices brought about through the inclusion of Gen-AI,
including accelerated prototyping, rapid skill acquisition, iterative prompt
refinement, purposeful "switch-offs" during user research, and emergent
routines for recognizing hallucinations. Unexpectedly, students not only
harnessed Gen-AI for speed but (enabled by the tool-teammate-neither triage)
also learned to reject its outputs, invent their own hallucination fire-drills,
and divert the reclaimed hours into deeper user research, thereby transforming
efficiency into innovation. The implications of the approach we explore shows
that: we can transform AI uptake into an assessable design habit; that
rewarding selective non-use cultivates hallucination-aware workflows; and,
practically, that a coordinated bundle of tool access, reflection, role
tagging, and public recognition through competition awards allows AI based
innovation in education to scale without compromising accountability.

Motivation: 基于自我决定理论，研究从AI工具使用者转变为设计者如何影响学生的学习体验、身份认同和知识参与。

Method: 在两学期课程中，学生先使用教师创建的GPT进行定性研究，后重新设计工具创建自己的定制应用，通过学生演示和焦点小组访谈进行定性主题分析。

Result: 学生在角色和心态上发生显著转变，感到更自主、更有能力、与同伴联系更紧密，获得了AI相关技能。

Conclusion: 学生参与技术共同设计能有效激活学生能动性，将其从技术消费者转变为知识共同创造者。

Abstract: This study explores how graduate students in an urban planning program
transitioned from passive users of generative AI to active creators of custom
GPT-based knowledge tools. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which
emphasizes the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness as
foundations for intrinsic motivation, the research investigates how the act of
designing AI tools influences students' learning experiences, identity
formation, and engagement with knowledge. The study is situated within a
two-term curriculum, where students first used instructor-created GPTs to
support qualitative research tasks and later redesigned these tools to create
their own custom applications, including the Interview Companion GPT. Using
qualitative thematic analysis of student slide presentations and focus group
interviews, the findings highlight a marked transformation in students' roles
and mindsets. Students reported feeling more autonomous as they chose the
functionality, design, and purpose of their tools, more competent through the
acquisition of AI-related skills such as prompt engineering and iterative
testing, and more connected to peers through team collaboration and a shared
sense of purpose. The study contributes to a growing body of evidence that
student agency can be powerfully activated when learners are invited to
co-design the very technologies they use. The shift from AI tool users to AI
tool designers reconfigures students' relationships with technology and
knowledge, transforming them from consumers into co-creators in an evolving
educational landscape.

Motivation: 揭示数字平台工作的复杂本质，批判其加剧经济剥削、职业隔离和工作条件恶化的问题，特别关注算法管理对边缘群体的不平等影响，以及资本主义体系中的权力失衡。

Method: 基于女权主义理论，构建包含四个关键维度的分析框架：(i)不稳定性和剥削，(ii)监控与控制，(iii)就业边界模糊化，(iv)殖民遗留问题。

Result: 提出了一个系统性分析数字平台工作的理论框架，识别了平台经济中的核心问题和权力结构。

Conclusion: 需要参与式研究方法、平台治理透明化以及结构性改革，以促进数字平台工作者更公平的工作条件。

Abstract: The rapid growth of the digital platform economy is transforming labor
markets, offering new employment opportunities with promises of flexibility and
accessibility. However, these benefits often come at the expense of increased
economic exploitation, occupational segregation, and deteriorating working
conditions. Research highlights that algorithmic management disproportionately
impacts marginalized groups, reinforcing gendered and racial inequalities while
deepening power imbalances within capitalist systems. This study seeks to
elucidate the complex nature of digital platform work by drawing on feminist
theories that have historically scrutinized and contested the structures of
power within society, especially in the workplace. It presents a framework
focused on four key dimensions to lay a foundation for future research: (i)
precarity and exploitation, (ii) surveillance and control, (iii) blurring
employment boundaries, and (iv) colonial legacies. It advocates for
participatory research, transparency in platform governance, and structural
changes to promote more equitable conditions for digital platform workers.

Method: 基于跨文化心理学、数字伦理和社会技术系统理论，使用来自欧洲、非洲、亚洲和南美洲9个国家21名参与者的调查数据，分析人口统计学变量和文化取向对AI信任、伦理接受度和依赖度的影响。

Result: 1. 文化因素特别是语言和年龄显著影响AI采用和可靠性认知，年长参与者更倾向于在教育目的中使用AI；2. AI使用的伦理判断在不同领域存在差异，专业环境将其视为实用合作者，而学术环境更关注抄袭风险。

Conclusion: AI使用既非普遍也非中立，而是文化依赖、领域特定和伦理情境化的，研究强调了在教育、专业实践和全球技术政策中开发文化适应且伦理稳健的AI使用方式的重要性。

Abstract: The swift diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) raises critical questions
about how cultural contexts shape adoption patterns and their consequences for
human daily life. This study investigates the cultural dimensions of AI
adoption and their influence on cognitive strategies across nine national
contexts in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America. Drawing on survey data
from a diverse pilot sample (n = 21) and guided by cross-cultural psychology,
digital ethics, and sociotechnical systems theory, we examine how demographic
variables (age, gender, professional role) and cultural orientations (language,
values, and institutional exposure) mediate perceptions of trust, ethical
acceptability, and reliance on AI. Results reveal two key findings: First,
cultural factors, particularly language and age, significantly affect AI
adoption and perceptions of reliability with older participants reporting
higher engagement with AI for educational purposes. Second, ethical judgment
about AI use varied across domains, with professional contexts normalizing its
role as a pragmatic collaborator while academic settings emphasized risks of
plagiarism. These findings extend prior research on culture and technology
adoption by demonstrating that AI use is neither universal nor neutral but
culturally contingent, domain-specific, and ethically situated. The study
highlights implications for AI use in education, professional practice, and
global technology policy, pointing at actions that enable usage of AI in a way
that is both culturally adaptive and ethically robust.

Conclusion: 记者以受监督的方式预期和整合AI技术，通过"受控变革"策略维护专业权威，确保AI使用符合新闻伦理标准。

Abstract: Using (generative) artificial intelligence tools and systems in journalism is
expected to increase journalists' production rates, transform newsrooms'
economic models, and further personalize the audience's news consumption
practices. Since its release in 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT and other large language
models have raised the alarms inside news organizations, not only for bringing
new challenges to news reporting and fact-checking but also for what these
technologies would mean for journalists' professional authority in journalism.
This paper examines how journalists in Dutch media manage the integration of AI
technologies into their daily routines. Drawing from 13 interviews with
editors, journalists, and innovation managers in different news outlets and
media companies, we propose the concept of controlled change. as a heuristic to
explain how journalists are proactively setting guidelines, experimenting with
AI tools, and identifying their limitations and capabilities. Using
professional authority as a theoretical framework, we argue that journalists
anticipate and integrate AI technologies in a supervised manner and identify
three primary mechanisms through which journalists manage this integration: (1)
developing adaptive guidelines that align AI use with ethical codes, (2)
experimenting with AI technologies to determine their necessity and fit, and
(3) critically assessing the capabilities and limitations of AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共和非营利组织对采用AI工具犹豫不决，因为大多数模型不透明，且标准方法通常分析聚合模式而非提供可操作的具体案例指导。

Method: 采用实践者参与循环工作流程，构建可解释的决策树模型识别关键预测因子，然后将树结构提供给LLM，使其能够基于透明模型生成案例级预测。实践者参与特征工程、模型设计、解释审查和可用性评估全过程。

Result: 结果表明，整合透明模型、LLMs和实践者输入能够产生准确、可信且可操作的案例级评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为公共和非营利部门负责任地采用AI提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because
most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze
aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This
study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent
decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive
accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using
data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision
trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an
LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the
transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering,
model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field
expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating
transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy,
and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for
responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析验证式测试时扩展中生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的相互作用，揭示了次优性-覆盖率曲线的三个机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然带验证的测试时扩展在提升大语言模型性能方面显示出潜力，但验证器的作用及其不完美性仍未得到充分探索。现有研究只捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏量化它们相互作用几何特性的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证的测试时扩展构建为传输问题，通过理论分析揭示覆盖率、收敛区域和次优性之间的相互作用，并提出和分析两类采样算法——顺序和批量采样。

Result: 发现次优性-覆盖率曲线呈现三个机制：传输机制（次优性随覆盖率增加而增加）、策略改进机制（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和机制（次优性趋于平稳，不受覆盖率影响）。实证结果与Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过传输问题框架统一量化了验证式测试时扩展中关键因素的相互作用，为理解和优化大语言模型的测试时扩展提供了理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 现有机器学习诊断方法依赖静态数据集，无法模拟临床医生在实践中的顺序性、资源感知推理过程。诊断在高压或资源有限环境中仍然复杂且容易出错，需要能够帮助医生及时做出成本效益决策的框架。

Method: 将贝叶斯实验设计与大型语言模型集成，LLMs作为灵活模拟器生成合理的患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需结构化任务特定训练数据。医生可参与审查测试建议、解释中间输出并应用临床判断。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的评估显示，ACTMED能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源利用效率。

Conclusion: 该框架代表了向透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统迈出的一步，能够在减少对领域特定数据依赖的情况下跨环境泛化。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

### [190] [Rectifying Shortcut Behaviors in Preference-based Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19050)
*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出PRISM方法，通过组不变核学习来缓解基于偏好的奖励模型中的捷径行为问题，提高奖励模型在分布外任务上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的强化学习中，偏好奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击和泛化能力不足的问题，模型会利用训练数据中的伪特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）来获取高奖励分数，而非真正反映预期目标。

Method: 受核视角不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，通过闭式学习目标学习具有特征映射的组不变核，缓解偏好奖励学习中的捷径行为。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法一致提高了奖励模型在分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个鲁棒的框架，能有效缓解奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

*Brandon James Carone,Iran R. Roman,Pablo Ripollés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUSE基准测试评估多模态大语言模型的音乐理解能力，发现现有模型在关系推理方面存在严重缺陷，与人类专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在音频理解方面的评估可能掩盖了其在关系推理方面的根本弱点，需要更深入的音乐感知技能评估。

Method: 开发了MUSE基准测试，包含10个任务来探测基础音乐感知技能，评估了4个SOTA模型并与200名人类专家进行对比。

Result: SOTA模型能力差异显著，与人类专家存在持续差距。Gemini Pro在基础感知上表现良好，但Qwen和Audio Flamingo 3表现接近随机水平，暴露严重感知缺陷。思维链提示效果不一致且往往有害。

Conclusion: MUSE基准为评估不变音乐表示提供了关键工具，将推动开发更鲁棒的AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型在临床试验报告CONSORT标准评估中的表现，发现不同模型和提示条件在推理风格、不确定性表达和解释策略上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医疗领域快速扩展，但其按照CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力仍不明确，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证数据，系统比较两种代表性LLMs在三种提示条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在处理不同CONSORT项目和提示类型时表现出明显差异，包括推理风格转变、显式不确定性和替代解释策略。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，并强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

### [193] [The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176)
*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出模式选择作为早期退出的更具挑战性变体，旨在通过零步思维在推理过程开始时决定使用长链思维还是短链思维，以减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但逐步思考过程常导致过度思考和不必要的计算开销。模式选择和早期退出都旨在减轻这种计算负担。

Method: 将模式选择识别为早期退出的更困难变体，需要在推理过程开始时基于预定义的虚假思维做出决策，而无需显式推理过程（零步思维）。通过九个基线方法的实证研究，比较了提示方法和利用内部信息的方法。

Result: 提示方法由于在提供有限手工制作信息时分类能力有限而经常失败。利用内部信息的方法在大多数场景中表现更好，但仍存在稳定性问题。现有方法仅依赖模型提供的信息不足以有效解决信息有限场景下的模式选择问题。

Conclusion: 模式选择是早期退出的更具挑战性变体，现有方法在信息有限场景下仍面临困难，凸显了该任务的持续挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebGraphEval是一个将多个智能体的网页交互轨迹抽象为统一加权动作图的框架，用于超越传统二元成功指标的网页智能体评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页智能体评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中存在的结构多样性问题。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，兼容WebArena等基准，无需修改环境。框架规范编码动作、合并重复行为，并应用奖励传播和成功加权边统计等结构分析。

Result: 在来自六个网页智能体的数千条轨迹评估中，图抽象捕捉了跨模型规律性，突出了冗余和低效行为，并识别了基于结果指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网页交互构建为图结构数据，WebGraphEval建立了多路径、跨智能体和效率感知的网页智能体评估通用方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过法律领域的实验评估ChatGPT性能，与正则表达式基线对比，发现ChatGPT即使具备必要知识也无法整合推理得出全面结果，揭示了其在复杂问题分解和综合解决能力上的重大局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在法律领域的实际表现，特别关注其能否像人类一样整合多种能力来解决复杂问题，而不仅仅是与人类表现对比。

Method: 通过法律决策文本分析实验，比较ChatGPT与正则表达式方法在提取法律原则关键段落任务上的表现。

Result: ChatGPT无法有效整合知识和能力进行推理，无法提供统一全面的解决方案，在法律原则提取任务中表现不如预期。

Conclusion: 真正的智能仍然是人类独有的特质，至少在法律领域，人工智能缺乏全面理解和推理能力，存在固有局限性。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了推导状态论证框架，为容纳不一致先例的广义理由模型提供论证性解释方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统先例推理假设先例集合必须一致，但广义理由模型放宽了这一假设。目前缺乏针对这种容纳不一致先例的广义推理框架的论证性解释方法

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架，以解释基于广义理由模型的推理

Result: 开发了能够解释广义理由模型推理的论证框架

Conclusion: 成功将论证性解释方法扩展到容纳不一致先例的广义推理框架中

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，通过行为奖励函数和情境学习来研究LLM智能体是否能复现人类在线社交动态，包括同质性、互惠性和社会验证等特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型智能体是否能复现人类在线社交的复杂动态，探索哪些记忆和学习机制能够促成这种动态的出现。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过重复互动、相互评估和情境学习来适应行为，使用捕捉在线参与核心驱动因素的行为奖励函数，包括社交互动、信息寻求、自我呈现、协调和情感支持。

Result: 实验表明，经过指导的LLM智能体发展出稳定的互动模式并形成涌现的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能体如何近似或偏离类人社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了CKA-RL方法，通过持续知识适应策略和自适应知识合并机制，解决持续强化学习中的灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: CKA-RL包含持续知识适应策略（维护任务特定知识向量池并动态使用历史知识）和自适应知识合并机制（合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求）。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL优于最先进方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过有效积累和利用历史知识，成功解决了持续强化学习中的关键挑战，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个用于评估LLM代理在多跳、端到端工具编排能力的大规模基准测试，通过构建"同等功能集"作为真实基准，减少对LLM作为评判的依赖，并系统性地测试从单工具编排到跨服务器规划的代理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常在孤立环境中评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估结果过于乐观。MSC-Bench旨在填补这些空白，提供更客观的评估框架。

Method: 采用五级课程结构，从单工具编排逐步测试到复杂跨服务器规划，并通过"同等功能集"构建真实基准，使用F1分数等客观指标进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，僵化的层次结构会阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架，能够暴露现有代理的局限性，并指导开发更强大、高效的工具使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个神经符号程序化框架，通过将符号规划转化为可组合的程序表示，使语言模型在受限环境中具备高效推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在动态环境中执行具身任务时，因延迟、连接性和资源限制而无法实时访问大规模推理引擎或符号规划器的问题。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定规划，然后将这些规划转化为编码隐含生产规则的可组合程序表示，最后将这些程序无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr相比大规模推理模型和符号规划器展现出更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化能够将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象为单步语言模型推理，适合在延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统中部署。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致语言条件任务中存在显著歧义，严重影响算法性能，需要解决指令歧义问题。

Method: 提出DAIL方法，包含两个关键组件：分布策略（通过价值分布估计机制增强任务可区分性）和语义对齐模块（捕捉轨迹与语言指令之间的对应关系）。

Result: 在结构和视觉观察基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明，DAIL能有效解决指令歧义问题。

Conclusion: DAIL方法通过分布对齐学习有效处理语言指令的歧义，实现了优于基线方法的性能。

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电子商务基准，要求代理根据商品描述预测10位HS编码，现有最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准忽视了深度搜索代理应用复杂规则（如法律条款、关税规则）的关键能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐式逻辑关系，应用难度大。

Method: 从大型电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个商品条目，涵盖多样化品类，HS编码由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进LLM和代理上的实验显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%，测试时扩展也无法提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对现有代理构成重大挑战，需要开发更强大的规则理解和应用能力。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市感知系统在多样化城市场景中泛化能力有限，决策过程缺乏可解释性，需要开发更适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好的解决方案。

Method: 使用经典规划器生成基线解决方案，然后通过多智能体进化系统迭代优化，使感知任务分配适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好，同时生成自然语言解释。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性上表现更好。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署自适应和可解释城市感知系统的重要进展，为基于web的城市管理提供了更透明和可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

### [205] [Explainable e-sports win prediction through Machine Learning classification in streaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19671)
*Silvia García-Méndez,Francisco de Arriba-Pérez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解释的电子竞技流式胜率预测分类解决方案，通过滑动窗口控制输入数据来反映游戏变化，准确率超过90%，超越了现有解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电子竞技观众和玩家数量的增长，以及优化通信解决方案和云计算技术的发展，在线游戏行业持续增长。虽然基于人工智能的电子竞技分析传统上被定义为从相关数据中提取有意义的模式并进行可视化以增强决策，但专业胜率预测的大部分工作都集中在批量分类方面，同时忽略了可视化技术。

Method: 提出了一种可解释的胜率预测分类解决方案，在流式处理中通过多个滑动窗口控制输入数据，以反映相关的游戏变化。

Result: 实验结果显示准确率超过90%，超越了文献中竞争解决方案的性能。

Conclusion: 该系统可被排名和推荐系统利用，用于知情决策，这得益于可解释性模块，该模块促进了对结果预测的信任。

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

### [206] [RLIE: Rule Generation with Logistic Regression, Iterative Refinement, and Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19698)
*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE是一个将大语言模型与概率建模相结合的统一框架，通过四个阶段学习加权规则集，直接应用学习到的权重规则比将规则注入LLM的方法表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法忽略了规则间的交互作用，且未充分利用LLM与概率规则学习的结合潜力，需要开发更可靠的神经符号推理方法。

Method: 四阶段框架：1) LLM生成和筛选候选规则；2) 逻辑回归学习概率权重；3) 基于预测误差迭代优化规则集；4) 评估加权规则集作为直接分类器的性能。

Result: 直接应用学习到的权重规则表现优异，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出注入LLM提示反而降低准确性，表明LLM擅长语义生成但不适合精确概率集成。

Conclusion: RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，将其与经典概率规则组合方法结合，可实现更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

### [207] [Memo: Training Memory-Efficient Embodied Agents with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19732)
*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一个基于transformer的架构和训练方法，用于内存密集型、长时程强化学习任务。它通过插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，在计算和存储效率上优于长上下文transformer基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的具身智能体策略训练中，视觉输入常常超出transformer的上下文限制，而人类能够维护和利用压缩为记忆的终身经验。现有方法主要关注固定大小内存的循环模型或完全依赖上下文的transformer。

Method: 提出Memo架构，在训练期间通过周期性插入总结标记与模型输入交错，实现记忆的创建和检索。

Result: 在网格世界元强化学习基准和照片级真实室内环境的多目标导航任务中，Memo优于朴素的长上下文transformer基线，同时在计算和存储上更高效。

Conclusion: Memo在推理时能更好地泛化到更长上下文，并在流式设置中保持鲁棒性，当历史上下文必须被截断以适应推理约束时仍能有效工作。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PROBE基准来评估LLM智能体的主动性能力，将主动性分解为三个核心能力：搜索未指定问题、识别具体瓶颈和执行适当解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准受限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 设计PROBE基准，将主动性分解为三个核心能力管道，并应用于评估领先的LLM和流行智能体框架。

Result: 即使是当前最先进的模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%，揭示了智能体系统的局限性。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统中自主行动的当前局限性，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

TL;DR: 提出了WorldTest评估协议和AutumnBench测试套件，用于评估模型学习智能体在开放环境中的世界模型学习能力，强调奖励无关的探索和多任务测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型学习和评估方法过于依赖下一帧预测和相同环境中的奖励最大化，无法真正评估模型对环境动态的理解能力。

Method: 设计WorldTest协议：奖励无关交互阶段+不同但相关环境中的评分测试阶段；创建AutumnBench套件，包含43个网格世界环境和129个任务，涵盖掩码帧预测、规划和因果动态变化预测。

Result: 人类参与者表现优于前沿模型；计算规模扩展只在某些环境中提升性能；AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习的显著提升空间。

Conclusion: WorldTest为评估智能体对环境动态的学习提供了新模板，AutumnBench展示了世界模型学习的巨大改进潜力。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.
