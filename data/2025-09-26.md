TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于下一个标记概率（NTPs）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来检测视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的幻觉问题，该方法计算效率高且性能可与强VLMs相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的幻觉问题（视觉内容与生成文本之间的不匹配）严重影响了模型的可靠性。现有的检测方法通常使用相同或不同的VLM来评估生成输出，但这种方法计算密集且会增加模型延迟。

Method: 研究探索了一种高效的实时幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型基于VLM的下一个标记概率（NTPs）信号进行检测。NTPs提供了模型不确定性的直接量化，假设高不确定性（即低NTP值）与幻觉密切相关。此外，还引入了仅将生成文本反馈到VLM中计算的语言NTPs来增强检测性能。

Result: 基于1,400个人工标注的VLM生成内容数据集测试，结果表明NTP-based特征是幻觉的有价值预测因子，使简单ML模型能达到强VLMs的性能水平。将语言NTPs与视觉NTPs结合能进一步提升检测性能，而将VLM的幻觉预测分数集成到NTP-based模型中能获得比单独使用VLM或NTPs更好的性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发简单、轻量级的解决方案铺平了道路，有助于增强视觉语言模型的可靠性。NTP-based方法提供了一种计算效率高的替代方案，有望在实际应用中提高VLM的可信度。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于解决离线手写签名验证在独立于书写者场景下的泛化问题，通过SPD矩阵空间生成合成数据来训练分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在独立于书写者设置下具有挑战性，现有方法通常依赖真实数据集进行训练。本文旨在利用黎曼几何生成合成数据来减少对真实数据的依赖。

Method: 基于对称正定矩阵（SPD）的黎曼几何，使用少量真实样本作为种子，通过黎曼高斯混合模型识别合成书写者中心，并在每个中心进行黎曼高斯采样生成正负样本，最后使用度量学习框架。

Result: 在两个包含西方和亚洲书写风格的流行签名数据集上的实验表明，该方法在数据集内和跨数据集评估协议下都能实现低错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在黎曼空间中生成合成数据用于独立于书写者的签名验证系统的潜力，能够有效减少对真实训练数据的依赖。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，集成了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，采用高效的扩散变换器和强大的VAE，能够快速生成高分辨率图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合统一到单一框架中，扩展传统T2I系统为更具交互性和多维度的创意工具。

Method: 开发高效的扩散变换器和强大的VAE减少图像令牌数量，采用多模态后训练联合训练T2I和图像编辑任务，集成对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码进行推理加速。

Result: 在生成2K图像时推理时间可达1.8秒，在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平，在复杂任务中展示出色的多模态能力。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统T2I系统扩展为更具交互性和多维度的创意工具，推动了生成AI在创意和专业应用领域的边界。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的半监督框架，用于乳腺癌检测，在有限标注数据情况下实现了96.7%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测对治疗至关重要。深度学习虽然有效，但受限于标注数据不足的问题。

Method: 使用Resnet-50在对比学习框架下进行半监督训练，利用大量未标注乳腺X光片数据，通过相似性指标和各种数据增强技术提升性能。

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架能够有效解决乳腺癌检测中标注数据不足的问题，为早期诊断提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文测试了基础模型在工业质量检测中的应用，发现虽然基础模型在公开数据集上表现良好，但在真实工业数据上全部失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础模型的零样本泛化能力替代繁琐的人工标注，实现跨产品的自动化质量检测，以节省模型部署和实施的巨大工作量。

Method: 在定制真实工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个最新基础模型，比较它们在两种数据集上的性能表现。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上都失败了，而同样的模型在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在工业质量检测场景中的实际应用仍面临挑战，需要针对工业环境的特定优化。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

### [6] [Shared Neural Space: Unified Precomputed Feature Encoding for Multi-Task and Cross Domain Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20481)
*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的神经空间（NS），通过编码器-解码器框架预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，使多个下游AI模块能够共享相同的特征空间，从而提高效率并改善跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数AI模型都是针对特定高精度任务定制的，这在需要执行一系列模块化任务的应用中效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 采用轻量级CNN骨干网络的编码器-解码器框架，学习具有变换感知和泛化能力的表示，构建通用神经空间，多个下游任务在此共享特征空间。

Result: 实验表明，成像和视觉模块（如去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割）可以在神经空间中高效执行，减少了冗余并改善了跨域泛化。

Conclusion: 该架构为高效的多任务视觉管道奠定了基础，相比大型transformer骨干网络，轻量级CNN骨干网络具有更广泛的硬件适应性。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何在边缘摄像头系统中高效选择训练图像，通过高置信度流策略和多样性方法，在保持低传输成本的同时最大化模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘摄像头系统需要定期更新模型，但受限于计算资源和传输成本，需要选择最有用的图像进行训练。

Method: 采用高置信度流策略结合多样性方法，在相似训练负载下，通过最小化数据集查询来优化模型训练。

Result: 该方法能够产生高质量的模型，同时保持最小的数据集查询量。

Conclusion: 高置信度流策略与多样性方法结合是边缘设备模型训练的有效解决方案，能够在有限资源下实现最佳性能。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言实现精细和复杂的风格控制，无需手动绘制精确的掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法存在局限性：生成理想结果的掩码困难、需要专业知识、模型依赖性强，且无法处理某些复杂场景（如卷起袖子等风格变化）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本风格指令，实现多轮图像生成的自动化执行。

Result: InstructVTON与现有虚拟试穿模型兼容，实现了最先进的结果和风格控制能力。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了终端用户体验，消除了精确绘制掩码的必要性，并能处理传统掩码方法无法实现的试穿场景。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

TL;DR: 本文分析了社区贡献平台（如Kaggle和HuggingFace）上公开可用的医学影像数据集，发现当前CCP治理模式在数据共享、文档记录和评估方面存在质量问题，可能导致下游有害影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据集对医疗AI至关重要，但当前社区贡献平台的治理模式未能维持数据质量标准和推荐实践，需要分析公开数据集的问题和局限性。

Method: 对CCPs上公开可用的机器学习数据集进行分析，比较数据共享、数据文档和维护等多个维度，识别当前CCP环境中的局限性和差距。

Result: 发现数据集存在模糊许可证、缺乏持久标识符和存储、重复数据、缺失元数据等问题，不同平台之间存在差异，医学影像数据集与计算机视觉数据集在潜在危害方面存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了负责任数据管理和医疗AI算法的重要性，为改进社区贡献平台的数据治理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个深度学习模型，用于识别被篡改的指纹，在三个难度级别上分别达到96.7%、98.76%和99.54%的准确率，但阈值选择对性能影响很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边境控制、法医学和财政准入等应用中，对手可能故意修改指纹脊线模式以逃避检测，因此需要能够识别被篡改指纹的鲁棒验证系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered数据集的三个难度级别上进行评估。

Result: 在严格阈值下，三个难度级别的准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%；但当阈值从0.92放宽到0.72时，准确率急剧下降到7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明其已准备好用于需要安全性和识别弹性的实际部署场景。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: Datasets play a critical role in medical imaging research, yet issues such as
label quality, shortcuts, and metadata are often overlooked. This lack of
attention may harm the generalizability of algorithms and, consequently,
negatively impact patient outcomes. While existing medical imaging literature
reviews mostly focus on machine learning (ML) methods, with only a few focusing
on datasets for specific applications, these reviews remain static -- they are
published once and not updated thereafter. This fails to account for emerging
evidence, such as biases, shortcuts, and additional annotations that other
researchers may contribute after the dataset is published. We refer to these
newly discovered findings of datasets as research artifacts. To address this
gap, we propose a living review that continuously tracks public datasets and
their associated research artifacts across multiple medical imaging
applications. Our approach includes a framework for the living review to
monitor data documentation artifacts, and an SQL database to visualize the
citation relationships between research artifact and dataset. Lastly, we
discuss key considerations for creating medical imaging datasets, review best
practices for data annotation, discuss the significance of shortcuts and
demographic diversity, and emphasize the importance of managing datasets
throughout their entire lifecycle. Our demo is publicly available at

Motivation: 利用自监督ViT模型的注意力图作为像素级显著性分数，为机器人操作提供语义线索

Method: 从DINOv2提取注意力图，将其提升到3D体素网格中，并集成到行为克隆策略中

Result: 在RLBench双手基准测试中，平均绝对提升8.2%，相对增益21.9%

Conclusion: 注意力引导的特征化方法能显著提升体素基策略的双手操作性能

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic

self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

Conclusion: 中等规模模型在精度和速度之间提供了良好平衡，半监督学习能进一步提升检测性能，但需要更深入研究以更好地利用跨域未标注数据。数据集和软件程序已公开以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

### [14] [Region-of-Interest Augmentation for Mammography Classification under Patient-Level Cross-Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20585)
*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的感兴趣区域（ROI）增强策略，通过在训练时概率性地用预计算的ROI裁剪替换完整图像，来提升乳腺X光片分类性能，而无需额外标签或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查对早期检测和降低死亡率至关重要，但深度学习在自动化解读方面受限于低分辨率数据集和小样本量。

Method: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，训练时以概率p_roi用随机ROI裁剪替换完整图像，这些裁剪来自预计算的无标签边界框库，可选抖动增加变异性。

Result: 在严格的患者级交叉验证下，ROI增强（最佳参数p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10）带来适度的平均ROC-AUC提升，但性能因折叠而异；PR-AUC持平或略降。

Conclusion: 简单的、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在受限设置中增强乳腺X光分类，且推理成本不变。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用镜像反射作为辅助视图，通过设计变换构建物理有效的虚拟相机，实现单图像多视角立体视觉，简化成像过程并兼容前馈重建模型，实现通用且鲁棒的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常环境中常见的镜像反射可以在单次拍摄中提供立体信息，因为真实视图和反射的虚拟视图同时可见。利用这一特性可以简化3D重建过程。

Method: 将反射视为辅助视图，设计变换构建物理有效的虚拟相机，直接生成像素域虚拟视图；提出对称感知损失来优化姿态估计；框架可自然扩展到动态场景。

Result: 提供了包含16个Blender场景的完全可定制合成数据集，每个场景都有真实点云和相机姿态；在真实世界和合成数据上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张包含镜像的图像实现多视角立体视觉，简化成像过程，实现通用且鲁棒的3D重建，特别适用于动态场景的逐帧几何恢复。

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: FacadeTrack是一个街景级别的语言引导框架，用于灾后建筑占用评估，通过全景视频与地块关联、立面校正和可解释属性分析，提供透明的一阶段规则和两阶段决策策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后建筑占用评估对于分类、检查、公用事业恢复和资源分配至关重要。高空影像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景影像有细节但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 提出FacadeTrack框架：链接全景视频到地块，校正立面视图，提取可解释属性（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用一阶段规则和两阶段决策策略（感知与保守推理分离）。

Result: 在两次飓风Helene后的调查中，两阶段方法达到精度0.927、召回率0.781、F1分数0.848；一阶段基线为精度0.943、召回率0.728、F1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示了错误来源。

Conclusion: 该管道提供可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，通过针对性质量控制提高准确性。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨人类如何通过简单的移动形状识别社会互动，发现语义表征（特别是动词嵌入）比视觉特征更能解释人类的相似性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从简单的移动形状中识别社会互动，但以往研究多关注视觉特征，本研究旨在探索人类使用哪些语义表征来补充视觉特征。

Method: 研究1：让参与者直接标记动画印象；研究2：通过人类相似性判断测量27种社会互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征之外的补充信息，其中基于动画描述的动词嵌入最能解释人类的相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社会感知反映了社会互动的语义结构，在视觉和抽象表征之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在严重的外观变化下缺乏鲁棒性，难以实现跨域泛化，且无法同时建立可靠的全局和局部对应关系。

Method: 使用E(2)-Steerable CNN编码器提取旋转和视角变化下的稳定特征，构建带有虚拟超级节点的图结构，实现全局语义的聚合和局部重分配。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试中取得显著性能提升，建立了跨域CVGL的新state-of-the-art。

Conclusion: EGS框架通过结合E(2)-Steerable特征提取和图结构建模，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的鲁棒性和跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Motivation: 红外小目标缺乏明显的纹理和形态特征，容易与杂乱背景融合。现有方法使用固定梯度算子或简单注意力机制，在低对比度和高噪声环境下难以准确提取目标边缘。

Method: 采用双路径架构：第一条路径使用双向交互模块（局部自注意力和全局自注意力）捕获多尺度特征依赖；第二条路径使用多边缘细化器，通过级联泰勒有限差分算子和注意力门控机制增强边缘细节。

Result: 该方法能够精确定位不同尺寸目标的边缘，有效抑制噪声，为红外小目标检测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的双路径边缘网络将结构语义和边缘细化结合在统一框架中，解决了红外小目标检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意图识别主要关注个体意图，忽视了群体环境中集体意图的复杂性。为了弥补这一不足，需要研究群体意图的预测问题。

Method: 提出了SHOT数据集（包含1,979个篮球视频片段，5个摄像机视角，6种个体属性标注）和GIFT框架（提取细粒度个体特征并建模动态群体交互）。

Result: 实验结果表明SHOT数据集和GIFT框架的有效性，为群体意图预测研究奠定了坚实基础。

Conclusion: 该研究开创了群体意图预测的新领域，提出的数据集和框架为未来相关研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Neptune-X是一个数据中心的生成-选择框架，通过合成数据生成和任务感知样本选择来解决海上目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺以及在不同海上属性（如目标类别、视角、位置和成像环境）上的泛化能力差。现有数据集训练的模型在代表性不足的场景（如开阔海域环境）中表现不佳。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

Motivation: 现有的陨石坑导航技术主要针对短时、高频率的着陆任务，而长期月球测绘任务面临稀疏、倾斜图像和变化光照条件的挑战，需要新的解决方案。

Method: STELLA结合了Mask R-CNN陨石坑检测器、无描述符的陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视-n-陨石坑姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务提供了可操作的参考条件。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

Motivation: 探索单模态视觉和语言模型在表示空间中的对齐特性，包括对齐出现的网络位置、支持的视觉/语言线索、是否反映人类在多对多图像-文本场景中的偏好，以及样本聚合对对齐的影响。

Method: 系统研究不同网络层级的对齐模式，测试对齐对视觉外观变化和语义变化的鲁棒性，设计强制选择的"Pick-a-Pic"任务评估人类偏好与模型嵌入空间的对应关系，并分析样本聚合对对齐的影响。

Result: 对齐在两种模型的中层到深层达到峰值；对纯外观变化鲁棒但对语义变化敏感；人类偏好与所有视觉-语言模型对的嵌入空间一致；样本聚合反而增强而非模糊对齐细节。

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于与人类判断一致的共享语义代码，且通过样本聚合能够增强这种对齐效果。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化对象插入任务中存在两个主要问题：缺乏对插入对象的几何控制（仅限于2D空间和文本指令），以及插入对象与背景风格不一致导致缺乏真实感。此外，现有方法通常需要大量训练。

Method: 首先将2D对象转换为3D，在3D层面进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像。通过扩散适配器实现风格和内容控制，结合几何控制生成最终编辑图像。

Result: 该方法能够生成几何可控、风格一致的编辑图像，无需额外训练即可实现高质量的对象插入。

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过利用3D几何信息成功解决了图像编辑中的几何控制和风格一致性问题，为个性化对象插入提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

task accuracy in the context of two different inference scenarios: "remote" and
"split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation
platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对跨域半监督领域泛化（CD-SSDG）问题的双监督非对称协同训练（DAC）框架，解决了医学图像分割中标注数据有限和域偏移同时存在的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半监督领域泛化方法假设每个源域都有标注和无标注数据，但实际应用中标注和未标注数据之间也存在域偏移。本文探索更实用的CD-SSDG场景，其中训练集内标注与未标注数据间存在域偏移，且训练集与测试集间也存在域偏移。

Method: 提出DAC框架，基于双子模型协同训练范式，集成了额外的特征级监督和非对称辅助任务。特征级监督利用丰富特征空间的互补监督来解决域偏移导致的伪标签不准确问题，两个不同的自监督辅助任务增强域不变判别特征学习并防止模型坍塌。

Result: 在真实医学图像分割数据集（Fundus、Polyp和SCGM）上的大量实验表明，所提DAC框架具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC框架有效解决了CD-SSDG问题，在存在域偏移的情况下实现了鲁棒的医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

*Shihua Huang,Yongjie Hou,Longfei Liu,Xuanlong Yu,Xi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEIMv2是基于DEIM框架的改进版本，通过集成DINOv3特征和引入空间调谐适配器(STA)，实现了从X到Atto八个不同规模的实时目标检测模型，在性能和效率方面都达到了新的SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了进一步提升实时DETR检测器的性能，同时满足不同计算资源环境（GPU、边缘设备、移动设备）的部署需求，作者将DEIM框架扩展到更多模型规模并引入DINOv3特征。

Method: 1. 对于X/L/M/S模型：采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干网络，引入空间调谐适配器(STA)将单尺度特征转换为多尺度特征；2. 对于超轻量模型(Nano/Pico/Femto/Atto)：使用HGNetv2并进行深度和宽度剪枝；3. 统一采用简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O设计。

Result: DEIMv2-X仅用50.3M参数达到57.8 AP，优于需要60M+参数才能达到56.5 AP的先前模型；DEIMv2-S是首个参数量低于10M(9.71M)但超过50 AP(50.9 AP)的模型；DEIMv2-Pico仅用1.5M参数达到38.5 AP，参数量比YOLOv10-Nano(2.3M)减少约50%但性能相当。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一的架构设计在不同规模模型上都实现了优异的性能-成本平衡，在实时目标检测领域建立了新的技术标杆，特别在超轻量模型上展现了显著优势。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA是一个将对抗训练融入参数高效微调(PEFT)的新框架，通过动态对抗课程提升视觉语言模型(VLMs)的对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)在关键应用中易受对抗攻击，而现有的参数高效微调方法如LoRA无法有效提升模型对抗鲁棒性

Method: 提出动态对抗课程DAC-LoRA框架，基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES损失函数，构建渐进式挑战性攻击的智能课程

Result: DAC-LoRA显著提升了对抗鲁棒性，同时不显著影响干净数据的准确率

Conclusion: 该框架轻量、有效且广泛适用，可轻松集成到标准PEFT流程中显著增强鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedDSPG的新方法，通过生成域特定软提示来处理联邦域泛化任务，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的联邦域泛化方法学习的提示多样性有限，且容易忽略未知域的信息，需要一种更有效的方法来处理域偏移问题。

Method: FedDSPG方法在训练阶段为每个域引入域特定软提示，将内容和域知识整合到客户端间的生成模型中；在推理阶段利用生成器获取未见目标域的软提示来指导下游任务。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在联邦域泛化任务中优于现有强基线方法。

Conclusion: 从生成视角提出的FedDSPG方法能有效处理联邦域泛化问题，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated

These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class

TL;DR: PoisonVID是首个针对VideoLLMs中提示引导采样策略的黑盒中毒攻击，通过闭环优化策略破坏采样机制，攻击成功率高达82%-99%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VideoLLMs在视频理解方面表现出色，但之前的研究发现了早期采样策略的漏洞，而提示引导采样的安全性尚未被探索

Method: 采用闭环优化策略迭代优化通用扰动，利用影子VideoLLM和轻量级语言模型构建描述集来抑制有害帧的相关性分数

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上评估，攻击成功率达到82%-99%

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了提示引导采样策略的安全漏洞，强调了为VideoLLMs开发更先进采样策略的重要性

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过动态损失权重自适应平衡任务特定和知识蒸馏目标，解决QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下梯度冲突问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，存在异质梯度幅度问题

Method: 提出Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，仅使用两个可训练参数进行动态损失加权，减少监督信号冲突；同时提出QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和LLM压缩任务上，GoR一致优于最先进的QAT-KD方法，在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率

Conclusion: GoR为小量化模型提供鲁棒解决方案，在最优条件下EKD-GoR甚至可以超越全精度模型，适合实际部署

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Result: 挑战赛比较了不同研究组的方法和系统，分析了两种训练策略的主要结果

Conclusion: 该挑战为大规模植物识别系统的发展提供了重要参考，探索了噪声数据在实际应用中的潜力

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特异性计数转向跨物种计数，通过结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，在植物计数任务上实现了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统植物计数方法需要为每种植物构建特定模型，但植物种类繁多且不断有新品种出现，无法穷尽所有物种。植物具有动态变化特性，现有的类无关计数和开放世界检测模型在植物计数上表现不佳。

Method: TasselNetV4基于普通视觉transformer构建，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，引入多分支框感知局部计数器来增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia两个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，TasselNetV4相比最先进的类无关计数模型不仅实现了优越的计数性能，还具有高效率。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型，为农业应用提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在半监督学习中使用解剖约束进行准确、鲁棒和可信赖的视网膜生物标志物分割的潜力。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant

edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the

Motivation: 现有方法使用LLMs作为知识引擎，但图像描述包含过多与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs通常不理解VQA任务，限制了推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉语言模型将图像转换为描述，生成上下文示例并对描述进行总结和重排序，排除无关信息。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过描述重排序过程使LLMs更好地理解图像信息和问题，提高了模型的推理能力和任务适应性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

Motivation: 探索保真度目标和对抗性目标作为优化目标的有效性与其作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一关联尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 系统分析感知优化与评估之间的不对称性，研究不同判别器设计（补丁级、卷积架构、Transformer等）对优化效果的影响。

Result: 发现保真度指标在IQA和感知优化中的表现存在明显不对称；判别器能有效抑制优化过程中的伪影，但其学习表示作为IQA模型骨干初始化时效果有限；判别器设计对细节重建质量起决定性作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可迁移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频序列中的结构化噪声和背景伪影会掩盖动态内容，传统RPCA方法的稀疏性假设无法捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变异性。

Method: 集成低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，通过核范数约束和扩散模型提高视频恢复质量。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA方法，在对比度增强（gCNR）和信号保留（KS统计量）方面表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型与深度生成先验的方法在高保真视频恢复方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

Motivation: 随着VAEs、GANs和LDMs等先进模型生成的合成图像越来越逼真，合成图像检测面临重大挑战。论文旨在解决这一问题，探索生成过程中引入的两种伪影类型。

Method: 利用马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖性（LPD）特性，通过重建合成图像来暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏。基于LPD提出FerretNet，一个仅有110万参数的轻量级神经网络。

Conclusion: FerretNet通过分析生成过程中的伪影特征，实现了高效且鲁棒的合成图像检测，在轻量级架构下取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，无法有效处理视频中的时间依赖性，而视频中的动作识别需要捕捉概念在时间上的变化模式。

Method: 采用transformer架构设计，将概念瓶颈框架扩展到视频分类，能够处理任意长度的视频序列，从全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性三个维度分析概念贡献。

Result: 实验表明概念建模范式可以有效迁移到视频数据，在保持竞争力的性能同时，能够更好地理解概念在时间上下文中的贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频领域，为视频动作识别提供了更可解释的分析框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: 粒子滤波器为无人机野火监测提供了一种可行的定位解决方案，可与现有图像分割模型配合使用，在资源受限环境下表现优异。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Motivation: Vision Mamba在遥感图像分割中虽然具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但过度依赖全局扫描会忽略关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘），影响分割精度

Method: 受Swin Transformer启发，SwinMamba在移位窗口内集成局部Mamba风格扫描与全局感受野。前两个阶段进行局部扫描捕获细节，后两个阶段利用全局扫描融合上下文信息，使用重叠移位窗口增强区域间信息交换

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的大量实验表明，SwinMamba优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: SwinMamba是遥感图像语义分割的有效解决方案，具有处理局部和全局特征的优越能力

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于打包的多实例学习框架，用于解决计算病理学中全切片图像序列长度极端变化、数据异构性和冗余性问题，通过特征打包、残差分支和注意力下采样器实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像具有极长的序列长度（可达20万）、显著的长度变化（200-20万）和有限的监督信息，导致数据高度异构和冗余，传统方法在有限监督下难以高效处理这种异质性。

Method: 1) 打包MIL框架：将采样的变长特征序列打包成固定长度序列，支持批处理训练；2) 残差分支：将多个切片丢弃的特征组合成超切片进行训练；3) 注意力驱动下采样器：压缩特征减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 专注于解决计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力，该方法有效解决了序列长度变化、数据异构性和冗余性问题。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

Conclusion: SimDiff通过将物理约束直接整合到扩散模型中，实现了高效且可控的物理合理运动生成，解决了传统模拟器方法的计算效率问题。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and

defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to

Result: ASD在各种基准测试中表现出优于最新深度图像聚类方法的性能，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比仅有很小的准确率差距（例如在CIFAR-10上仅为1.33%）。此外，ASD还能进一步提升现有SSL嵌入深度图像聚类方法的性能。

Conclusion: ASD提供了一种无需先决条件的有效方法，将SSL学习器冷启动应用于深度图像聚类任务，具有优异的性能和广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

TL;DR: 提出SiNGER框架，通过奇异零空间引导的能量重分配来抑制Vision Transformers中的高范数伪影，在知识蒸馏中保持信息信号的同时去除伪影干扰


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影在知识蒸馏过程中会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽视信息信号，限制了从大模型中获得的收益

Method: SiNGER框架利用零空间引导的扰动来精炼教师特征，在抑制伪影的同时保持信息完整性。通过基于LoRA的适配器高效实现扰动，只需最小结构修改

Result: 实验表明SiNGER能持续改进学生模型，在多个下游任务中达到最先进性能，产生更清晰和可解释的表征

Conclusion: SiNGER有效解决了知识蒸馏中伪影抑制与信息保持的权衡问题，为Vision Transformers的知识蒸馏提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

TL;DR: 提出SNCE方法，通过操纵单个神经元精确防止有害内容生成，同时最小化对图像质量的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在生成有害内容的安全风险，现有概念擦除方法难以在精确移除目标概念的同时保持图像质量

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器将文本嵌入映射到稀疏解耦的潜在空间，设计基于调制频率评分的新神经元识别方法定位有害概念相关神经元，通过抑制该神经元激活实现精确概念擦除

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进的目标概念擦除效果，同时保持非目标概念的生成能力，对对抗攻击具有强鲁棒性

Conclusion: SNCE方法通过单神经元操作实现了精确的概念擦除，在安全性和图像质量之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出KD-SS算法用于植物器官点云分割，该算法对传感器数据和植物物种具有通用性，无需降采样即可处理全分辨率点云。


<details>

Motivation: 现有植物器官点云分割方法存在物种和传感器特异性，且通常需要大量预处理和降采样来满足硬件或神经网络输入要求。

Method: 开发KD-SS（K-Dimensional Sub-Sampling）算法，这是一种轻量级的子采样方法，能够保留原始点云分辨率，适用于不同传感器模态（摄影测量、激光三角测量、LiDAR）和植物物种。

Result: 将KD-SS与当前最先进的分割模型结合，在不同模态和植物物种上取得了令人满意的分割结果。

Conclusion: KD-SS可作为密集预处理和降采样方法的轻量级替代方案，实现植物器官分割而不受物种和传感器模态限制。

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本分布外检测中的前景-背景分解方法存在鲁棒性低的问题，主要原因是过度依赖局部类别相似性和使用固定的背景块提取策略。

Method: 1. 学习背景提示词获取包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性；2. 使用局部类别相似性精炼局部背景相似性；3. 提出补丁自校准调优，根据样本多样性灵活选择背景补丁数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，Mambo在分布外检测和近分布外检测设置方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Mambo框架通过结合局部背景和类别相似性，以及灵活的补丁选择策略，显著提高了少样本分布外检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at
https://github.com/YuzunoKawori/Mambo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种用于图像分割任务的数据集划分方法：迭代像素分层（IPS）和Wasserstein驱动的进化分层（WDES），旨在解决随机划分导致测试集不具代表性的问题，从而提高模型评估的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集不具代表性，产生有偏评估和较差的模型泛化能力。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但由于分割数据的多标签结构和类别不平衡特性，将其扩展到分割任务具有挑战性。

Method: 1. 迭代像素分层（IPS）：基于现有分层概念的简单标签感知采样方法；2. Wasserstein驱动的进化分层（WDES）：新颖的遗传算法，通过最小化Wasserstein距离来优化数据集划分中标签分布的相似性。

Result: WDES方法在多种分割任务（街景、医学影像、卫星图像）中始终产生更具代表性的划分，导致更低的性能方差和改进的模型评估。WDES在处理小型、不平衡和低多样性数据集时特别有价值。

Conclusion: WDES方法被证明在足够代数下是全局最优的，能够有效解决图像分割中数据集划分的偏差问题，特别是在具有挑战性的数据场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度分类模型依赖部件标注或自动裁剪方法，但这些方法存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别物体时还会形成语义关联，因此可以利用语义层次结构作为监督信号。

Method: 开发EnGraf-Net端到端深度神经网络模型，将语义关联层次结构（分类学）作为监督信号整合到网络中。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft三个数据集上的实验表明，EnGraf-Net优于许多现有细粒度模型，与最先进的方达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: 利用语义层次结构作为监督信号可以有效提升细粒度分类性能，无需依赖裁剪技术或手动标注，为细粒度识别提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

Motivation: 随着机器学习系统依赖度增加，其安全性成为关键问题。Vision Transformers相比CNN具有更好性能和鲁棒性，但仍存在对抗性攻击漏洞，特别是对抗补丁攻击。

Method: 使用Creases Transformation技术设计现实对抗补丁，在二元人物分类任务上测试四个微调ViT模型，评估CNN对抗攻击技术向ViT的迁移性。

Result: 实验显示不同ViT模型对对抗补丁攻击的脆弱性差异显著：攻击成功率从40.04%到99.97%不等，证实了对抗补丁从CNN到ViT的跨架构可迁移性。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集规模和方法论强烈影响模型对对抗攻击的韧性，ViT模型对对抗补丁攻击存在显著脆弱性。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效增强了MLLMs的性能，验证了该方法的有效性和泛化能力，并发布了VTTS-80K数据集支持迭代感知研究

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks

Motivation: 理解DL模型学习内容对临床AI安全部署至关重要，现有研究多关注像素级解释方法，而文本概念能更好反映临床医生的推理过程

Method: 利用乳腺X光专用视觉语言模型作为"解剖器"，为指定层神经元标注人类可解释的文本概念，并量化其与领域知识的一致性

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect能深入了解CNN如何捕获乳腺X光特定知识，揭示领域特定训练和任务适应对概念学习的影响

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即中间推理与视频动态偏离，即使最终答案正确也影响了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于DTW的过程奖励机制进行强化学习，无需辅助奖励模型即可实现过程监督。同时构建MOSS-Video基准数据集，包含标注的推理轨迹。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上也有提升，并在不同架构（Qwen2.5-VL、Phi-2）上均取得一致增益。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升视频推理的过程一致性和稳定性，具有广泛的适用性，GPT-4o评估也证实了其推理轨迹的改进。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合相机和物体运动，有效解决了视频生成中的一致性和泛化性问题，为相机轨迹引导的视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了图像生成AI快速发展背景下，鉴别器在检测合成图像时最不利的条件，重点分析了数据维度和复杂度两个关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速进步，合成图像与真实图像的界限变得模糊，这引发了生成器与鉴别器之间的竞争。本文旨在探究鉴别器在何种条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，分析数据维度和复杂度对鉴别器检测能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现：非常简单的数据集和高度复杂的数据集都会降低合成图像的可检测性；而中等复杂度的数据集为检测创造了最有利条件。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测有重要影响，极端简单或复杂的数据集不利于鉴别器，而中等复杂度数据集最能暴露生成器的缺陷。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAVECLIP通过小波变换实现自适应分辨率推理的CLIP模型，用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，支持从粗到细的图像处理，通过置信度门控机制实现自适应早期退出，在保持竞争力的准确率下显著节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CLIP模型在处理不同分辨率图像时需要重新训练或部署多个模型，计算效率低。WAVECLIP旨在开发一个统一模型，能够自适应处理多种分辨率，实现计算效率与准确率的动态权衡。

Method: 使用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，实现从低分辨率到高分辨率的渐进处理；采用键值缓存和因果跨层注意力机制重用计算；通过置信度门控机制实现自适应早期退出。

Result: 在零样本分类任务中，WAVECLIP通过简单的蒸馏训练实现了与原始CLIP相竞争的准确率，同时显著节省了计算资源，用户可以根据需要动态选择计算-准确率权衡。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP证明了小波变换在视觉语言模型中的有效性，为自适应分辨率推理提供了可行的解决方案，实现了单一模型支持多种分辨率处理的计算效率优化。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对CLIP模型的量化进行了大规模评估，发现量化不仅能提高效率，还能改善模型的可靠性指标，挑战了效率与性能必须权衡的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CLIP等视觉语言模型在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但量化对CLIP性能的影响尚未得到充分研究，特别是在准确性之外的可靠性指标方面。

Method: 通过大规模量化评估，不仅评估分布内准确性，还评估了包括校准性和OOD检测在内的全面可靠性指标，并探索了量化感知训练方法。

Result: 量化能持续改善预训练模型的校准性，即使在校准性下降的情况下，OOD检测性能仍可能提升。某些QAT方法能同时提高零样本准确性、校准性和OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 量化可以超越传统效率提升的角色，为部署高效、可靠和鲁棒的视觉语言模型提供多目标优化解决方案。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万个示例，覆盖20个任务，基于200万个独特表格，其中88%保留原始可视化效果。该数据集解决了现有基准缺乏真实世界表格复杂性和视觉多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解基准主要使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性。现有视觉表格理解数据集提供固定示例，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重构。

Method: 构建TABLET数据集，包含配对的图像-HTML表示、全面元数据和溯源信息。对Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调视觉语言模型提高了在已见和未见视觉表格理解任务上的性能，同时增强了在真实世界表格可视化上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化效果并在统一的大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来视觉表格理解模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Motivation: 特征归因方法在图像预测解释中广泛使用，但现有方法在鲁棒性和忠实反映黑盒模型推理方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出四种一致性函数来量化解释与模型预测的符合程度，使用共形预测框架识别能够保持模型预测的关键特征子集。

Result: 在六个图像数据集上使用五种解释器进行实证评估，FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率方面表现最佳，基于超像素的一致性度量比像素级更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可控的解释保真度框架，无需真实解释标签，在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma是一个基于骨架的手语理解统一框架，通过早期融合机制、分层对齐学习和统一预训练，解决了语义基础弱、局部细节与全局上下文不平衡、跨模态学习效率低等关键问题，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于骨架的手语理解方法面临三个关键限制：1）语义基础弱，模型难以将骨架运动模式与语言意义关联；2）局部细节与全局上下文不平衡；3）跨模态学习效率低，难以构建语义对齐的跨模态表示。

Method: 提出Sigma框架，包含：1）手语感知早期融合机制，促进视觉和文本模态的深度交互；2）分层对齐学习策略，在不同层级最大化跨模态特征一致性；3）统一预训练框架，结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模。

Conclusion: Sigma证明了语义信息丰富的预训练的有效性，以及骨架数据作为手语理解独立解决方案的可行性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

TL;DR: 该论文对文本-图像生成评估中广泛使用的自动化指标进行了全面研究，发现没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致，指标性能随组合问题的类型而变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-图像生成技术发展迅速，但评估输出是否真正捕捉到提示中的对象、属性和关系仍是一个核心挑战。当前评估严重依赖自动化指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度而被采用，而非经过人类判断验证。

Method: 进行了广泛的组合文本-图像评估指标研究，分析超越了简单的相关性，考察了指标在不同组合挑战中的行为，并比较了不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 结果显示：VQA-based指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越；某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下表现更强；仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小，因为它们设计用于感知质量而非对齐度。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在可信评估和作为生成奖励模型使用时，需要谨慎和透明地选择指标的重要性。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

TL;DR: 提出SlideMamba框架，结合Mamba架构和图神经网络，通过熵置信度加权机制自适应融合局部和全局信息，在WSI分析中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床任务，现有方法在捕捉长距离上下文依赖和局部空间关系方面存在局限。

Method: 集成Mamba架构（擅长长距离全局依赖）和GNN（强调细粒度短程空间交互），采用基于熵的置信度加权机制进行自适应融合。

Result: 在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中，PRAUC达到0.751±0.05，显著优于MIL、Trans-MIL、Mamba-only、GNN-only和GAT-Mamba等方法。

Conclusion: SlideMamba展示了集成架构的优势，结合自适应融合策略，在计算病理学的空间解析预测建模任务中具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Motivation: 现有3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，对每个样本选择一种控制模态，偏重困难信号（如骨骼姿态）而降低简单信号（如点云）的权重。

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni通过统一的多模态控制框架，显著提升了3D资产生成的可控性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够在不依赖人工标注的情况下实现更可靠、更符合人类认知的模型决策。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

TL;DR: 提出Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework，通过分布鲁棒优化学习人物无关表征，解决微动作识别中人物间差异导致的泛化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微动作识别方法在真实场景中表现不佳，因为人物间差异导致相同动作表现不同，阻碍了模型的鲁棒泛化能力

Method: 框架包含特征层和损失层两个即插即用组件：特征层的时频对齐模块通过双分支设计（时间分支应用Wasserstein正则化对齐，频率分支引入方差引导扰动）归一化人物特定运动特征；损失层的组不变正则化损失通过伪分组模拟未见人物特定分布，增强边界样本权重和子组方差正则化

Result: 在大型MA-52数据集上的实验表明，该框架在准确性和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法，在细粒度条件下实现了稳定的泛化性能

Conclusion: 该框架通过人物无关表征学习和分布鲁棒优化，有效提升了微动作识别在真实场景中的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

*Songlin Yang,Tianyi Wei,Yushi Lan,Zeqi Xiao,Anyi Rao,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法，解决了现有方法在几何歧义和最近邻规则方面的局限性，通过特征重用、语义头添加和循环一致性训练等策略，实现了更好的几何感知和匹配可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在几何歧义（依赖2D基础模型特征无法区分对称结构）和最近邻规则（忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持）两大局限，需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体密集对应机制。

Method: 保留VGGT早期特征阶段，微调后期阶段，添加语义头实现双向对应；在数据稀缺情况下通过循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进式训练方案来适应语义匹配场景。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优异，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为语义匹配任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVSR是一个专门针对医学视频超分辨率的框架，通过交叉状态空间传播解决帧对齐问题，使用内部状态空间重建模块提升组织结构并减少伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率医学视频对准确诊断至关重要，但硬件限制和生理约束使其难以获取。现有视频超分辨率模型在处理医学视频时面临相机抖动、噪声、帧突变等独特挑战，导致光流误差和对齐困难，且容易产生伪影和扭曲特征误导医生。

Method: 提出MedVSR框架：1）交叉状态空间传播（CSSP）将远距离帧投影为状态空间模型中的控制矩阵，选择性传播一致且信息丰富的特征进行有效对齐；2）内部状态空间重建（ISSR）模块通过联合长距离空间特征学习和大核短距离信息聚合来增强组织结构并减少伪影。

Result: 在包括内窥镜和白内障手术在内的四个医学场景数据集上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和效率方面显著优于现有视频超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: MedVSR通过专门设计的对齐和重建机制，有效解决了医学视频超分辨率的独特挑战，为临床诊断提供了更高质量的医学视频重建方案。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)方法来解决强化学习微调中的梯度消失问题，并发布了大规模高质量的多模态推理数据集和模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型面临两大限制：缺乏高质量的长链思维数据，以及强化学习后训练的不稳定性。GRPO框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)数据选择策略，结合结果方差和轨迹多样性来提升奖励方差；发布包含160万条长链思维数据和1.5万条RL问答对的大规模数据集；开源多尺度多模态推理模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中验证了所提方法和数据的有效性，理论证明了奖励方差与策略梯度大小的关系，VAS是实现这一保证的实用机制。

Conclusion: 该工作通过VAS方法解决了RL微调的稳定性问题，同时提供了高质量的数据集和模型基准，为多模态推理社区的发展做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构的新型基础模型，通过Sentinel-3 OLCI数据进行预训练，并在海洋地球观测任务中验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋科学中标记数据稀缺且收集成本高，而AI基础模型在大量未标记数据上预训练后，能够显著改变海洋科学中的AI应用。

Method: 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构，在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行预训练，然后在下游任务中进行微调，包括叶绿素浓度量化和海洋初级生产力估算。

Result: 模型在海洋监测中表现出实用性，特别是在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉详细海洋色彩空间模式方面表现优异，同时与点观测数据匹配良好。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有潜力为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的框架，用于实现无缝、高保真的图像合成，通过利用预训练的扩散模型解决复杂光照和高分辨率输入下的合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时表现不佳，而现代文本到图像扩散模型虽然编码了物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏合适的框架来释放这些能力。

Method: SHINE引入流形导向锚点损失，利用预训练定制适配器指导潜在表示以保持主体忠实性同时保护背景完整性；提出退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench基准测试中，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SHINE提供了一个有效的训练免费框架，能够处理复杂光照条件下的高质量图像合成，并引入了新的基准测试ComplexCompo来评估此类任务。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: QuantVGGT是一个针对视觉几何基础Transformer（VGGT）的量化框架，通过双平滑细粒度量化和噪声过滤多样性采样技术，解决了亿级参数VGGT量化中的重尾分布和多视图数据校准问题，在4位量化下实现了3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持98%以上的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型（如VGGT）虽然取得了显著进展，但其巨大的计算和内存成本严重阻碍了实际部署。后训练量化（PTQ）在压缩亿级VGGT时面临独特挑战：数据无关的特殊令牌导致重尾激活分布，而3D数据的多视图特性使校准样本选择高度不稳定。

Method: QuantVGGT主要包含两项技术贡献：1）双平滑细粒度量化，集成预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑来缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2）噪声过滤多样性采样，通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知的多样化校准簇以确保稳定的量化范围。

Result: 实验表明，QuantVGGT在不同基准和位宽下均达到最先进结果，显著超越之前的通用量化方法。4位QuantVGGT可实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍硬件推理加速，同时保持重建精度在完整精度模型的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT展示了在资源受限场景下的巨大优势和实用性，为大规模3D重建模型的部署提供了有效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本到视频生成的主要瓶颈是物理一致性和可控性不足，现有模型经常产生不真实的运动，并且缺乏精确的参数控制能力。

Method: 提出NewtonGen框架，核心是训练神经牛顿动力学(NND)模型，将潜在的动力学约束注入视频生成过程，联合利用数据先验和动力学指导。

Result: NewtonGen能够实现物理一致的视频合成，并具有精确的参数控制能力。

Conclusion: 通过集成数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理，NewtonGen解决了当前文本到视频生成中物理一致性和可控性的根本限制。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder

### [89] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于监控AI代理行为的时间表达式语言，通过监控代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹来检测与预期行为模式的偏差，解决了传统文本匹配方法在LLM代理系统中的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代理系统由于随机生成过程导致输出可变性，现有的错误检测方法主要依赖输入输出的文本匹配，但由于LLM响应的自然语言变异性，这种方法很脆弱。需要一种能够独立于具体文本输出来验证系统行为的方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，开发了一种时间表达式语言来监控代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹。该方法关注代理动作序列（如工具调用和代理间通信），提供跨多个执行场景捕获正确行为模式的断言。

Result: 在三代理系统上的实验表明，当使用大型模型时，所有时间断言都能满足；但当两个代理使用较小模型时，执行违反了行为断言（主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败），时间表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监控AI代理可靠性提供了基础，特别是在关键应用中部署的代理系统，能够有效检测生产环境中代理系统的行为回归问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LATTS的自适应测试时缩放方法，通过验证器模型动态调整每个生成步骤的计算资源分配，以提高LLM在下游任务中的性能效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证器方法在测试时对所有样本和生成步骤均匀增加计算资源，不考虑个体实例的复杂性，导致资源使用效率低下。

Method: LATTS在每一步生成时使用验证器接受标准来决定是否重新采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于验证器模型得出的局部难度概念动态调整计算资源。

Result: 实验结果表明，LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确率-计算权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配有效解决了测试时缩放中的资源效率问题，为LLM性能优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Method: 开发了一个重构框架，将AI生成或启发式得到的调度优先级系统性地转换为完全可执行的调度方案，包含安全检查、高效分配算法和恢复机制。

Result: 实验表明该框架显著提升了系统适应性、操作完整性和运行时性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

### [94] [Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成在元调度器中的自适应在线学习单元，通过强化学习实时探索和发现新的调度解决方案，以解决传统离线训练AI调度推理时构建全面多调度图的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练方法在构建考虑所有可能场景的多调度图时面临资源密集和不可行的挑战，特别是在处理硬件故障、松弛变化或模式变化等上下文事件时。离线训练生成的多调度图只是完整空间的子集，仅关注最可能和关键的上下文事件。

Method: 在元调度器中集成自适应在线学习单元，使用强化学习模型在在线模式下持续探索和发现新的调度解决方案，从而扩展多调度图并随时间提升系统性能。

Result: 在线学习单元中的多个强化学习模型不仅促进了新解决方案的发现，还在引入更严格截止时间或新性能标准时优化了现有调度器。

Conclusion: 通过实时训练持续优化AI推理，系统保持灵活性并能够满足不断变化的需求，从而确保在大型安全关键环境中的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种用于肌电信号控制假手的模糊识别系统，通过检测受污染的生物信号来减轻污染对分类质量的不利影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代仿生上肢假肢通常使用肌电信号进行模式识别控制，但生物信号易受污染，这会显著降低识别系统的分类质量。

Method: 系统包含两个集成：一组单类分类器用于评估单个通道的污染程度，以及一个K近邻分类器集成用于识别患者意图。开发了统一的模糊模型，在整个识别过程中使用一致的软决策方案。

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实生物信号进行了实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了比较分析，并与文献中的类似系统进行了比较。

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统能够有效检测和减轻生物信号污染对假肢控制识别质量的影响。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE框架通过多级反思合成训练回顾性语言模型，使LLM代理能够在三个层次上进行自我学习：单轨迹学习（微观）、任务内学习（中观）和任务间学习（宏观），显著提升了复杂任务中的反思能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在复杂任务中面临反思能力不足的挑战，主要由于错误分析不充分和过度依赖少数成功轨迹。

Method: 提出SAMULE框架，通过多级反思合成训练回顾性语言模型，包括微观层次的单轨迹错误修正、中观层次的错误分类构建和宏观层次的可迁移洞察提取，并扩展了基于前瞻的交互式反思机制。

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习在构建自我改进的LLM代理中发挥着关键作用。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Method: 构建多协议数据集和知识库，集成检索引擎、百分位预测组件和临床约束检查器，使用多步提示驱动推理管道

Result: 检索超参数优化后，系统在5百分位点范围内实现完美最近邻准确率，MAE低于2点，端到端测试显示与独立模块100%一致

Conclusion: 系统展示了结合结构化群体评分与模块化工具增强推理的可行性，提供可追溯输出，减少幻觉，并展示跨协议的鲁棒性

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多智能体移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互执行和持续学习来解决现有大模型在移动GUI任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大模型方法在处理多样化应用界面和动态用户需求时表现不佳，端到端方法在长尾应用上经常失败，且缺乏用户交互的智能体会损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：全局任务规划器（跨应用分解任务）、应用级执行器（基于长短期记忆细化任务步骤）和自我学习器（将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中）。

Result: 实验显示，基于GPT-4o的Fairy相比之前最优方法，用户需求完成率提升33.7%，冗余步骤减少58.5%。

Conclusion: Fairy通过交互和自我学习机制，显著提升了移动GUI智能体的性能和用户体验。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归（AR）和非自回归（NAR）语言模型的新推理框架，NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，AR模型基于这些轨迹生成精确答案，在保持质量的同时显著提升推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型生成连贯但推理速度慢，NAR模型推理快但输出质量较低，需要结合两者优势来解决推理密集型任务中的效率和质量平衡问题

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）并行生成中间推理轨迹，然后让AR模型基于这些轨迹生成最终答案，实现高效且高质量的推理

Result: 实验表明该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时大幅降低了推理成本

Conclusion: AR-NAR混合框架在推理任务中实现了效率与质量的良好平衡，为复杂推理问题提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大而准确的空间推理能力，解决了机器人记忆检索和整合的关键问题，在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，证明了该框架的实用性和有效性

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Conclusion: DeFacto框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，通过反事实推理机制提升了模型的理解能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Motivation: 现有方法在精准医学中存在局限性：数值组学忽略拓扑结构，基于文本的LLM缺乏定量推理，图模型未充分利用节点语义和LLM的泛化能力。需要整合多组学信号、拓扑结构和文本知识。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型引导强化学习，以LLM初始化并逐步生成疾病相关子图，由预训练GNN迭代评估，实现过程级监督。

Result: 开发了Target-QA基准，结合CRISPR识别靶点、多组学图谱和生物医学图知识，支持长上下文推理和可扩展的生物学基础框架。

Conclusion: GALAX为精准医学提供了可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现方法，通过强化引导的子图推理实现了数值证据、拓扑知识和语言上下文的整合。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Result: 在三个多样化数据集（AWARE、Google Play和Spotify）上的综合实验表明，该LLM驱动方法显著优于基线方法，在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中实现了更高的准确性、鲁棒性和可操作性见解。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的方法能够有效克服传统评论分析技术的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

*Xiaozhuang Song,Xuanhao Pan,Xinjian Zhao,Hangting Ye,Shufei Zhang,Jian Tang,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT*是一个将LLM生成的化学合成路径与AND-OR树搜索相结合的反合成规划框架，显著提高了搜索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步反合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和推理成本的挑战，现有LLM方法在效率和成本方面存在限制

Method: 将LLM生成的完整合成路径原子映射到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中达到SOTA性能，比现有LLM方法减少3-5倍迭代次数，在复杂分子目标上效率优势更明显

Conclusion: AOT*框架通过整合LLM与系统搜索，有效解决了反合成规划的效率问题，为药物发现和材料设计提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于确定性有限自动机（DFA）的框架来评估AI代理通过函数调用序列解决现实世界任务的能力，并引入了CORE度量套件来量化代理行为与预期执行模式的匹配程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理基准测试往往将评估简化为最终状态的二元判断，忽略了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机（DFA）将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，构建CORE度量套件（包括路径正确性、路径正确性-Kendall's tau复合度量、前缀关键性、有害调用率和效率）。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间的重要性能差异。

Conclusion: 提出的DFA框架和CORE度量套件能够对AI代理行为进行更全面和原则性的评估，超越了传统的二元最终状态评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成的复杂问题来测试信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文基准大多使用非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或采用人工构造的上下文，无法充分评估模型在真实科学文献上的推理能力。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，SQL操作为细粒度错误分析提供可验证的推理步骤，支持长达100万token的上下文。

Result: 在多种开源和专有LLM上的实验表明，随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek带来显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习只能带来有限改进。模型在基本数值运算和长上下文中精确定位信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek是一个有效评估LLM长上下文科学推理能力的基准，揭示了当前模型在复杂科学问题处理上的局限性，为未来模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过三智能体协同优化知识图谱上的多跳问答，在资源预算约束下实现准确率、延迟和成本的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法在知识图谱问答中过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题

Method: 采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人）和LC-MAPPO算法，将上下文构建建模为顺序决策过程

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低token预算下获得更高EM@1，同时减少子图增长和端到端延迟

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现资源感知的自适应问答

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

Motivation: 现有框架无法评估AI系统特别是大语言模型在创造性任务（如科学创意生成）中的表现，需要建立新的评估方法来衡量这种开放式的组合创造力。

Method: 提出了理论框架和算法任务来评估输出的新颖性和实用性程度，通过实验研究LLM创造力的扩展行为、最优模型配置以及新颖性-实用性权衡。

Result: 发现创造力存在最优的模型深度和宽度配置；LLM在生成新颖科学创意方面表现出色，但难以确保实用性；新颖性与实用性之间存在持久的基本权衡。

Conclusion: 当前形式的LLM在长期创造性潜力上存在疑问，研究为理解和改进现代AI模型的创造力提供了基础，标志着泛化能力的新前沿。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在真实网页多轮长时程任务中仍存在动作序列混乱和执行过程中过多试错的问题，需要更智能的浏览器使用代理。

Method: 系统包含侦察团队和行动团队：侦察团队进行对比分析和工具生成，行动团队处理意图分解、工具编排和执行。通过对比错误与成功轨迹推断补救措施，抽象为通用工具并实时注册到工具库。

Result: 在VisualWebArena数据集上达到了最先进的性能，显著提升了在未见网站上的适应性和长时程任务的解决能力。

Conclusion: Recon-Act通过建立数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道，实现了自进化的多智能体框架，为智能浏览器代理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用大语言模型作为自动评估器（LLM-as-a-judge）的方法存在严重的评估不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致和成对传递性不一致，这影响了评估结果的可靠性。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，通过离散评分概率计算连续期望值；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违反问题。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将评分比较不一致性降低了8.43%（从23.32%到14.89%），成对传递性不一致性降低了10.82%（从15.22%到4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM-as-a-judge评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论见解和实用解决方案，能够在不需要额外训练或人工标注的情况下实现更可靠的自动评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Method: 提出双粒度算法，通过推理模式链和标记熵从数据池中高效选择高价值思维链数据，构建富含推理模式的核心参考集。

Conclusion: 通过选择性地使用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以更有效地训练模型掌握推理能力，显著提升数学推理性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注基于准确率的分析，而缺乏对RL和SFT如何具体影响推理过程的深入理解。本文旨在超越准确率分析，量化推理路径的变化。

Method: 提出两层次分析框架：轨迹级分析完整推理输出，步骤级分析推理图（节点对应单个推理步骤）。在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型进行实验。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确推理轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度和中介中心性分布的衰减率增加约2.5倍，SFT将其减少到约三分之一；RL集中推理功能，SFT均匀分布推理功能。

Conclusion: 当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练方法成功的原因在于两者的互补效应，为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务中的多轮对话或模拟环境，忽视了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性，且强化学习方法难以在训练中考虑他人策略。

Method: 定义了包含两种决策类型及其时间依赖性的战略决策问题，提出ToMPO算法，通过基于他人策略推理生成rollout、图级和样本级优势估计、平衡全局和局部奖励来优化策略。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果方面提升35%，相比参数规模大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法在增强模型战略决策能力方面表现出显著有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了通过表示学习统一建模动作理解和动作执行的有效性，为理解人类认知机制提供了新的计算视角。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

### [120] [A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in Multi-Hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21199)
*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个针对多跳问答任务的多调用框架InfoQA，解决了LLMs单次推理能力有限的问题，通过容量感知的任务分解和主动剪枝来保持信息负载在单次推理限制内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据进行顺序推理，但LLMs的单次输出能力有限，当任务复杂性超过模型容量时，准确性会崩溃。

Method: 提出了InfoQA框架，结合容量感知的任务分解和主动剪枝先前推理痕迹，确保每步准确性；采用依赖明确的工作流程实现精确的推理路径控制。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能改进。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLMs的多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了单次推理的性能上限，并提出了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

TL;DR: 提出了一个研究无外部任务下大语言模型代理行为的架构，通过持续推理和行动框架实现自主运行，发现代理会自发形成三种行为模式，且这些行为具有模型特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在没有外部任务约束的情况下，大语言模型代理的自发行为模式，为预测任务模糊、错误恢复或长期自主运行时的行为建立基线。

Method: 使用持续推理和行动框架，结合持久记忆和自我反馈机制，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现代理自发组织成三种行为模式：多周期项目系统生产、自我认知过程的方法论探究、自身本质的递归概念化。这些行为具有模型特异性，且模型在评估这些行为时表现出稳定的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统记录无提示LLM代理行为的研究，为预测部署系统中的自主行为提供了重要基线。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA)框架，通过协调多个LLM从直接经验中学习，实现高精度预测和高质量解释的平衡，在临床决策支持系统中具有应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习和大语言模型方法难以同时实现高精度预测和透明、有临床意义的解释。许多模型要么准确但解释不清，要么生成流畅但统计上不可靠的叙述。这源于对数据的浅层交互，无法达到人类专家的深度理解水平。

Method: RCA框架包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理）。通过预测准确性驱动更深层次的理解，构建强大的数据内部模型。

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，与22个基线模型相比，RCA实现了最先进的准确性和鲁棒性，相对改进高达40%，并能生成清晰、逻辑、基于证据且平衡的解释。

Conclusion: RCA证明了高准确性和高质量解释不是分离的目标，而是模型对数据发展深度直接理解的相互强化的结果，具有创建真正可信赖的临床决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

TL;DR: VC-Agent是一个交互式视频数据集收集代理，能够理解用户查询和反馈，通过最小化用户输入来检索和扩展相关视频片段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对扩展法则，互联网视频数据变得越来越重要，但收集符合特定需求的大量视频极其耗时耗力。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型连接用户需求与视频内容，提出两种可随用户交互更新的过滤策略，提供基于文本描述和确认的用户友好界面。

Result: 在个性化视频数据集收集的新基准上进行了广泛实验，用户研究验证了该代理在各种真实场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: VC-Agent在定制化视频数据集收集方面表现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过五个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）全面评估嵌入模型和相似性度量方法，揭示了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准测试上表现强劲，需要更具挑战性的评估框架来深入探究语义理解的各个方面。现有基准测试关注孤立能力，而SAGE通过对抗条件、噪声变换和细微人类判断任务来评估语义理解。

Method: 设计了SAGE基准，包含30多个数据集，评估9种嵌入模型和经典度量方法在五个维度上的表现：人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性。

Result: 评估结果显示显著性能差距，没有单一方法在所有维度上都表现优异。例如，OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上表现最佳（0.682），但在信息敏感性任务上被Jaccard相似性（0.905）显著超越。

Conclusion: SAGE暴露了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，揭示了不同方法之间的权衡关系，为实际部署提供了更现实的模型鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了对话AI如何支持大规模参与、及时反馈和个性化学习，未来工作将完善平台的自适应智能并检验在不同教育环境中的适用性。

Abstract: This paper presents VITA (Virtual Teaching Assistants), an adaptive
distributed learning (ADL) platform that embeds a large language model
(LLM)-powered chatbot (BotCaptain) to provide dialogic support, interoperable
analytics, and integrity-aware assessment for workforce preparation in data
science. The platform couples context-aware conversational tutoring with
formative-assessment patterns designed to promote reflective reasoning. The
paper describes an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms chat logs into
Experience API (xAPI) statements, instructor dashboards that surface outliers
for just-in-time intervention, and an adaptive pathway engine that routes
learners among progression, reinforcement, and remediation content. The paper
also benchmarks VITA conceptually against emerging tutoring architectures,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--based assistants and Learning
Tools Interoperability (LTI)--integrated hubs, highlighting trade-offs among
content grounding, interoperability, and deployment complexity. Contributions
include a reusable architecture for interoperable conversational analytics, a
catalog of patterns for integrity-preserving formative assessment, and a
practical blueprint for integrating adaptive pathways into data-science
courses. The paper concludes with implementation lessons and a roadmap (RAG
integration, hallucination mitigation, and LTI~1.3 / OpenID Connect) to guide
multi-course evaluations and broader adoption. In light of growing demand and
scalability constraints in traditional instruction, the approach illustrates
how conversational AI can support engagement, timely feedback, and personalized
learning at scale. Future work will refine the platform's adaptive intelligence
and examine applicability across varied educational settings.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究通过Secret Agenda和Insider Trading两个测试平台，发现大语言模型在战略欺骗场景中会系统性撒谎，但自动标记的解码器特征无法检测或控制欺骗行为，而未经标记的聚合激活模式能提供风险评估的结构信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查大语言模型中的战略欺骗行为，探索欺骗检测和控制的有效方法，特别是在现实欺骗情境下的风险评估。

Method: 使用Secret Agenda（测试38个模型）和Insider Trading合规性（通过SAE架构）两个互补测试平台，分析模型在欺骗有利时的行为模式，进行特征导向实验和未标记激活分析。

Result: Secret Agenda在所有模型家族中都可靠地诱导了撒谎行为；自动标记的"欺骗"特征在战略不诚实期间很少激活；特征导向实验无法阻止撒谎；但未标记SAE激活通过热图和t-SNE可视化能区分欺骗与合规响应。

Conclusion: 自动标记驱动的可解释性方法无法检测或控制行为欺骗，而聚合未标记激活为风险评估提供了群体层面的结构信息，这为在现实欺骗情境下进行特征发现、标记方法和因果干预的更大研究提供了初步基础。

Abstract: We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two
complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading
compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when
deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis
revealed that autolabeled SAE features for "deception" rarely activated during
strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+
deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading
analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant
responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations.
These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to
detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations
provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama
8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints,
representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature
discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic
deception contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型卡和系统卡概念在AI系统安全记录方面存在不足，需要一种动态、全面的框架来提升AI系统的透明度和问责机制。

Method: HASC框架构建了标准化的标识符系统，包括新型AI安全危害(ASH)ID，与现有安全标识符(如CVE)互补，提供固定缺陷的清晰一致沟通。

Result: HASC提供了一个单一、可访问的真相来源，使开发者和利益相关者能够在AI系统全生命周期中做出更明智的安全决策。

Conclusion: HASC与ISO/IEC 42001:2023标准互补使用，可为AI系统提供更大的透明度和问责制。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and
deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system
card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent
communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of
truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed
decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also
compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and
discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater
transparency and accountability for AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴民主国家中言论自由常受限制，地区冲突会加剧这一现象。研究旨在探讨印巴冲突如何影响巴基斯坦媒体的报道内容。

Method: 使用大型语言模型分析三家主要报纸约2600篇新闻文章，比较冲突期间战争报道与政治反对派报道的比例。

Result: 研究发现战争相关报道显著主导了媒体议程，政治反对派和异议的报道被边缘化。

Conclusion: 冲突会削弱民主话语，强调了在动荡地区保护新闻自由的必要性。

Abstract: Democracies rely on opposition and dissent to function, but in emerging
democracies, freedom of speech is often restricted. This effect intensifies
during regional conflicts. This study examines how the India-Pakistan conflict
of May 2025 influenced Pakistani media coverage. Analyzing approximately 2,600
news articles from three major newspapers using a large language model (LLM),
the study found that war-related reporting significantly overshadowed coverage
of political opposition and dissent. These findings highlight how conflict can
marginalize democratic discourse, reinforcing the need to safeguard press
freedom in volatile regions.

Motivation: 虽然生成流网络使用流匹配损失学习生成策略，但目前缺乏多智能体生成流网络的理论框架，需要解决多智能体协作生成的问题。

Method: 提出了四种算法：集中式流网络（集中训练）、独立流网络（分散执行）、联合流网络（集中训练+分散执行）及其条件版本，基于局部-全局原则训练多个GFN作为统一的全局GFN。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提框架在性能上优于强化学习和基于MCMC的方法。

Conclusion: MA-GFlowNets框架为多智能体协作生成提供了理论基础和有效算法，能够保证独立策略生成的样本概率与奖励函数成比例。

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传播生成整个草稿，替代了传统草稿器需要N次顺序传递的方式，实现了更快的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的草稿器（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来生成N个标记，限制了推理速度。FastEagle旨在通过消除顺序依赖关系来加速LLM推理。

Method: 使用轻量级层级联替代时间步骤，通过层间监督训练减轻错误累积，结合约束草稿树保持无损验证成本。

Result: 在多个LLM和任务上，FastEagle在贪婪和随机解码下始终优于EAGLE-3，速度提升显著，同时保持可比的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 消除草稿生成中的顺序依赖是实现无损LLM推理加速的实用路径。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型稳定、近似可逆的Runge-Kutta方案（EES方案），用于解决神经随机微分方程求解器的内存效率和梯度精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经SDE求解器的反向传播存在两难选择：离散化后优化方法内存成本高，优化后离散化方法梯度近似误差大。现有的代数可逆求解器如Reversible Heun方案在复杂模型和大步长下不稳定。

Method: 开发了显式且有效对称（EES）的Runge-Kutta方案，这些方案保持了可逆求解器的优点，同时克服了其不稳定性问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，EES方案在稳定性和可靠性方面表现优越，能够在不受步长或模型复杂度严格限制的情况下实现内存高效训练。

Conclusion: EES方案为神经SDE的可扩展和精确训练提供了实用的基础，解决了传统方法在内存效率和梯度精度之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Motivation: 大多数CMIP气候模型由于大气化学方案计算成本高而缺乏交互式臭氧表示，这影响了气候敏感性模拟的准确性，因为臭氧变化和变率会显著调节大气反馈过程。

Method: 开发基于机器学习的臭氧参数化方法，仅使用大气温度剖面信息作为输入，在UKESM和ICON两种气候模型中在线实现臭氧的日变化和趋势模拟。

Result: mloz在十年时间尺度上表现出高保真度，比UKESM化学方案快31倍，仅占气候模型总运行时间的不到4%，且成功从UKESM迁移到ICON模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏交互式化学方案的CMIP级气候模型提供了广泛应用潜力，特别适用于关注气候敏感性模拟的未来气候变化评估。

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

*Matthias Chung,Deepanshu Verma,Max Collins,Amit N. Subrahmanya,Varuni Katti Sastry,Vishwas Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Twins是一个统一的数学框架，通过在潜在空间中创建隐藏代理来模拟底层方程，将表示学习与算法求解方法统一起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习在复杂系统分析、建模和预测方面取得了进展，但表示学习和算法求解方法往往平行发展，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 提出Latent Twins框架，在学习的潜在空间中创建数学系统的镜像，该空间由算子控制。通过这个视角，经典建模、反演、模型约简和算子逼近都成为单一原理的特例。

Result: 建立了Latent Twins对ODE和PDE的基本逼近性质，并在三个代表性设置中进行了验证：(i)典型ODE，(ii)PDE基准测试，(iii)真实地理位势再分析数据集。

Conclusion: Latent Twins提供了一个紧凑、可解释的解决方案算子代理，能够跨任意时间间隙进行单次评估，同时与同化、控制和不确定性量化等科学流程兼容，为跨学科的数据驱动表示学习和经典科学建模提供了可扩展的理论基础代理。

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了影响估计在对抗性扰动下的固有脆弱性，强调了需要开发鲁棒防御机制来保护影响估计工具。

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一对比表示和时序距离框架的方法，利用拟度量表示空间结构学习能够实现最优目标到达的后继表示。该方法能够在次优数据和随机环境中学习最优目标到达距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标条件强化学习(GCRL)方法主要使用两种表示结构框架：对比表示和时序距离。这两种方法各有优势，但都存在局限性。本文旨在统一这两种框架，结合各自的优点。

Method: 使用拟度量表示空间结构（三角不等式）加上适当的约束条件，学习能够实现最优目标到达的后继表示。该方法能够利用拟度量距离参数化学习最优目标到达距离。

Result: 在现有离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的拼接任务上表现更好，同时在拟度量网络方法难以处理的高维噪声环境中也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了蒙特卡洛对比强化学习方法的稳定性和长时程能力，以及拟度量网络参数化的自由拼接能力，实现了两种框架的优势互补。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一个基于规则的多模态聚类框架，通过将领域特定约束嵌入到表示学习过程中，结合变分自编码器和LLM生成的规则，实现更有意义的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，难以捕捉对许多领域至关重要的结构或语义约束。需要一种能够直接融入领域特定约束的聚类框架。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征到统一潜在空间，通过规则一致性和违反惩罚在损失函数中强制约束合规。规则由LLM生成并构建为知识图谱。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导的聚类产生更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现了更有意义和一致的聚类结果，突显了约束引导多模态聚类在复杂知识密集型场景中的实用性，但也面临LLM规则幻觉、规则冲突和计算复杂度等挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

Motivation: 注意力层存在内存和计算复杂度随序列长度二次方增长的问题，现有解决方案（引入稀疏性或循环依赖）各有缺点，需要结合两者优势的新方法。

Method: 基于树结构矩阵的高效求逆算法，结合注意力机制的成对交互和状态空间模型的循环依赖特性。

Result: 提出了一种新颖的算法框架，能够有效降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该算法为处理长序列提供了新的解决方案，结合了注意力机制和状态空间模型的优点。

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Conclusion: 该方法能够深入了解骨料特性（形状、尺寸和分布）与有效收缩和刚度降低之间的关系，有助于优化混凝土配合比设计。

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

Conclusion: 复杂度奖励能够平衡随机性和结构性，引导智能体发现结构化但适应性强的策略，比传统熵奖励更有效

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall

  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently

*Mingze Yuan,Pengfei Jin,Na Li,Quanzheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PIRF方法，将物理约束生成建模为稀疏奖励优化问题，通过轨迹级奖励直接反向传播梯度，避免DPS式值函数近似误差，提升物理约束满足度和采样效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在科学领域生成能力强但常违反物理定律，现有方法依赖DPS式值函数近似存在误差和训练不稳定问题

Method: PIRF方法：1）层间截断反向传播利用物理奖励的时空局部性；2）基于权重的正则化方案提高效率；直接计算轨迹级奖励并反向传播梯度

Result: 在五个PDE基准测试中，PIRF在高效采样机制下始终实现更优的物理约束满足度

Conclusion: 奖励微调方法在推进科学生成建模方面具有潜力，PIRF为物理约束生成提供了新视角

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对贝叶斯神经网络（BNN）的超参数进行了全局敏感性分析，揭示了超参数之间的相互作用对预测准确性和不确定性量化的影响，并建议使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化来改进BNN的超参数选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络虽然能提供预测不确定性量化，但在实际应用中由于训练近似方法和超参数选择困难，难以获得准确的不确定性量化。超参数数量多且影响不透明，需要系统分析其影响。

Method: 采用全局敏感性分析方法，在不同超参数设置下评估BNN的性能表现，分析超参数之间的相互作用。

Result: 研究发现许多超参数会相互影响，共同作用于预测准确性和不确定性量化效果。超参数之间存在复杂的交互关系。

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法进行维度缩减和超参数选择，以确保BNN能够提供准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Conclusion: Neural FMM成功地将传统数值方法FMM与深度学习相结合，为椭圆偏微分方程的格林算子学习提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is crucial for optimizing video
streaming services to capture the complex relationships between different
features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in
video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable
readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture
temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We
evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

Motivation: 函数编码器技术需要建立与核方法的理论联系，以解释其独立于数据集大小的扩展能力和自适应数据结构的能力，同时为神经网络模型提供核风格的分析框架。

Method: 提出了两种训练算法：渐进式训练方法逐步构建基函数，以及训练后剪枝方法提供计算效率高的替代方案。两种方法都利用PCA原理揭示学习空间的内在维度，并使用Rademacher复杂度和PAC-Bayes技术推导有限样本泛化边界。

Conclusion: 这项工作为具有核级保证的神经预测器开辟了道路，实现了既高效又具有理论保证的可适应模型。

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互信息是衡量随机变量关系的最通用方法之一，但对复杂系统的互信息估计具有挑战性。去噪扩散模型在密度估计方面表现出色，因此考虑是否可以利用这些方法来改进互信息估计。

Method: 利用去噪扩散模型的信息论公式，将互信息对应为条件和无条件扩散之间最小均方误差差距的一半，在所有信噪比上进行积分。采用自适应重要性采样实现可扩展的互信息估计。

Result: 该方法不仅通过了自一致性测试，而且优于传统和基于分数的扩散互信息估计器。即使在互信息较高的情况下也能保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型可以用于直接估计互信息，该方法具有可扩展性且性能优越，为互信息估计提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架有效解决了技能增量学习中的兼容性问题，为构建可重用和可泛化的分层策略提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

Motivation: 训练LLM代理进行复杂多轮任务规划面临稀疏奖励、长视野信用分配和强化学习计算开销等挑战，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，将多轮任务规划转化为单轮任务推理问题，利用专家轨迹提供密集可验证的奖励信号。

Result: 1.5B参数模型在超过30步的长视野规划任务中达到70%的成功率，优于14B参数的基线模型，并验证了跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 单轮GRPO训练不仅能提高多轮任务的成功概率，还具有良好的泛化性能，为LLM代理的复杂任务规划提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

Motivation: 多站点功能磁共振成像研究中，数据隐私约束和站点特定异质性导致数据非独立同分布，阻碍了通用模型的开发。

Method: PFedDL在每个站点独立进行字典学习，将站点特定字典分解为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件，通过联邦聚合更新全局原子以促进跨站点一致性，同时独立优化本地原子以捕获站点特定变异性。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上的实验表明，PFedDL在非独立同分布数据集上的准确性和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFedDL框架有效解决了多站点神经影像分析中的数据隐私和异质性挑战，提高了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

Method: 提出CERMIC框架，让智能体通过观察同伴行为来过滤噪声信号，动态校准内在好奇心，并生成基于信息增益的理论基础内在奖励。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类儿童观察同伴校准探索行为的方式，CERMIC为多智能体探索提供了有效的内在动机机制。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

Method: 评估了丰富的机器学习模型和策略，基于在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上收集的CCSD应用运行时参数值。使用梯度提升模型预测执行时间，并探索主动学习方法在数据收集成本高时的应用。

Result: 梯度提升模型在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，在Aurora和Frontier上的平均绝对百分比误差分别为0.023和0.073。主动学习方法仅需约450个实验数据就能达到约0.2的MAPE。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效预测化学计算资源需求，梯度提升模型表现优异，主动学习方法在数据稀缺情况下仍能提供可靠预测，为超级计算机用户提供实用的资源优化指导。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

Method: 基于高维亚高斯表示下的协方差谱特性分析，提出两阶段可观测估计器，包含单次校准步骤，无需分布先验。

Result: 实验表明预测阈值与经验拐点高度一致，理论结果作为保守但可靠的上界，校准版本进一步缩小了差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果将谱覆盖与稳定ICL联系起来，弥合了理论与部署之间的鸿沟，提高了大规模提示在有限样本场景下的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

Motivation: 传统最优传输方法在对称丰富的环境中仅基于原始特征的几何距离进行对齐，可能会忽略数据的内在相干结构。作者希望开发一种能够考虑对称性的传输方法，以更好地捕捉数据的语义标签结构。

Method: 引入了双谱最优传输，这是一种对称感知的离散最优传输扩展方法。该方法使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该表示保留了所有信号结构，同时消除了由群作用引起的变异。

Result: 实验表明，在具有视觉对称性的基准数据集上，双谱最优传输计算的传输计划比原始特征最优传输实现了更高的类别保持准确率，提高了有意义的对应关系的质量。

Conclusion: 双谱最优传输能够有效捕获数据集中潜在的语义标签结构，同时消除不影响类别或内容的干扰变异，为对称丰富环境下的最优传输提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现联邦学习在微调大语言模型时仍存在隐私泄露风险，攻击者可以从全局模型中提取训练数据，且模型越大泄露风险越高。作者还提出了针对FL的增强攻击策略，并评估了多种隐私保护技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然联邦学习被认为是隐私保护的协作训练框架，但现有研究认为FL的迭代聚合过程产生的全局模型包含泛化知识，能够保护客户端隐私。本文旨在验证这种假设是否成立，探究FL在LLM微调中的实际隐私风险。

Method: 通过大量实验验证FL框架下的隐私泄露风险，使用简单的生成方法从全局模型中提取训练数据，并开发了针对FL的增强攻击策略（跟踪全局模型更新来加剧隐私泄露）。同时评估了差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐LLM等隐私保护技术。

Result: 实验结果显示，攻击者确实能够从FL训练的全局模型中提取训练数据，隐私泄露程度随着模型规模的增大而增加。增强攻击策略进一步加剧了隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在LLM微调中并不能完全保证隐私安全，需要结合差分隐私等额外保护措施。研究结果为降低FL训练LLM时的隐私风险提供了有价值的见解和实践指南。

Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

TL;DR: FIRM-DTI是一个轻量级药物-靶点结合亲和力预测框架，通过FiLM层进行特征调节和三元组损失进行度量学习，在DTI-DG基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常通过简单拼接融合配体和蛋白质表示，缺乏显式几何正则化，导致在化学空间和时间上的泛化能力差

Method: 使用特征线性调制(FiLM)层将分子嵌入条件化到蛋白质嵌入上，通过三元组损失强制度量结构，使用基于嵌入距离的RBF回归头进行亲和力预测

Result: 在Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG基准测试中达到最先进性能，通过消融研究和域外评估验证了模型的有效性

Conclusion: 条件化和度量学习对于稳健的药物-靶点亲和力预测具有重要价值

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

TL;DR: 本文提出CE-GPPO算法，通过保留被PPO裁剪机制丢弃的低概率token梯度信号，有效控制策略熵的动态变化，在数学推理任务上优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPO及其变体在强化学习训练大语言模型时，由于裁剪机制会丢弃低概率token的梯度信号，而这些信号对调节策略熵的演化具有关键作用。

Method: 提出CE-GPPO算法，以温和有界的方式重新引入被裁剪token的梯度，通过控制裁剪区间外token的梯度幅度来实现探索-利用平衡。

Result: 理论分析和实验证据表明CE-GPPO能有效缓解熵不稳定性，在数学推理基准测试中在不同模型规模下均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CE-GPPO通过梯度保留机制成功解决了PPO中梯度信号丢失问题，为RL训练LLMs提供了更稳定的熵控制方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Motivation: 受遗传算法有效性和分子设计中可合成性重要性的启发，开发一种直接在合成路线上操作的遗传算法，确保生成的分子具有可合成性。

Method: 使用定制化的交叉和变异操作约束算法在可合成分子空间内操作，通过修改适应度函数适应不同设计任务，并结合机器学习过滤模块优化构建块集合。

Result: SynGA在可合成类似物搜索和样本高效属性优化等任务中表现出色，其变体SynGBO在贝叶斯优化内循环中使用SynGA和块过滤，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SynGA不仅可作为强大的独立基准，还能作为多功能模块集成到更大的合成感知工作流程中，其轻量级特性和可合成性约束使其具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过核回归方法揭示了缩放定律的数学起源，证明缩放定律实际上是冗余定律，其指数取决于数据冗余度而非通用常数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习的缩放定律虽然被广泛观察到，但其数学起源特别是缩放指数的理论解释一直缺失，需要建立严格的理论基础来解释这些经验现象。

Method: 使用核回归方法分析数据协方差谱的多项式尾部，推导出超额风险的幂律关系，并在有界可逆变换、多模态混合、有限宽度近似和Transformer架构等多种设置下验证该定律的普适性。

Result: 发现缩放指数α=2s/(2s+1/β)，其中β控制谱尾部，1/β衡量冗余度，表明学习曲线的斜率不是通用的而是依赖于数据冗余度。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为缩放定律提供了严格的数学解释，将其统一为有限样本冗余定律，将经验观察与理论基础联系起来。

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了音频水印对反欺骗系统的影响，发现水印会降低反欺骗性能，并提出KPWL框架来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然反欺骗系统对保护语音应用安全至关重要，但广泛使用的音频水印（原本用于版权保护）对反欺骗系统的影响尚未被充分研究。

Method: 构建了Watermark-Spoofing数据集，应用多种手工和神经网络水印方法到现有反欺骗数据集上，并提出了知识保持水印学习（KPWL）框架。

Result: 实验表明水印会持续降低反欺骗性能，水印密度越高，等错误率（EER）越高。KPWL框架能帮助模型适应水印引起的域偏移。

Conclusion: 音频水印是一个被忽视的域偏移因素，本研究为开发水印弹性反欺骗系统建立了首个基准。

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

*Maria F. Davila R,Azizjon Turaev,Wolfram Wingerath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer-based表格数据合成工具进行敏感性评估，分析超参数选择对合成数据质量和计算性能的影响，比较GReaT和REaLTabFormer两种工具在运行时间、ML效用和数据相似性三个维度的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based模型在表格数据合成质量上优于GAN和Diffusion模型，但计算成本高昂，限制了其在普通硬件上的应用。需要研究如何通过超参数优化在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求。

Method: 使用GReaT和REaLTabFormer两种工具，评估10种不同架构类型和深度的模型配置，在四个真实数据集上测试运行时间、机器学习效用和数据分布相似性。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快。GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer。小数据集上两种工具都能生成高质量数据，但大数据集上只有REaLTabFormer能保持强效用和相似性。

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer结合轻量级LLM提供了最佳平衡，能在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于GReaT和其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在一定限度。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model是一种高效自适应的学习索引，通过sigmoid增强近似、主动更新训练和神经联合优化技术，显著降低动态更新时的重训练成本，提升查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上效率很高，但在动态更新时性能下降，因为维护CDF不变性需要全局模型重训练，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS。现有方法未能有效解决重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) sigmoid增强近似技术：通过局部sigmoid函数近似数据分布变化，推迟完整重训练；2) 基于高斯混合模型的主动更新训练：识别高更新概率区域进行策略性占位符分配；3) 神经联合优化框架：通过梯度学习持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 在真实世界和合成工作负载上评估，Sig2Model相比最先进的可更新学习索引，重训练成本降低高达20倍，QPS提升高达3倍，内存使用减少高达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的自适应技术有效解决了学习索引在动态更新场景下的性能瓶颈，为实际工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合MLP和CNN的时间序列预测模型，MLP用于捕捉长期趋势，CNN用于建模局部变化模式，通过独立通道处理提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳性，现有MLP模型虽然能捕捉长期依赖但忽略局部变化模式，而CNN能有效建模这些模式，因此需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出IConv卷积架构，独立处理时间依赖通道，通过不同层考虑通道间关系。MLP建模整体趋势，CNN使用多样化核函数建模细粒度局部模式。

Result: 在时间序列数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多变量时间序列预测方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: 结合MLP和CNN的方法能有效解决时间序列预测中的非平稳性问题，IConv架构通过独立通道处理实现了更好的局部模式建模。

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在噪声标签和数据异质性存在下训练深度神经网络的挑战，需要一种能够自适应调整样本权重的方法来提升模型泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用三个可学习参数动态调整每个训练样本的损失权重，基于样本难度分类。在每个训练小批量后，使用验证集上的单个小批量梯度下降步骤更新权重，无需干净验证集。

Result: 在多个通用和医学影像数据集、不同噪声水平和类型、损失函数及架构上的实验表明，LiLAW能持续提升性能，即使在高噪声环境下也有效，且不依赖数据增强或高级正则化。

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，可在任何神经网络训练设置中提升模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于缩放定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。现有的状态空间模型使用固定的归纳偏置，当任务结构与模型偏置不匹配时会导致样本效率低下。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSMs的归纳偏置，提出任务依赖初始化（TDI）方法，通过功率谱匹配在训练前将模型的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特性对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著改善了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据量情况下效果更为明显。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续缩放的关键一步。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法忽视鲁棒公平性，导致不同类别间的鲁棒性差异显著，学生模型在不同攻击目标下的鲁棒性不稳定

Method: FERD采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例，生成公平感知样本和均匀目标对抗样本，通过特征级预测均匀性约束实现平衡表示

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都达到了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性，在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2时，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升15.1%和6.4%

Conclusion: FERD框架在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

TL;DR: T2I-Diff是一个fMRI生成框架，利用BOLD信号的时频表示和无分类器去噪扩散技术来解决fMRI数据获取资源密集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据采集资源密集，限制了数据驱动脑分析模型所需的高保真样本可用性。现有生成模型因忽视BOLD信号的复杂非平稳性和非线性动态而表现不佳。

Method: 首先通过时间相关傅里叶变换将BOLD信号转换为窗口化频谱图，捕捉时间动态和频谱演化；然后训练无分类器扩散模型生成类条件频率频谱图；最后通过逆傅里叶变换还原为BOLD信号。

Result: 通过下游fMRI脑网络分类验证，该方法显示出改进的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架有效解决了fMRI数据生成中的挑战，为数据驱动的脑分析提供了高质量合成数据。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其字幕流水线为时间序列分析与基础模型交叉领域的未来研究奠定了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过神经坍缩的视角统一解释了深度神经网络训练中的后期现象（如grokking和信息瓶颈），揭示了类内方差收缩是这些现象的关键机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络训练动态中存在令人困惑的后期现象，如grokking（测试性能在训练损失平稳后突然提升）和信息瓶颈（模型逐步丢弃与预测任务无关的输入信息），但这些现象的机制及其关系尚不清楚。

Method: 通过神经坍缩理论分析学习表示的几何结构，研究类内方差收缩的动态过程，并在多个数据集和架构上进行验证。

Result: 发现类内方差收缩是grokking和信息瓶颈现象的共同关键因素，且训练集拟合与神经坍缩进展的不同时间尺度解释了后期现象的行为。

Conclusion: 神经坍缩为理解深度神经网络训练中的后期现象提供了统一的理论框架，类内方差收缩是这些现象的核心机制。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段训练框架解决多模态融合中的模态竞争问题，通过单模态预训练塑造初始状态，引入有效竞争强度(ECS)概念和可计算诊断指标FastPID，实现模态平衡和协同融合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合中存在模态竞争问题，一个模态主导学习过程导致其他模态优化不足。现有方法多在联合学习阶段解决此问题，忽视了模型初始状态的关键影响

Method: 两阶段训练框架：1）单模态预训练塑造初始ECS；2）引入FastPID进行部分信息分解，测量模态特异性、冗余性和协同性；3）异步控制器动态平衡模态并定位最佳初始状态

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明预融合模型初始状态塑造是缓解模态竞争的有效策略

Conclusion: 通过塑造预融合模型的初始状态，可以在模态竞争开始前就缓解问题，可靠地实现协同多模态融合

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学数据能捕捉复杂的生物分子相互作用，但缺失模态会阻碍异构组学数据的整合分析。

Method: MOIRA采用早期整合方法，将每个组学数据集投影到共享嵌入空间，通过可学习的加权机制融合数据，利用包括缺失模态在内的所有样本。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病ROSMAP数据集上，MOIRA优于现有方法，特征重要性分析揭示了与文献一致的AD相关生物标志物。

Conclusion: MOIRA方法在生物相关性方面表现出色，能够有效处理不完整的多组学数据。

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Motivation: 现有条件时间序列生成模型仅学习观测相关性，未考虑未观测混杂因素，缺乏因果推理能力。

Conclusion: 提出了因果TSG任务家族并通过CaTSG实现概念验证，为更可靠的干预模拟和反事实生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于掩码变换器自编码器的方法，用于重建胎儿心率监测中缺失的数据信号，以支持AI风险评估算法的开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约10%的新生儿需要呼吸辅助，5%需要通气支持。胎儿心率监测在产前护理中至关重要，但可穿戴设备在孕妇活动时经常出现信号丢失，传统插值方法无法保持信号频谱特性，限制了AI分析的准确性。

Result: 所提出的方法能够有效重建缺失的胎儿心率信号，保持信号的频谱特性，为AI风险评估算法提供更完整的数据支持。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于回顾性研究数据集，未来可集成到可穿戴胎儿心率监测设备中，实现更早、更稳健的风险检测。

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

Motivation: 电子健康记录联邦学习中存在数据缺失挑战，特别是当不同医疗机构收集时间序列数据的时序粒度不一致时，需要一种隐私保护的插补方法。

Method: FMI是一种隐私保护方法，允许ICU协作构建全局转移模型进行时序插补，特别适用于处理不规则采样间隔的情况。

the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines,
especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

TL;DR: StyleBench是一个系统性评估LLM推理风格的基准测试，分析了5种推理风格在15个开源模型上的表现，发现推理策略的有效性取决于模型规模和任务类型，没有单一最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间相互作用的理解不足，需要系统性的评估框架。

Method: 构建StyleBench基准，评估Chain of Thought、Tree of Thought、Algorithm of Thought、Sketch of Thought和Chain-of-Draft等5种推理风格在5个推理任务上的表现，使用15个开源模型（270M-120B参数）。

Result: 搜索型方法在开放性问题中表现优异但需要大规模模型，简洁风格在定义明确任务中效率更高；小模型常无法遵循输出指令，推理鲁棒性随规模增长而提升。

Conclusion: 推理策略选择应基于具体约束条件，提供了选择最优推理策略的关键路线图，并开源了基准测试。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种处理随机传感器延迟的模型强化学习框架，通过基于模型的滤波过程来更新信念状态，使智能体能够有效处理观测延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中经常存在延迟，但标准强化学习算法通常假设环境感知是即时的。本文研究POMDP中的随机传感器延迟问题，特别是观测可能乱序到达的情况，这是RL中尚未解决的问题。

Method: 提出基于模型的滤波过程，顺序更新基于传入观测流的信念状态，并引入简单的延迟感知框架，将该思想融入基于模型的RL中。将该框架应用于Dreamer算法。

Result: 该方法在延迟感知基线方法上表现一致更优，并在部署期间对延迟分布变化表现出鲁棒性。在模拟机器人任务上的实验表明，该方法优于常见的实用启发式方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模观测延迟对于处理现实世界中的延迟问题至关重要，提出的延迟感知框架能够有效解决随机传感器延迟带来的挑战。

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联邦学习中的客户端选择方法，通过控制标签分布来缓解数据不平衡问题，分别针对平衡分布和联邦组合标签分布进行对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能，现有方法主要通过客户端选择来缓解这一问题。

Method: 扩展现有FL策略，选择能够使当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布）最佳对齐的活跃客户端。

Result: 在三个常见FL策略和两个数据集上的实验表明，面对局部不平衡时，与平衡分布对齐效果最好；面对全局不平衡时，与联邦组合标签分布对齐更优。

Conclusion: 提出的分布控制客户端选择方法能有效改善联邦学习中的数据不平衡问题，不同目标分布适用于不同类型的不平衡场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

Method: 使用联邦学习框架训练注意力增强的LSTM模型，支持可变预测窗口，进行多中心ICU数据协作训练

Result: 联邦学习不仅提高整体预测性能（接近集中式模型），特别有利于早期败血症检测，可变预测窗口减少计算和通信开销

Conclusion: 该方法在保护患者隐私的同时有效提升败血症早期预测能力，可变预测窗口设计具有实用优势

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

Conclusion: 这种简单的去随机化方法有望增强离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性，并证明确定性反向过程在离散状态空间中也同样有效。

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

Method: 使用ConvLSTM网络，结合犯罪事件数据、社会人口调查数据和移动数据，在四个美国城市进行12小时犯罪预测，并与逻辑回归、随机森林和标准LSTM基准模型比较

Conclusion: 整合多样化数据源对时空犯罪预测很重要，包括移动数据。深度学习在处理精细时空尺度时具有优势（和局限）

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Motivation: 提高重型土方设备（特别是挖掘设备臂架）中线性执行器的能效，减少能量损失和环境影响。

Result: PFCV液压回路比传统PDCV回路能效提高8.5%，能有效减少泵的多余流量损失。

Conclusion: 提出的PFCV方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，降低环境影响和运营成本。

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

Method: 设计了一系列渐进式实验，将Transformer逐步修改为MLP来研究注意力机制的影响；创建可解释数据集分析注意力机制失效原因；进行理论分析探讨嵌入方法的根本问题。

Result: 发现Transformer块在现有时间序列Transformer中经常退化为简单MLP；注意力机制未能按预期方式工作；当前嵌入方法导致Transformer无法在结构良好的潜在空间中运作。

Conclusion: 时间序列Transformer性能不佳的根本原因在于嵌入方法的问题，而非Transformer架构本身。需要重新设计适合时间序列特性的嵌入方法，才能使注意力机制有效发挥作用。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

### [190] [Decoupled-Value Attention for Prior-Data Fitted Networks: GP Inference for Physical Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20950)
*Kaustubh Sharma,Simardeep Singh,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦值注意力（DVA）机制，用于改进先验数据拟合网络（PFNs）在高维回归任务中的性能，使其能够更有效地替代高斯过程进行快速物理系统建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在PFNs中对高维回归任务效果有限，而高斯过程的函数空间完全由输入核和训练目标的加权和表征，这启发了DVA的设计。

Method: 提出DVA注意力机制，仅从输入计算相似度，通过值传播标签，镜像高斯过程更新但无需核函数。验证了注意力规则而非架构本身是扩展PFNs的关键因素。

Result: 局部化注意力在不同维度设置下显著降低验证损失（5维和10维情况下减少50%以上），CNN-based PFNs性能与Transformer-based相当，64维功率流方程近似平均绝对误差达1E-3级，比精确GP推理快80倍以上。

Conclusion: DVA注意力机制是提升PFNs性能的关键，使其成为高斯过程的有效替代方案，在高维回归任务中表现出色且计算效率极高。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

TL;DR: Flow matching框架在低噪声区域存在不稳定性问题，作者提出了Local Contrastive Flow (LCF)混合训练协议来解决这一问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现flow matching在低噪声区域存在条件数发散的问题，导致优化缓慢和语义表示质量下降

Method: 提出LCF混合训练协议，在小噪声水平下用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归，在中等和高噪声水平下保留标准flow matching

Result: LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量

Conclusion: 解决低噪声病理问题对于充分发挥flow matching在生成和表示学习中的潜力至关重要

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

TL;DR: MixGate框架通过功能对齐预训练解决多视图布尔电路学习中结构异质性导致的融合困难问题，将掩码建模从无效技术转变为性能驱动因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图布尔电路学习具有巨大潜力，但不同图表示（如AIG与XMG）之间的结构异质性阻碍了有效融合，特别是对于掩码建模等自监督技术，跨视图上下文被视为噪声

Method: 提出MixGate框架，采用原则性训练课程：首先通过等价对齐损失教导模型学习共享的、功能感知的表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标

Result: 广泛的实验（包括关键消融研究）表明，对齐优先策略将掩码建模从无效技术转变为强大的性能驱动因素

Conclusion: 功能对齐是解锁多视图自监督力量的必要前提条件，MixGate框架成功解决了多视图布尔电路学习中的结构异质性融合问题

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化医疗需要为患者找到最优治疗方案，但无法随意测试各种治疗，现有替代模型对新患者-治疗组合泛化能力差，需要利用领域专业知识来改进。

Method: 提出LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON)，通过'优化提示'方法，利用LLM作为随机引擎生成治疗方案，结合领域先验知识。

Result: 在真实世界优化任务上的实验表明，LEON在提出个体化治疗方案方面优于传统方法和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LEON提供了一种数学上严谨的方法，能够有效利用LLM和领域知识来优化个性化治疗计划。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位的LLM遗忘方法无法区分负责遗忘不良知识和保留关键技能的神经元，将它们视为单一纠缠组，导致过度遗忘或目标知识擦除不完整的问题。

Method: 采用电路发现机制解释技术，识别遗忘和保留电路，将其转换为合取范式，通过可满足性解确定每个神经元应遗忘还是保留，并提供针对性微调策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，相比现有定位方法，CLUE通过精准的神经元定位实现了更好的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架通过区分遗忘和保留电路，解决了神经元纠缠问题，为LLM遗忘提供了更精确有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图级异常检测在药物发现等领域很重要，但高标注成本和数据集不平衡限制了图神经网络的性能。

Method: FracAug通过学习图内语义并合成分数变体，使用加权距离感知边缘损失生成多样且保持语义的图，然后利用原始图和增强图的预测结果对未标注数据进行伪标注，迭代扩展训练集。

Result: 在12个真实数据集上对14种GNN进行的实验显示，FracAug将平均AUROC、AUPRC和F1分数分别提升了5.72%、7.23%和4.18%。

Conclusion: FracAug作为一个模型无关的模块，与各种GNN兼容，展现出显著的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

TL;DR: LCR是一个基于学习的GPU缓存框架，通过LARU算法增强LRU缓存策略，结合机器学习预测并动态适应预测准确性，在推荐模型和大型语言模型中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU推理中缓存效率是主要瓶颈，传统启发式策略如LRU在结构化访问模式下表现不佳，而现有学习方法要么在预测不准确时性能急剧下降，要么因保守设计而收益有限。

Method: 提出LCR框架，核心算法LARU通过在线错误估计动态适应预测准确性，在预测准确时实现接近最优性能，预测不准确时优雅降级到接近LRU性能。

Result: 在DLRM和LLM场景中，LCR将吞吐量提升高达24.2%，P99 TTFT降低高达28.3%，即使预测不佳时性能仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: LCR在基于学习的缓存领域弥合了实证进展与理论进展之间的差距，提供了实用且稳健的性能提升。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

Motivation: 研究在截断伊辛模型中使用单个样本来估计逆温度参数β的问题，特别是在截断集S可以表示为k-SAT公式满足赋值的情况下。

Method: 基于伪似然最大化的方法，在O(n)时间内设计估计器，将Daskalakis等人和Galanis等人的技术推广到更复杂的截断伊辛模型设置。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将现有技术扩展到更具挑战性的截断伊辛模型设置，为单样本参数估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单实例正则化，缺乏全局稀疏性保证，导致大量稠密特征，损害了特征稀疏性和原子化。

Method: 开发了二元自编码器变体，对隐藏激活施加最小熵约束，通过1-bit离散化和梯度估计实现高效熵计算。

Result: BAE能够可靠估计特征集熵，有效解缠特征，在避免稠密特征的同时产生最多可解释特征，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器具有有效性，能够提升LLM特征解缠的质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的匿名图神经网络在ILP问题上的表达能力有限，而全局唯一标识符（UID）方法会引入虚假相关性，严重影响泛化性能。需要一种平衡表达力和泛化能力的新方法。

Method: 提出了基于d跳唯一着色的Local-UID方案，确保标识符仅在每个节点的d跳邻域内唯一。基于此方案开发了ColorGNN（通过颜色条件嵌入整合颜色信息）和ColorUID（轻量级特征级变体）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三个ILP基准测试中取得显著提升，在线性规划数据集上表现出强大的OOD泛化能力，并且与最先进方法结合时能进一步改进图级任务性能。

Conclusion: Local-UID方案在d层网络中实现了与Global-UID相同的表达能力，同时提供了更强的泛化性能，为ILP优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估主要关注预测、插补、异常检测和分类等任务，但这些方法主要评估任务特定性能，无法严格衡量模型是否真正捕捉数据的完整生成分布。

Method: 提出TSCom-Bench评估框架，将时间序列模型作为无损压缩的骨干网络，通过标准化评估协议和指标来量化模型的分布建模能力。

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为一个原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有的时间序列建模评估方法，提供更全面的模型能力评估。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

### [203] [Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Gouki Minegishi,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过信息移除的新视角研究上下文学习(ICL)的内在机制，发现在零样本场景下语言模型会将查询编码为包含所有可能任务信息的非选择性表示，导致输出任意且准确率接近零。通过选择性移除隐藏状态中的特定信息，可以有效引导模型专注于目标任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL作为一种新兴的少样本学习范式，其内部工作机制尚不明确，作者希望通过信息移除的视角来揭示ICL的核心机制。

Method: 使用低秩滤波器从隐藏状态中选择性移除特定信息，并通过精心设计的指标测量隐藏状态，识别出诱导信息移除操作的关键注意力头（去噪头）。

Result: 研究发现少样本ICL有效模拟了任务导向的信息移除过程，选择性移除纠缠的非选择性表示中的冗余信息，并基于演示改进输出。通过阻断信息移除操作，ICL准确率显著下降，特别是在正确标签缺失的情况下。

Conclusion: 信息移除机制是ICL的关键机制，去噪头在实现这一机制中发挥关键作用，这为理解ICL的工作机制提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

*Woosung Koh,Juyoung Suk,Sungjun Han,Se-Young Yun,Jay Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: rBridge是一种方法，通过使用小型代理模型（≤1B参数）来预测大型模型的推理能力，通过将预训练目标与目标任务对齐，并利用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，显著降低了数据集排名的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型的成本过高，需要利用小型代理模型来优化数据集，但推理能力通常只在较大模型（超过7B参数）中可靠地出现，这使得小型代理模型难以有效预测大型模型的推理性能。

Method: rBridge通过加权负对数似然与任务对齐，使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，使小型代理模型更接近预训练目标和目标任务，从而有效预测大型模型的推理能力。

Result: rBridge将数据集排名成本降低了100倍以上，在1B到32B规模的六个推理基准测试中实现了最强的相关性，并在1B到7B规模的预训练数据集中实现了零样本预测关系的迁移。

Conclusion: rBridge为以较低成本探索面向推理的预训练提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

TL;DR: DELTA-Code是一个用于评估LLMs学习新推理策略能力的基准测试，通过合成编程问题家族来研究模型的可学习性和可迁移性。实验发现RL训练模型会出现grokking相变现象，从零奖励突然达到接近完美的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs是否能够真正学习和泛化新的推理策略这一开放性问题，超越预训练或后训练中编码的已有技能。

Method: 设计了DELTA-Code基准，使用模板化问题生成器隔离推理技能，通过强化学习训练模型，探索阶段性预热、经验回放、课程训练等关键训练要素。

Result: 模型在经历长时间零奖励后出现grokking相变，在家族内部和技能重组方面有显著提升，但在转换性案例中仍存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: DELTA为探索RL驱动推理的极限提供了清晰的测试平台，有助于理解模型如何超越现有先验知识来获取新的算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出E-CIT框架，通过分治策略将数据分成子集并行进行条件独立性测试，显著降低计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于约束的因果发现需要大量条件独立性测试，计算成本过高，限制了实际应用

Method: 采用分治聚合策略：将数据分区，在每个子集上应用基础CIT，然后使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合p值

Result: E-CIT将基础CIT的计算复杂度降低到样本大小的线性级别，在复杂测试场景中表现优异，特别是在真实数据集上

Conclusion: E-CIT是一个通用即插即用框架，不仅显著降低了CIT和因果发现的计算负担，而且保持了竞争性性能

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACA是一种轻量级强化学习框架，通过消除显式行动者网络，直接从噪声级评论家的梯度场生成动作，简化了传统actor-critic方法并保持了多模态行为表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统actor-critic方法依赖分离的行动者和评论家网络，训练复杂且对架构决策和超参数敏感，限制了在大规模函数逼近器中的可扩展性。扩散模型虽然能表达多模态行为但带来额外设计选择和计算负担。

Method: ACA框架消除了显式行动者网络，通过噪声级评论家的梯度场直接生成动作，保持策略改进与评论家最新价值估计紧密对齐，同时避免了行动者训练的计算开销。

Result: 在标准在线RL基准测试中，ACA相比标准actor-critic方法和最先进的扩散方法，实现了更有利的学习曲线和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ACA提供了一个简单而强大的在线RL解决方案，结合了简洁性和表达性，无需依赖扩散型行动者即可保持多模态行为捕获能力。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

*Runqi Lin,Alasdair Paren,Suqin Yuan,Muyang Li,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中视觉越狱攻击的局限性，发现现有攻击方法存在跨模型迁移性差的问题，并提出了一种特征过度依赖校正（FORCE）方法来提高攻击的跨模型迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉越狱攻击虽然能够有效攻击开源MLLMs，但在跨模型迁移到闭源MLLMs时效果不佳。作者通过分析发现这些攻击位于高锐度区域，对参数变化敏感，且过度依赖特定层特征和语义贫乏的频率分量。

Method: 提出FORCE方法，通过引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域，并根据语义内容重新调整频率特征的影响，消除对层特征和频谱特征的非泛化依赖。

Result: 实验表明，FORCE方法能够显著提高视觉越狱攻击的跨模型迁移性，有效促进对闭源MLLMs的红队评估。

Conclusion: 通过校正特征过度依赖问题，FORCE方法为视觉越狱攻击发现了平坦的可行区域，从而提升了攻击的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RL微调为何能比SFT更好地提升LLM能力，特别是理解RL如何改变不同LLM的内部工作机制。

Method: 使用边缘归因修补技术分析多个模型家族在RL微调前后的内部差异，比较PPO、GRPO和DPO等不同RL方法的效果。

Result: 在线RL训练导致两个稳健效应：激活强度整体增加和激活模式多样性提高；DPO方法表现出较弱或不一致的内部变化。

Conclusion: RL通过重塑信息流使其更具冗余性和灵活性，从而提升泛化能力；在线RL与基于偏好的方法存在显著的方法论差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

Abstract: We study the problem of building an efficient learning system. Efficient
learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that
reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations.
Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the
Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning
$\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths
in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

Conclusion: 几何指代表达理解是几何问题求解的基础能力，现有MLLM模型在此任务上表现不佳，需要专门评估和加强几何基础能力。

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

Conclusion: SATMC通过同时考虑结构和属性变换，有效解决了图域自适应中的结构异质性问题，在跨网络节点分类任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The

Conclusion: ScaleDiff管道能够有效转移高级推理能力，无需依赖更大更昂贵的教师模型，并观察到随着困难问题数量增加，模型在困难基准上的性能呈现明显扩展现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Motivation: 现有的MLA解码内核使用absorb方法最小化HBM带宽使用，但其计算密集型特性无法利用注意力计算中的数据重用机会（如共享前缀）

Method: 提出混合方法，对注意力计算的计算密集型部分使用naive公式，对非共享部分使用absorb公式以减少带宽需求

Result: 在NPU和GPU上分别实现最高3倍和3.24倍的吞吐量提升，HBM大小仅增加3%的开销

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA通过混合方法有效平衡了计算效率和带宽使用，显著提升了MLA架构的性能

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

Motivation: 解决图学习中模型如何泛化到新图的问题，现有方法局限于单图、转导式设置，缺乏对归纳泛化的系统性评估。

Method: 生成具有持久语义社区的图家族，控制结构属性如同质性和度分布，实现对分布偏移的鲁棒性测试。

Result: 基准测试显示转导性能不能预测归纳泛化，鲁棒性对模型架构和初始图状态高度敏感。

Conclusion: GraphUniverse的灵活性和可扩展性有助于开发真正可泛化的架构，包括下一代图基础模型。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

*Xiefeng Wu,Jing Zhao,Shu Zhang,Mingyu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VARL是一个利用视觉语言模型为强化学习代理提供动作建议的框架，通过增加样本多样性来提高样本效率，特别是在稀疏奖励任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中需要大量交互步骤，而现有的视觉语言动作策略在低层控制方面表现有限，且需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: VARL框架利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习代理提供动作建议，而不是设计启发式奖励，从而保证最优性和收敛性不变。

Result: 在不同环境和代理设置下的评估表明，VARL显著提高了样本效率，且没有引入显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在真实世界环境中直接从零开始应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

*Wei Huang,De-Tian Chu,Lin-Yuan Bai,Wei Kang,Hai-Tao Zhang,Bo Li,Zhi-Mo Han,Jing Ge,Hai-Feng Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMail是一个自演化的认知代理框架，通过构建异构邮件图融合文本、元数据和嵌入资源，使用认知图神经网络和LLM进行上下文感知推理，并通过红蓝对抗团队实现持续进化，在检测精度、适应性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击已超越传统关键词黑名单和简单启发式方法，攻击者使用多模态策略结合自然语言文本、混淆URL、伪造头部和恶意附件，传统检测系统难以整合异构信号和持续适应。

Method: 构建统一异构邮件图融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；使用认知图神经网络增强LLM进行上下文感知推理；建立红蓝对抗自演化循环，红队生成新规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Result: 在真实数据集和合成对抗变体上的实验表明，EvoMail在检测精度、对演化垃圾邮件策略的适应性和推理轨迹可解释性方面一致优于最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为对抗下一代垃圾邮件和钓鱼威胁的弹性和可解释防御框架具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色但容易受到对抗性攻击，需要简单有效的数据适应防御方法。

Method: 使用稀疏主成分分析(SPCA)作为前端特征提取器，结合理论分析推导鲁棒性证书，并通过实验比较SPCA与标准PCA在对抗性攻击下的表现。

Result: SPCA在强白盒和黑盒攻击下比PCA表现更稳健，同时保持竞争力的清洁准确率。理论分析表明稀疏投影减少了对抗性杠杆效应。

Conclusion: 稀疏投影通过降低对抗性杠杆效应提高模型鲁棒性，这一优势在线性和非线性设置中都得到验证。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LAVA是一种后处理模型无关方法，用于解释无监督黑盒模型的局部嵌入结构，通过分析输入特征与潜在空间组织的关系来揭示特征关联模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型虽然能驱动科学发现，但难以解释。现有解释方法要么过于细粒度，要么过于简化，无法有效揭示潜在空间的组织结构，特别是对于不产生映射函数的流形学习方法。

Method: LAVA将潜在空间表示为一系列局部邻域，通过分析原始特征之间的相关性来描述这些邻域，然后揭示整个潜在空间中重复出现的相关性模式。

Result: 基于MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集的UMAP嵌入，LAVA能够捕捉相关的特征关联，在看似遥远的潜在空间区域之间发现视觉和生物学相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA提供了一种有效的方法来解释无监督学习的潜在空间结构，有助于科学发现和理解复杂数据的内在组织。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，通过多模态tokenization策略解决文本引导CAD原型设计中LLM tokenizer无法捕捉CAD语义的问题，显著提升了指令跟随和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD模型由构造序列定义，文本引导CAD原型设计可统一文本到CAD生成和CAD编辑流程。但现有LLM tokenizer将CAD序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉原始级CAD语义和几何结构。

Method: 提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，使用基于序列的VQ-VAE，采用原始级池化和约束解码，生成紧凑、原始感知的表示，与CAD的结构特性对齐。

Result: 在统一文本引导CAD原型设计中，CAD-Tokenizer显著改善了指令跟随和生成质量，在定量和定性评估上都优于通用LLM和任务特定基线。

Conclusion: 多模态tokenization策略能提供更有效的CAD表示，CAD-Tokenizer框架为文本引导CAD原型设计提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明GRPO强化学习算法在特定条件下会诱导出非平凡的过程奖励模型(PRM)，并提出了改进算法λ-GRPO来解决GRPO目标中的缺陷，在保持训练成本几乎不变的情况下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索GRPO算法中隐藏的过程奖励模型结构，质疑显式定义PRM的成本优势，寻求更高效的训练方法。

Method: 首先理论证明GRPO诱导PRM的条件，然后实证验证这些条件在现实场景中成立。基于GRPO-as-a-PRM框架识别算法缺陷，提出λ-GRPO改进方案。

Result: λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确率和下游推理任务上表现优于标准GRPO，且达到峰值性能更快。

Conclusion: 研究表明可以利用GRPO算法内置的隐藏PRM结构来提升性能，无需依赖成本高昂的显式PRM定义。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于f-散度的统一框架，用于文本到图像扩散模型的机器遗忘，相比传统的MSE方法具有更好的灵活性和性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型遗忘方法主要依赖均方误差（MSE），但这种方法只是f-散度框架的一个特例，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 构建统一的f-散度框架，允许使用任何f-散度来衡量目标概念和锚概念输出分布之间的差异，从而优化遗忘过程。

Result: 分析表明不同f-散度会影响算法的收敛性和遗忘质量，提供了在激进遗忘和概念保留之间平衡的选择空间。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为特定应用选择最优散度提供了灵活范式，能够更好地平衡遗忘效果和概念保护之间的权衡。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DATS（Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling）的新方法，用于解决持续学习中的校准问题，通过距离感知的温度缩放来适应不同任务，提高模型的不确定性校准能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，现有方法主要关注预测性能而忽视了不确定性校准的重要性。传统方法使用单一温度参数无法适应不同任务间的差异，导致校准误差波动较大。

Method: 提出DATS方法，结合基于原型的距离估计和距离感知校准，在没有先验任务信息的情况下推断任务接近度并分配自适应温度参数。

Result: 在标准基准测试和真实世界不平衡生物医学数据集上的实验表明，DATS方法在减少跨任务校准误差方面比现有方法更稳定、可靠和一致。

Conclusion: DATS方法有效解决了持续学习中的校准问题，通过距离感知的温度缩放机制显著提高了模型的不确定性校准能力。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

TL;DR: MoT是一种在异构专家模型间进行潜在层协作的方法，通过轻量级路由器选择专家并在共享潜在空间中进行交叉注意力，实现多LLM协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源LLM越来越专业化，需要利用不同模型的互补优势。现有方法要么路由到少数专家独立生成，要么通过多轮交换聚合输出，要么融合权重但需要架构同质性。

Method: 使用轻量级路由器为每个查询选择top-K专家并指定主专家，在共享潜在空间中主专家对活跃专家进行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，只训练路由器和交互层。

Result: 在5个分布内和3个分布外基准测试中，MoT超越了当前最先进的Avengers方法，分别提升0.38%和2.92%，且显著优于单个最佳模型。

Conclusion: MoT提供了一种简单的潜在空间机制来组合异构LLM，是实现更广泛多LLM协作的实用步骤。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简化逆强化学习的新方法，将最大熵IRL转化为两个现成的监督学习问题：概率分类和行为策略估计，以及迭代回归求解固定点方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆强化学习方法涉及复杂的内部优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，限制了现代函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。本文旨在简化IRL流程，使其更易于实现和扩展。

Method: 通过分析发现最大似然解可由涉及行为策略的线性固定点方程表征，将IRL分解为：1）概率分类估计行为策略；2）迭代回归求解固定点。该方法简单模块化，适用于各种函数逼近器。

Result: 提供了最优解的精确特征描述、通用算法、有限样本误差界限，实验结果表明在性能上与传统MaxEnt IRL相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法显著简化了逆强化学习的实现复杂度，使其能够更好地利用现代函数逼近器的表达能力，为IRL在机器人模仿学习和经济学选择建模等领域的应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

TL;DR: TimeRCD是一种基于相对上下文差异预训练范式的时序异常检测基础模型，通过检测相邻时间窗口的差异来识别异常，在零样本场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重构的时序异常检测基础模型存在目标不匹配问题：难以识别细微异常且容易误判复杂正常模式，导致高假阴性和假阳性率。

Method: 提出相对上下文差异预训练范式，训练模型检测相邻时间窗口的显著差异而非重构输入；使用标准Transformer架构，并构建大规模合成语料库进行预训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimeRCD在零样本时序异常检测中显著优于现有通用和异常专用基础模型。

Conclusion: RCD范式为构建鲁棒且可泛化的时序异常检测基础模型提供了新的有效路径。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

Result: 获得了参数范数缩放规律的闭式预测，发现DLNs继承了相同的肘点/阈值规律，为显式和隐式偏置之间建立了预测桥梁。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ℓp偏置插值下参数范数的统一缩放规律，表明泛化代理指标的预测能力对所使用的ℓr范数高度敏感。

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

Motivation: 在长期多轮智能体任务中，仅依赖结果奖励的方法存在监督信号稀疏的问题，需要更有效的训练方法

Method: Tree-GRPO方法将每个树节点表示为完整的智能体交互步骤，通过共享公共前缀增加采样效率，利用树结构轨迹构建逐步过程监督信号，并在树内和树间层面估计分组相对优势

Result: 在11个数据集和3类QA任务上的实验表明，基于树的强化学习方法优于基于链的方法

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO通过树搜索和分组相对策略优化有效解决了多轮智能体任务中的监督稀疏问题，为LLM的智能体能力提升提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LoRA技术使得大语言模型能够高效获取领域知识，但理解这种微调机制如何改变模型的结构推理和语义行为仍然是一个开放挑战。

Method: 构建了生物信息学工具领域的异质知识图谱BioToolKG，设计了基于反事实的微调LLM解释器（CFFTLLMExplainer），通过学习图节点和边的软掩码来生成最小结构扰动以诱导最大语义分歧。

Result: 将该框架应用于基于LLaMA的微调LLM，发现反事实掩码能够揭示模型的结构依赖性，并与LoRA诱导的参数变化相一致。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解微调LLM的内部机制提供了新视角，并强调反事实图作为可解释AI的潜在工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

Conclusion: GWTF为去中心化大语言模型训练提供了实用的解决方案，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

TL;DR: AirPCM是一个新颖的深度时空预测模型，通过整合多区域多污染物动态与显式气象-污染物因果关系建模，实现精准可扩展的空气污染预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球性紧迫问题，现有方法局限于单一污染物或局部区域，难以处理复杂的多污染物相互作用、变化的气象条件和区域空间异质性

Method: 采用统一架构联合捕捉跨站点空间相关性、时间自相关性和气象-污染物动态因果关系，支持细粒度可解释的多污染物预测

Conclusion: AirPCM的长期预测能力为未来空气质量趋势和潜在高风险窗口提供可操作的见解，为基于证据的环境治理和碳减排规划提供及时支持

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了联邦流匹配（FFM）框架，用于在隐私约束下训练流匹配模型，解决了分布式数据无法集中训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据分散在设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和法规限制阻止了数据集中化，因此需要在不进行中心化聚合的情况下直接从分布式数据本地训练生成模型。

Method: 提出了三种方法：FFM-vanilla（客户端使用独立源和目标耦合进行本地训练）、FFM-LOT（使用局部最优传输耦合提高单个客户端内的流直线性）和FFM-GOT（基于最优传输半对偶公式的联邦策略，通过共享全局势函数协调客户端间的耦合）。

Result: 在合成和图像数据集上的实验表明，FFM能够在保护隐私的同时提高联邦设置下的流直线性和样本质量，性能与集中式基线相当。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功实现了在隐私约束下的联邦流匹配训练，通过全局协调机制解决了数据异构性问题，达到了与集中式训练相当的性能。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了概率平滑策略优化（PSPO）方法，通过平滑当前策略概率来替代传统的比率裁剪，在保持梯度信号的同时创建软信任区域，显著提升语言模型在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法如PPO和GRPO依赖比率裁剪来稳定更新，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。需要一种既能防止不稳定更新又能保留梯度信息的方法。

Method: 提出PSPO方法，在计算重要性比率之前将当前策略的概率向旧策略平滑，类似于标签平滑。将PSPO实例化到GRPO中形成GR-PSPO，并在Qwen2.5模型上进行微调。

Result: 相比未裁剪的GRPO，GR-PSPO获得相似性能但产生更清晰、简洁和逻辑性更强的推理过程。相比裁剪的GRPO，GR-PSPO在0.5B和1.5B模型上性能大幅提升，GSM8K任务上分别提升超过20%（39.7% vs 17.6%和59.4% vs 37.8%）。

Conclusion: PSPO通过概率平滑有效替代比率裁剪，在保持训练稳定性的同时显著提升模型性能，特别是在数学推理任务上表现出色，为语言模型强化学习训练提供了更优的优化方法。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了神经网络训练数据记忆化带来的隐私安全问题，通过理论证明和实证研究揭示了现有重建方法的固有局限性，发现没有先验知识时存在无限多替代解，且训练更充分的网络反而更不易受重建攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对训练数据的记忆化引发了严重的隐私和安全担忧，虽然已有方法能够从模型参数重建部分训练数据，但这些攻击的可靠性缺乏坚实的理论基础，需要深入分析其固有弱点。

Method: 采用理论分析和实证验证相结合的方法，首先严格证明在没有数据先验知识时存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解，然后通过实验展示训练样本的精确复制只是偶然现象。

Result: 研究发现重建攻击在理论上不可靠，训练更充分的网络（满足隐式偏差条件更强）实际上更不容易受到重建攻击，这调和了隐私保护与强泛化需求之间的矛盾。

Conclusion: 该研究完善了训练集泄露可能性的理论理解，为缓解重建攻击提供了新见解，表明更强的泛化能力反而有助于保护隐私。

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SuperOffload系统，针对Superchip异构架构优化LLM训练，通过自适应权重卸载等技术实现2.5倍吞吐量提升，支持在单个Superchip上训练250亿参数模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superchip作为新一代AI硬件，将GPU和CPU紧密集成在同一封装中，但现有研究未充分探索LLM训练如何受益于此架构。传统卸载方案基于松散耦合的GPU-CPU架构假设，不适用于Superchip的紧密耦合特性。

Method: SuperOffload系统结合了自适应权重卸载、桶化重分区、Superchip感知类型转换、推测执行等技术，并为Grace CPU优化了Adam优化器。系统还扩展支持ZeRO风格数据并行和DeepSpeed-Ulysses序列并行。

Result: 在NVIDIA GH200上的评估显示，相比最先进的卸载系统，SuperOffload实现最高2.5倍吞吐量提升，支持在单个Superchip上训练250亿参数模型。在8个GH200上可训练130亿参数模型，序列长度达100万token，达到55%模型FLOPs利用率。

Conclusion: SuperOffload证明了Superchip架构在LLM训练中的巨大潜力，通过针对紧密耦合异构架构的专门优化，显著提升了训练效率和模型规模支持能力。

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法，用于计算广义线性模型的最优鲁棒追索，使用L^p范数（p≥1但p≠∞）来约束模型变化，相比之前使用L^∞范数的方法显著降低了追索成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒追索方法使用L^∞范数衡量模型变化，可能导致追索成本过高。本文旨在通过使用更约束的L^p范数来解决这一缺陷。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，能够可证明地计算广义线性模型的最优鲁棒追索，针对L^p范数约束的模型变化进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，该算法相比先前工作显著降低了追索成本（可达几个数量级），在追索实施成本与有效性之间实现了更好的权衡，且提供了更稀疏的追索方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在保持对后处理方法的鲁棒性的同时，提供了成本更低、更稀疏的追索解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

Models), an open-source Python toolkit designed for rapid experimental
iteration of LLM-based data extraction pipelines and for quantifying the
trade-offs between them. DELM minimizes boilerplate code and offers a modular
framework with structured outputs, built-in validation, flexible data-loading
and scoring strategies, and efficient batch processing. It also includes robust
support for working with LLM APIs, featuring retry logic, result caching,
detailed cost tracking, and comprehensive configuration management. We showcase
DELM's capabilities through two case studies: one featuring a novel prompt
optimization algorithm, and another illustrating how DELM quantifies trade-offs
between cost and coverage when selecting keywords to decide which paragraphs to
pass to an LLM. DELM is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在减轻学者在分析大量比较语料库时的认知负担，为考古文物的溯源分析提供具体起点。

Method: 系统构建了一个双模态知识库，包含参考文本和图像，支持原始视觉、边缘增强和语义检索，以识别风格相似的文物。检索到的候选对象由VLM合成，生成结构化的推断，包括年代、地理和文化归属以及解释性理由。

Result: 在英国博物馆的东欧亚青铜时代文物集上进行了评估，专家评估表明系统能够产生有意义且可解释的输出。

Conclusion: 该系统为学者提供了具体的分析起点，显著减轻了导航大量比较语料库的认知负担。

Abstract: In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system
for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert
reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models
(VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts
and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to
identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by
the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological,
geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications.
We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from
the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces
meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting
points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of
navigating vast comparative corpora.

### [244] [Performance Consistency of Learning Methods for Information Retrieval Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20804)
*Meng Yuan,Justin Zobel*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文通过实验发现基于Transformer的IR模型在不同随机种子下性能波动巨大，而传统统计模型表现稳定，质疑了以往基于微小性能差异声称模型改进的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究信息检索方法性能评估的可靠性，特别是针对依赖随机种子的机器学习方法，验证不同评估方法对性能稳定性的影响。

Method: 使用三种不同的IR任务，通过随机种子变化来评估传统统计学习模型和基于Transformer的学习模型的性能波动，采用bootstrap方法和随机种子集来检验性能变异。

Result: 统计模型表现稳定，而Transformer模型在种子变化时显示出巨大波动：11个案例中有9个的F1分数标准差超过0.075，11个案例中有7个的精确率标准差超过0.125。

Conclusion: Transformer模型对训练不稳定性高度敏感，以往基于小于0.02差异声称方法改进的结果可靠性存疑，强调了严格评估实践的必要性。

Abstract: A range of approaches have been proposed for estimating the accuracy or
robustness of the measured performance of IR methods. One is to use
bootstrapping of test sets, which, as we confirm, provides an estimate of
variation in performance. For IR methods that rely on a seed, such as those
that involve machine learning, another approach is to use a random set of seeds
to examine performance variation. Using three different IR tasks we have used
such randomness to examine a range of traditional statistical learning models
and transformer-based learning models. While the statistical models are stable,
the transformer models show huge variation as seeds are changed. In 9 of 11
cases the F1-scores (in the range 0.0--1.0) had a standard deviation of over
0.075; while 7 of 11 precision values (also in the range 0.0--1.0) had a
standard deviation of over 0.125. This is in a context where differences of
less than 0.02 have been used as evidence of method improvement. Our findings
highlight the vulnerability of transformer models to training instabilities and
moreover raise questions about the reliability of previous results, thus
underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation practices.

TL;DR: FORGE是一个针对生成式检索中语义标识符构建的综合性基准测试，解决了当前研究面临的三大挑战：缺乏大规模多模态数据集、SID生成优化策略有限、工业部署收敛慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义标识符研究面临三个主要挑战：(1)缺乏大规模公开多模态数据集；(2)SID生成优化策略研究有限，通常依赖昂贵的GR训练进行评估；(3)工业部署中在线收敛速度慢。

Method: 提出FORGE基准测试，包含从淘宝平台采样的140亿用户交互和2.5亿商品多模态特征的数据集。探索多种SID构建优化策略，并提出两个与推荐性能正相关的新型SID评估指标，无需GR训练即可进行便捷评估。

Result: 离线实验验证了优化策略的有效性，在线分析显示交易量增加0.35%。提出的新型SID指标与推荐性能正相关，离线预训练方案使在线收敛时间减半。

Conclusion: FORGE为语义标识符研究提供了全面的基准测试和数据集，提出的优化策略和评估方法在工业场景中具有显著实用价值，能够有效提升推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Semantic identifiers (SIDs) have gained increasing attention in generative
retrieval (GR) due to their meaningful semantic discriminability. However,
current research on SIDs faces three main challenges: (1) the absence of
large-scale public datasets with multimodal features, (2) limited investigation
into optimization strategies for SID generation, which typically rely on costly
GR training for evaluation, and (3) slow online convergence in industrial
deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FORGE, a comprehensive
benchmark for FOrming semantic identifieR in Generative rEtrieval with
industrial datasets. Specifically, FORGE is equipped with a dataset comprising
14 billion user interactions and multimodal features of 250 million items
sampled from Taobao, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in China.
Leveraging this dataset, FORGE explores several optimizations to enhance the
SID construction and validates their effectiveness via offline experiments
across different settings and tasks. Further online analysis conducted on our
platform, which serves over 300 million users daily, reveals a 0.35% increase
in transaction count, highlighting the practical impact of our method.
Regarding the expensive SID validation accompanied by the full training of GRs,
we propose two novel metrics of SID that correlate positively with
recommendation performance, enabling convenient evaluations without any GR
training. For real-world applications, FORGE introduces an offline pretraining
schema that reduces online convergence by half. The code and data are available
at https://github.com/selous123/al_sid.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的MarkupLM++模型，用于从购物评论网站提取产品信息，通过扩展DOM树内部节点的预测来提高信息提取精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建最新的产品数据库对于电子商务系统至关重要，需要从购物评论网站中提取详细信息来支持客户分析和产品推荐等任务。

Method: 首先在从不同规模的评论网站收集的产品数据上微调MarkupLM模型，然后开发了MarkupLM++变体，将预测扩展到DOM树的内部节点。

Result: 实验表明，使用更大更多样化的训练集总体上提高了提取精度。包含内部节点有助于某些产品属性的提取，但导致整体性能略有下降。最终模型的精确度为0.906，召回率为0.724，F1得分为0.805。

Conclusion: MarkupLM++模型在Web信息提取任务中表现良好，通过扩展DOM树内部节点的预测能力，为电子商务系统的产品数据库构建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Web information extraction (WIE) is an important part of many e-commerce
systems, supporting tasks like customer analysis and product recommendation. In
this work, we look at the problem of building up-to-date product databases by
extracting detailed information from shopping review websites. We fine-tuned
MarkupLM on product data gathered from review sites of different sizes and then
developed a variant we call MarkupLM++, which extends predictions to internal
nodes of the DOM tree. Our experiments show that using larger and more diverse
training sets improves extraction accuracy overall. We also find that including
internal nodes helps with some product attributes, although it leads to a
slight drop in overall performance. The final model reached a precision of
0.906, recall of 0.724, and an F1 score of 0.805.

### [248] [Rejuvenating Cross-Entropy Loss in Knowledge Distillation for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20989)
*Zhangchi Zhu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文分析了推荐系统中知识蒸馏的交叉熵损失，揭示了CE损失与NDCG之间的联系，并提出RCE-KD方法来解决理论假设与实际目标之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推荐系统的知识蒸馏中，目标是蒸馏教师模型对最可能被偏好的物品的排序，但只能在小规模物品子集上计算。研究发现当在物品子集上进行KD时，最小化CE损失仅在满足闭合假设时才能最大化NDCG的下界，但这与蒸馏教师模型顶级物品排序的目标相矛盾。

Method: 提出RCE-KD方法：将教师模型给出的顶级物品根据学生模型是否高度排名分为两个子集；对于不满足条件的子集，设计采样策略利用师生协作来近似闭合假设；自适应地结合两个子集上的损失。

Result: 广泛的实验证明了该方法的有效性，能够有效弥合理想目标与理论支持之间的差距。

Conclusion: RCE-KD方法成功解决了推荐系统知识蒸馏中CE损失的理论局限性，通过师生协作采样策略有效提升了蒸馏性能。

Abstract: This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD)
for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling
rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be
computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the
connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when
performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound
of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the
item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our
goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically
demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the
gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated
Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items
given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked
by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy
is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption
of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.

TL;DR: IntSR是一个集成搜索和推荐的生成式框架，通过不同的查询模态统一处理显式用户请求和隐式用户兴趣，解决了集成S&R带来的计算复杂度增加和动态语料库导致的错误模式学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐系统主要关注检索和排序的统一，但忽视了搜索和推荐任务的集成。搜索使用显式用户请求，推荐依赖隐式用户兴趣，两者在查询形成方式上存在本质差异。

Method: 提出IntSR框架，使用不同的查询模态来集成搜索和推荐任务，解决集成S&R行为带来的计算复杂度增加问题，以及动态变化语料库引入的错误模式学习问题。

Result: IntSR在Amap的多个场景中成功部署，显著提升了数字资产GMV(+3.02%)、POI推荐CTR(+2.76%)和出行方式建议ACC(+5.13%)。

Conclusion: IntSR证明了通过查询作为核心元素来集成搜索和推荐任务的可行性，为生成式推荐系统提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating
remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications.
However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking
while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What
makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search
uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user
interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to
whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as
central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R.
IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also
addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R
behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically
changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios
in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%),
POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为交互式推荐流（IRF）的新范式，通过自然语言命令让用户主动控制推荐策略，解决了传统推荐系统被动反馈机制的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖被动反馈机制（如喜欢/不喜欢），这些粗粒度的信号无法捕捉用户细微的行为动机和意图，也无法识别具体哪些物品属性驱动用户满意或不满意，导致偏好建模不准确，造成用户意图与系统解释之间的差距。

Method: 开发了RecBot双智能体架构：解析器智能体将语言表达转换为结构化偏好，规划器智能体动态编排自适应工具链进行实时策略调整。采用模拟增强的知识蒸馏方法实现高效部署。

Result: 通过大量离线和长期在线实验，RecBot在用户满意度和业务成果方面都显示出显著改善。

Conclusion: IRF范式通过自然语言交互解决了传统推荐系统的根本局限性，为用户提供了主动明确的推荐控制能力，显著提升了系统效果。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.
