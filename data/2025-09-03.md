Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署的挑战，提供了轻量且高效的图像-文本检索解决方案

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MESTI新动态输入模态和MEGANet网络，结合两者在微表情识别任务上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入模态（Apex Frame、光流、动态图像）难以充分捕捉微表情的细微短暂特征，导致识别性能不佳

Method: 提出MESTI将视频序列转换为单图像并保留微运动特征，设计MEGANet网络包含梯度注意力块来增强细粒度运动特征提取

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到最高准确率，MESTI替换现有网络输入能带来一致性能提升

Conclusion: MESTI是优越的输入模态，MEGANet是先进的识别网络，为更有效的微表情识别系统铺平道路

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

### [6] [Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)
*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion是一种基于离散扩散语言模型的生成模型，专门用于生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构，在98%以上稀疏度的数据上仍能生成真实连贯的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成真实的稀疏多类别3D体素结构面临两个主要挑战：体素结构的立方内存缩放问题，以及由稀疏性导致的严重类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将体素视为token，使用离散扩散语言模型来生成3D体素结构，将离散扩散扩展到非序列化的空间领域。

Result: 在Minecraft房屋结构数据集上评估，相比之前的基线方法和自回归方法，Scaffold Diffusion能够生成更真实和连贯的结构，即使在超过98%稀疏度的数据上训练也能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 离散扩散为3D稀疏体素生成建模提供了一个有前景的框架，能够有效处理高度稀疏的3D结构生成问题。

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SGLC框架解决高分辨率图像去雾问题，通过全局特征生成器和局部特征增强器的组合，有效融合全局上下文信息和局部细节，显著提升PSNR指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾模型主要针对低分辨率图像，高分辨率图像处理时通常需要下采样或分块处理，导致性能显著下降，主要原因是难以有效结合全局上下文信息和局部精细细节

Method: 提出SGLC框架，包含全局特征生成器(GFG)和局部特征增强器(LFE)。GFG生成初步去雾结果，关注场景的全局上下文理解；LFE细化初步输出，增强局部细节和像素级特征，捕捉全局外观与局部结构的相互作用

Result: 在高分辨率数据集上的实验结果显示，使用SGLC后峰值信噪比(PSNR)有显著提升，表明其在处理大规模雾化图像方面的有效性

Conclusion: SGLC设计是模型无关的，任何去雾网络都可以通过这种全局-局部特征融合机制进行增强，使实践者能够同时利用场景级线索和细粒度细节，显著提高高分辨率环境下的视觉保真度

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了首个大规模自监督异常检测模型用于肾脏毒理病理学，通过UNI基础模型提取特征并采用自监督方法，在158种化合物的药物安全性评估研究中实现了优于随机水平的异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾脏异常检测是临床前药物开发的关键环节，但传统方法需要人工检查数百到数千张全切片图像，耗时耗力且成本高昂。大多数图像都是正常的，需要检测细微的毒性变化。

Method: 使用UNI基础模型提取特征，发现简单的k近邻分类器性能不佳。随后采用自监督方法对相同特征进行处理，实现了更好的异常检测性能。

Result: 自监督方法在接收器操作特征曲线下面积达到0.62，阴性预测值达到89%，显著优于随机水平。

Conclusion: 这种模型有潜力在药物安全性评估研究中排除正常切片，从而显著降低药物开发的时间和成本，具有重要的应用前景。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了提升VLLMs在复杂环境中稳健性的重要性，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过生成扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，再结合视觉模型进行图像检索的两步方法，有效弥合了文本和图像在表示空间中的模态差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CLIP等视觉语言模型提供了开放词汇的文本到图像检索方案，但文本和图像在表示空间中存在较大距离，限制了检索性能。需要弥合这种模态差距。

Method: 采用两步方法：1）使用生成扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询；2）使用视觉模型估计图像间相似度。还引入了聚合网络来融合多张生成图像和不同模态的相似度分数。

Result: 经过广泛评估，该方法在文本到图像检索任务中始终优于仅依赖文本查询的检索方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉编码器、视觉语言模型和文本到图像生成模型的最新进展，提出的方法有效提升了文本到图像检索的性能，弥合了模态差距。

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM基准测试和Safe-LLaVA数据集为解决多模态大语言模型中生物特征信息泄露问题提供了首个全面的评估框架和隐私保护训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言任务时经常推断和泄露敏感的生物特征信息（如种族、性别、年龄等），即使这些信息没有被明确请求，这在现实应用和社会敏感领域引发了严重隐私担忧。

Method: 提出了PRISM基准测试来评估模型在两个方面的表现：拒绝生物特征相关查询的能力，以及在保持语义忠实度的同时避免一般响应中隐含的生物特征泄露。同时开发了Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统地从LLaVA数据集中移除显性和隐性的生物特征信息来构建隐私保护训练数据集。

Result: 评估发现不同MLLM模型在各种生物特征属性上都存在泄露问题。通过在Safe-LLaVA数据集上微调模型，显著减少了生物特征信息的泄露。

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA和PRISM为MLLM的隐私对齐开发和评估设立了新标准，提供了首个公开可用的生物特征泄露评估基准和隐私保护训练数据集。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEME是一个新颖的跨模态对齐方法，通过构建自我中心的世界模型来增强视觉语言模型在动态环境中的时空推理能力，在导航和问答任务上取得了1%-3%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在静态场景理解方面表现出色，但在动态开放环境中的时空推理和适应能力有限，缺乏对细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解的建模。

Method: 提出VEME框架，包含三个核心组件：跨模态对齐框架连接对象、空间表示和视觉语义；动态隐式认知地图实现任务相关的几何语义记忆召回；基于指令的导航推理框架利用具身先验进行长期规划。

Result: 在VSI-Bench和VLN-CE基准测试中，相比传统方法实现了1%-3%的准确率和探索效率提升。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，该方法显著提升了动态环境中的推理和规划能力，为具身智能的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶状肿瘤在影像学上与良性纤维腺瘤相似，术前分类困难，常导致不必要的手术切除，需要开发更准确的诊断方法

Method: 开发双分支神经网络，从81例确诊患者的超声图像和临床数据中提取并融合特征，采用类别感知采样和分层5折交叉验证防止类别不平衡和数据泄露

Conclusion: 多模态AI有潜力作为非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要活检，改善乳腺肿瘤管理的临床决策

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

### [15] [A High-Accuracy Fast Hough Transform with Linear-Log-Cubed Computational Complexity for Arbitrary-Shaped Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00231)
*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FHT2SP算法，在保持恒定有界误差的同时实现近最优计算复杂度，解决了传统快速Hough变换算法在精度和效率之间的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的快速Hough变换算法要么计算复杂度低但精度随尺度恶化，要么精度高但计算成本接近立方复杂度，需要找到两者之间的平衡点

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念进行扩展，突破原始幂次方约束，将其集成到FHT2DT算法中，通过适当选择超像素尺寸实现优化

Result: FHT2SP算法达到近最优计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持与图像尺寸无关的恒定有界近似误差，可通过元参数控制

Conclusion: 该算法成功解决了Hough变换中计算效率与精度之间的经典权衡问题，为各种应用领域提供了高效且精确的解决方案

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种语言导向的生成式视觉系统，用于制造业中的残余轮廓检测，通过条件GAN和视觉-语言模型实现了CAD级别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统遇到噪声、材料变异性和非控制成像条件的挑战，限制了传统边缘检测器和手工管道的效果。

Method: 系统分为三个阶段：数据获取和预处理、使用条件GAN进行轮廓生成、以及通过视觉-语言模型进行多模态轮廓精炼。采用人在循环过程制作标准化提示词。

Result: 在FabTrack数据集上，系统提高了轮廓保真度，增强了边缘连续性和几何对齐，减少了手工追踪。GPT-image-1在结构准确性和感知质量方面都超过Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了VLM导向的生成式工作流在推进工业计算机视觉超越传统管道限制方面的潜力。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

*Ghassen Baklouti,Maxime Zanella,Ismail Ben Ayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的基于信息论的transductive few-shot学习方法LIMO，通过结合视觉-文本互信息、KL散度惩罚和交叉熵损失，在CLIP模型上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前transductive few-shot learning主要关注纯视觉模型，而在基础视觉-语言模型(VLMs)领域的研究仍处于起步阶段。现有的少数方法表明transductive方法在VLMs中具有潜力，但需要专门针对VLM定制的方法。

Method: 提出了LIMO损失函数，包含三个互补项：(1)视觉输入与文本类别描述的互信息；(2)KL散度惩罚网络概率输出与文本驱动的零样本预测之间的偏差；(3)基于标注样本的标准交叉熵损失。同时探索了参数高效微调(PEFT)策略。

Result: LIMO大幅超越了近期transductive few-shot CLIP方法，相比最佳inductive方法也取得了显著增益。令人惊讶的是，仅调整模型参数子集就能带来性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了信息论概念和PEFT策略在transductive few-shot学习中的有效性，为VLM领域的few-shot学习提供了新的研究方向和技术路径。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphGen通过整合组织病理学图像、核分割掩码和对比学习框架，专注于建模生物学上稳健的核形态和空间组织特征，提高了计算病理学中的域泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 计算病理学中的域泛化受到全切片图像异质性的阻碍，而病理学家依赖跨域不变的形态学特征进行诊断。受此启发，研究旨在开发对域偏移具有鲁棒性的癌症表示学习方法。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法，在监督对比学习框架中整合组织病理学图像、增强技术和核分割掩码，通过对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表示，优先考虑诊断特征而非染色伪影。还结合随机权重平均(SWA)来增强分布外鲁棒性。

Result: 注意力图分析显示MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类。该方法对图像损坏和对抗攻击表现出良好的鲁棒性，展示了优秀的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: MorphGen通过显式建模生物学稳健的形态学特征，成功解决了数字病理学中深度学习的域泛化挑战和关键脆弱性问题，为临床部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Method: 仅对视觉token进行剪枝，采用互信息基于的策略移除与文本token语义不对齐的视觉token，并通过最大化嵌入空间中预期成对距离来剪枝重复视觉token

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B模型上实现了token数量减少88.9%，推理速度提升56.7%，同时保持了强劲的性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过专注于视觉token剪枝，采用互信息和多样性保持策略，有效地减少了计算成本同时保持了模型性能

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了目标部署环境的文本描述这一可用资源，而这种文本元数据在实际应用中很容易获得。

Method: 提出STAR模块，利用CLIP等视觉-语言模型：1)通过目标文本嵌入构建子空间重定位图像特征 2)使用谱投影保留与目标线索对齐的方向 3)视觉-语言蓄粉对齐背榜特征 4)特征空间Mixup确保平滑迁移

Result: 在多个图像分类和目标检测数据集上验证了STAR的优劢性，显示出超过现有方法的表现。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了最小化的文本元数据在严重数据约束下仍能显著提升普通化能力，为在未见数据的目标环境中部署稳健模型开启了新方向。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Conclusion: ILRNet成功整合了模型驱动和数据驱动方法的优势，能够灵活有效地捕捉不同场景下的低秩特性，实现渐进式增强和优异的图像细节保持

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Result: VPFC方法能有效减少遗漏幻觉，同时不会引入额外的捏造幻觉。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前物体幻觉研究的关键疏忽，为开发更鲁棒和平衡的幻觉缓解策略指明了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个两阶段的VLM防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化增强模型鲁棒性，在保持视觉理解能力的同时有效防御对抗攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激活引导的VLM防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示来提取有害方向，性能次优且可能降低视觉接地性能，需要更有效的防御方案

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段从多样化数据源计算自适应层特定引导向量，在推理时抑制有害行为；第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化细化引导向量，整合自动毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励

Result: 实验表明SPO-VLM通过激活引导和偏好优化有效增强安全性，同时在良性任务上保持强性能且不损害视觉理解能力

Conclusion: SPO-VLM提供了一个平衡效率与有效性的防御框架，将轻量级缓解基础与深度策略优化相结合，为VLM安全防御提供了新思路

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: 该方法为任意模态基础模型到3D点云分析的适配提供了通用解决方案，有效解决了异构映射中的信息丢失问题。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

TL;DR: 提出NoiseCutMix方法，将CutMix概念引入扩散模型的噪声估计过程，生成自然融合两个类别特征的高分辨率图像用于数据增强


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CutMix等方法在组合不同类别图像时会产生不自然的边界，而扩散模型能生成自然高分辨率图像，但缺乏类别融合能力

Method: 在扩散模型的噪声估计阶段，部分组合两个不同类别对应的估计噪声，从而生成具有两个类别融合特征的自然图像

Result: 在分类实验中验证了方法的有效性，相比传统多类别组合数据增强方法和随机图像生成方法表现更好

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix成功结合了扩散模型的高质量图像生成能力和CutMix的类别融合特性，为数据增强提供了新的有效方法

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

Conclusion: 提出的公平性算法有效解决了皮肤病变分类中的肤色偏见问题，具有较低的计算成本和更好的实用性，适合实际医疗应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法UDAKD和FSKD，利用自动驾驶场景中相机和LiDAR的时空同步数据，通过2D预训练模型向3D网络传递知识，无需3D标注即可实现3D LiDAR点云的语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D LiDAR点云语义分割需要大量标注数据，成本高昂且耗时。相比之下，2D图像数据集资源丰富且规模庞大，希望通过跨模态知识蒸馏来减少对3D标注的依赖。

Method: 提出UDAKD（无监督域适应知识蒸馏）和FSKD（基于特征和语义的知识蒸馏）两种方法。利用相机和LiDAR的时空同步数据，将预训练2D图像模型应用于未标注2D数据，通过已知的2D-3D对应关系进行跨模态知识蒸馏，使3D网络输出与2D网络对应点对齐。使用自校准卷积作为域适应模块的基础。

Conclusion: 所提出的跨模态知识蒸馏方法能够有效减少对3D标注数据的依赖，在保持模态通用信息的同时过滤掉模态特定细节，为3D LiDAR语义分割提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

Conclusion: NAME范式是推动叙事探究领域发展的首次尝试，能有效减轻研究者和参与者的认知负担，为叙事制作和呈现提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第一人称视频中频繁且突然的视角变化导致物体外观变化显著和部分遮挡，使得现有方法难以实现精确定位。

Method: 提出HERO-VQL方法，包含：1) 自上而下的注意力引导(TAG)，利用类别token获取高层上下文和主成分得分图进行细粒度定位；2) 基于第一人称增强的一致性训练(EgoACT)，通过替换查询对象和重排序视频帧来增强查询多样性并模拟极端视角变化。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的大量实验验证了HERO-VQL能有效处理第一人称挑战，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法受人类认知过程启发，通过创新的注意力机制和增强训练策略，成功解决了第一人称视觉查询定位中的关键挑战。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型(DCDM)用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数数量，适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建可减少患者辐射暴露和缩短检查时间，但会导致噪声增加和图像细节减少，降低图像质量。需要一种灵活的方法来处理不同剂量水平的重建问题。

Method: DCDM模型包含两个约束模块：核变换器约束(NTC)利用核范数作为矩阵秩最小化的近似，将低秩特性集成到Transformer架构中；编码连接约束(ENC)利用压缩特征表示来编码和控制预训练扩散模型。NTC从低剂量图像中提取信息并转换为潜在空间的压缩特征表示，ENC使用这些表示最终在像素空间获得重建的PET图像。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)方面优于最先进方法，并且在未知DRF场景下具有良好的泛化能力，即使在超低剂量水平(如全剂量的1%)也证明有价值。

Conclusion: DCDM通过冻结预训练模型权重和注入双约束控制器，实现了参数效率高的超低剂量PET重建，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需完全重新训练，在已知和未知剂量减少因子情况下都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Motivation: 全景视频在VR和遥感等领域应用广泛，但其广角视野常包含不需要的物体。现有视频修复方法主要针对普通窄视野视频，无法处理全景视频的投影畸变问题。

Method: 提出DAOVI模型，包含两个核心模块：1）基于测地线距离评估图像空间时序运动信息的模块；2）特征空间中处理几何畸变的深度感知特征传播模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI模型成功解决了全景视频修复中的几何畸变问题，为全景视频处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: 通过视频生成模型提供多视角监督信号，能够有效丰富未观测区域细节并正则化化身表示，减少伪影，提升人体化身重建质量。

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

Conclusion: 轻量级优化模型如MobileNet是建立可扩展、低成本、临床可行的NICU监测系统的最佳基础，为资源突出环境中改善早产儿护理抓手了路径。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Method: 采用两阶段加速策略：编码阶段使用金字塔令牌分层合并技术减少图像令牌数量；解码阶段通过KV缓存压缩移除不必要的缓存来提高网络吞吐量。

Result: 仅保留35%图像令牌时可保持100%性能，保留3%图像令牌时仍维持98%性能。网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍，长序列生成推理时间减少3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM有效解决了VLMs推理效率问题，使大型模型比小型模型推理更快，有望促进视觉语言模型的实际部署应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

TL;DR: SemaMIL是一个新的多实例学习方法，通过语义重排序和语义引导检索状态空间模块，在计算病理学中实现了最先进的准确率，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力机制MIL方法忽略了上下文关系，Transformer模型计算成本高且容易过拟合，状态空间模型虽然计算复杂度低但打乱补丁顺序会破坏组织学意义。

Method: 提出SemaMIL框架，包含语义重排序(SR)方法对语义相似的补丁进行聚类和排序，以及语义引导检索状态空间模块(SRSM)选择代表性查询子集来调整状态空间参数。

Result: 在四个WSI亚型数据集上的评估显示，SemaMIL相比强基线方法实现了最先进的准确率，同时使用更少的FLOPs和参数。

Conclusion: SemaMIL成功解决了现有MIL方法的局限性，在保持组织学意义和可解释性的同时，实现了更好的性能和更低的计算成本。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

TL;DR: 提出SA-LDL算法，通过分阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数，有效解决年龄估计中的标签模糊性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过标签分布学习建模相邻年龄组的相关性，但忽略了不同年龄阶段模糊程度的差异性

Method: 基于嵌入相似性分析发现标签模糊性呈现明显的阶段性模式，采用分阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数

Result: 在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别取得MAE 1.74和2.15的竞争性性能

Conclusion: SA-LDL算法能够有效捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构化特征，实现更准确鲁棒的年龄估计

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Motivation: 虽然基于学习的方法提高了可变形图像配准的精度和速度，但仍面临计算复杂度高和处理大变形等挑战。研究卷积神经网络在配准中的作用机制，以寻求更好的精度-效率权衡。

Method: 基于Horn-Schunck光流方程分析ConvNets的作用，提出EOIR框架：使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取，构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，通过3层光流估计器逐步组合微分同胚变形。

Result: 在5个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证，EOIR实现了优越的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡，在可比精度下提供更好的效率和平滑度。

Conclusion: EOIR框架通过分离特征学习和光流估计，有效解决了大变形配准问题，在多个数据集上表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是首个全面的视频多模态奖励模型基准测试，涵盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个核心维度，包含1,563个高质量标注样本，评估了28个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态奖励模型评估基准存在样本数量有限、评估维度不全面、模型类型覆盖不足等问题，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建包含1,563个标注样本的高质量偏好数据集，每个样本包含视频-文本提示、选择响应和拒绝响应的三元组，评估了生成式、判别式和半标量三类共28个模型。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到57.0%的总体准确率，开源最优模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B仅为53.3%。研究发现：RL训练的MRM不一定有更强的跨模态泛化能力；除判别式MRM外，其他类型模型可通过推理时缩放受益；不同视频帧数对不同类型MRM有不同影响。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域的多模态奖励模型评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准测试平台。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂场景中视频数据的爆炸式增长，快速检索群体活动成为迫切需求。现有方法只能检索整个视频，无法实现活动粒度的检索。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉时空演化特征。M-STVH作为增强版本，通过多焦点表示学习实现层次特征集成，能够同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上的对比实验表明，STVH和M-STVH都能取得优异的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的时空视频哈希技术有效解决了细粒度群体活动检索问题，M-STVH的多焦点学习机制进一步提升了模型对多样化检索需求的处理能力。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同超声设备采集的图像存在样式差异，导致下游任务性能下降。现有无配对图像翻译方法未能有效筛选最相关的样式特征，可能产生与下游任务需求不匹配的翻译结果

Method: 提出TRUST框架：1）Token-dRiven模块从数据视角选择合适的目标token，从模型视角识别最优目标token；2）使用行为镜像损失指导；3）在源编码器中注入辅助提示以匹配内容表示

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有UI2I方法

Conclusion: TRUST通过有效分离内容和样式特征，成功解决了跨设备超声图像翻译中的样式差异问题，显著提升了下游任务的性能表现

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

Motivation: AIaaS的兴起使得预训练模型通过API普及，但现有方法无法在无法获取模型权重、训练数据或logits的黑盒约束下进行有效的本地模型适应训练。

Method: 提出ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC)方法，利用DINOv2注意力图通过熵评分动态选择最优尺度进行黑盒模型推理，实现有效的伪标签蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个数据集上仅使用one-hot API预测就能显著提升黑盒监督下的性能表现。

Conclusion: ATGC成功解决了开放词汇模型在不同分辨率下的敏感性问题，为黑盒蒸馏提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

Motivation: 现有方法在类别增量语义分割中存在灾难性语义纠缠问题，包括原型-特征纠缠和背景-增量纠缠，导致显著噪声和错误

Method: 使用语言引导的原型解纠缠和流形互背景解纠缠，利用CLIP等预训练模型的先验语义指导特征解纠缠，并引入软提示调优和编码器适配

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上实现了最先进的性能，特别是在多步增量场景中表现优异

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，通过语言引导的特征解纠缠显著提升了增量学习性能

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现优异，但在未校准模态（如MRI）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向的差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出BrainFM模型，采用"轻度到重度"主体内生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观（如模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估，BrainFM在所有任务和输入模态中都表现出鲁棒性和有效性，能够直接应用于五种基本脑成像任务。

Conclusion: BrainFM为解决未校准医学成像模态的泛化问题提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度目标检测在具有挑战性的视觉领域（如车辆损伤评估）中极具挑战性。虽然DiffusionDet通过条件去噪扩散取得了进展，但其在上下文相关场景中的性能仍受限于局部特征条件化

Method: 引入Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)，利用交叉注意力机制将全局场景上下文与局部提案特征直接集成。使用单独的专用编码器生成全局上下文，捕获全面的环境信息，使每个目标提案能够关注场景级理解

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中相比最先进模型有显著提升，为细粒度领域的上下文感知目标检测建立了新的性能基准

Conclusion: 该框架通过使每个目标提案能够关注全面的环境信息，显著增强了生成式检测范式的性能，在上下文敏感的细粒度目标检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架有效解决了视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的迁移挑战，无需训练即可实现多层次的视觉-语言对齐，为遥感图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 新的MV-SSM框架通过状态空间模型和网格令牌双向扫描技术，解决了多视角3D人体姿估计中的泛化问题，在多个数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力机制在多视角3D人体姿估计中存在两个主要问题：一是难以准确建模关节点的空间排列，特别是在遮挡场景中；二是容易过拟合训练数据的特定摄像机配置和视觉场景，导致在新环境下性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出了多视角状态空间建模框架MV-SSM，在两个层次明确建模关节空间序列：来自多视角图像的特征层和人体关键点层。设计了投影状态空间(PSS)块来学习关节空间排列的泛化表征，并改进Mamba的传统扫描为网格令牌导向的双向扫描(GTBS)技术。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic数据集的挑战性三摄像机设置中，AP25指标提升了10.8分(+24%)；在变化摄像机配置下AP25提升了7.0分(+13%)；在跨数据集评估中Campus A1的PCP指标提升了15.3分(+38%)，都超过了现有最好方法。

Conclusion: MV-SSM框架通过状态空间建模和创新的扫描机制，有效解决了多视角3D人体姿估计中的泛化问题，在各种挑战性场景下都展现了显著的性能优势和稳健性。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

Conclusion: 该方法为翻译和口译人员提供了快速获取珠宝准确信息的有效工具，通过多层次的描述模拟了专家分析

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

<details>

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上存在缺陷，主要原因是单一视觉编码器架构牺牲了细粒度视觉信息捕获能力

Method: 提出FtZ视觉塔框架，创新性地通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚定编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器组合

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要细粒度视觉理解的基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线模型

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，在多个真实基准测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值和难以从未标注真实数据学习的挑战，现有方法存在域差距或违反光度假设的问题

Method: 提出Selecting-Tuning-Maintaining (STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重，自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向进行初始化，并施加主方向正则化

Result: 在四个真实恶劣天气基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用合成恶劣数据训练的方法，甚至超过了深度基础模型

Conclusion: STM策略能够在保持预训练模型泛化能力的同时实现灵活的任务适应，为恶劣天气下的深度估计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文挑战了视觉语言模型中批评模型只用于评估而不用于生成的惯例，通过将偏好标签数据集重组为可验证训练信号，在基础生成模型上直接进行强化学习，产生了既能优化偏好判断又保持完整生成能力的统一模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视觉语言建模中，批评模型只用于评估输出（分配标量分数或成对偏好），而策略模型负责生成响应。这种分离导致批评模型很少被考虑直接用于策略用途，限制了模型的统一性和效率。

Method: 将偏好标记的批评数据集重组为可验证的训练信号，在基础生成模型上直接进行强化学习，训练出既能进行偏好判断又能保持生成能力的多模态批评模型LLaVA-Critic-R1。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1不仅成为顶级批评模型，还作为竞争性策略模型，在26个视觉推理和理解基准测试中匹配或超越专门训练的推理VLM，平均比基础模型提升5.7%。扩展方法到现有强推理VLM产生LLaVA-Critic-R1+，在7B规模上实现MMMU 71.9的SOTA性能。测试时应用自我批评可在五个代表性推理任务上平均提升13.8%。

Conclusion: 在批评数据上进行RL训练可以产生在评估和生成方面都表现出色的统一模型，为可扩展、自我改进的多模态系统提供了一条简单路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以建模长距离空间-光谱特征依赖关系。Mamba虽然解决了计算复杂度问题，但无法直接进行特征融合。

Method: 设计预处理模块适配Mamba结构，结合CNN提取多层特征；创新设计基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块，充分融合两种模态特征；结合Mamba和CNN优势构建更强主干网络。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在降低网络训练负担的前提下，超越了Transformer的实验结果。

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络成功利用了Mamba的低计算负担优势，探索了多模态特征融合的内部结构潜力，实现了更强的全图像理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Conclusion: CascadeFormer证明了Transformer架构和掩码预训练在骨架动作识别中的有效性，为相关研究提供了新的技术路径，并开源代码和模型检查点以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管投影层在视觉语言模型中至关重要，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未得到系统评估，需要建立专门的评估框架。

Method: 将目标检测数据集转换为提示格式，设计标签不相交的训练/测试分割，通过机制解释分析投影层的工作机制。

Result: 投影层在未见类别上保持79-88%的相对性能，前馈网络类似键值记忆机制，以相似方式处理已见和未见标记。

Conclusion: 研究提出了新的对齐泛化评估框架，表明投影层具有非平凡的泛化能力，为有限对齐数据下的高效VLM训练提供了潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，揭示了视觉SAE特征的真实因果驱动因素，而非仅依赖激活位置，避免了误解释风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过检查特征激活最高的图像块来理解稀疏自编码器特征，但由于自注意力机制混合了整个图像信息，激活块往往只是与特征触发共现而非因果关系，这可能导致误解释。

Method: 提出Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)，将每个SAE特征激活视为目标，应用输入归因方法来识别因果驱动该激活的图像块。

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF映射经常与朴素激活映射不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系；块插入测试证实CaFE比激活排序块更有效地恢复或抑制特征激活。

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的视觉SAE特征解释，强调了仅依赖激活位置进行解释的风险，为理解视觉Transformer特征提供了更可靠的因果分析方法。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的方法能有效处理复杂的现实世界图像理解任务

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined

efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

Motivation: 检测变换器在人类-物体交互检测中取得了显著进展，但研究发现存在"毒性兄弟"偏差问题，即大量相似但不同的HOI三元组在交互解码器的输入和输出端相互干扰和竞争，阻碍了学习效果

Method: 提出两种去偏学习目标：1）"对比后校准"-采样类似兄弟的错误HOI三元组并在强位置先验指导下重构为正确三元组；2）"合并后拆分"-先学习兄弟类别间的共享特征以与其他组区分，再显式细化组内差异以保持独特性

Result: 实验显示在HICO-Det数据集上显著超越基线（+9.18% mAP）和最先进方法（+3.59% mAP），在各种设置下均表现优异

Conclusion: 提出的两种去偏学习目标有效解决了"毒性兄弟"偏差问题，显著提升了人类-物体交互检测的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Method: 采用两阶段层次框架：(1)高速可取消产品量化索引模块进行快速候选过滤；(2)精细的加密空间检索模块进行最终精确排名。设计了专门的保护机制确保索引模块安全性和效率。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在效果、效率和安全性之间取得了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: 可取消产品量化框架为安全面部表征检索提供了高效的解决方案，有效解决了隐私保护和计算效率之间的矛盾。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

Conclusion: 提出的交叉注意力DDPM框架成功解决了脑信号生成的生物合理性问题，为视觉假体的脑编码阶段提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽视了真实驾驶场景中至关重要的时间维度，这限制了自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的表现。

Method: 提出了OmniReason框架，包含两个核心创新：1) OmniReason-Data数据集，通过幻觉缓解的自动标注管道生成具有密集时空标注和自然语言解释的大规模VLA数据集；2) OmniReason-Agent架构，集成稀疏时间记忆模块进行持久场景上下文建模，以及解释生成器产生人类可理解的决策理由。

Result: 在综合实验中表现出最先进的性能，OmniReason-Agent在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中均取得显著改进，同时为复杂动态环境中的可解释、时间感知自动驾驶车辆建立了新能力。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了自动驾驶中时空推理的关键挑战，通过创新的数据集生成方法和架构设计，为构建更可靠、可解释的自动驾驶系统提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG是一个多模态迭代检索增强生成框架，通过迭代检索和推理来提升知识密集型视觉问答的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在需要外部知识的视觉问答任务上表现有限，传统单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，每轮迭代利用累积推理记录动态生成多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并将新知识整合到推理记录中

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等基准测试中显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确率

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答中的组合推理提供了一种可扩展的方法

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的候选方案，通过语义引导显著提升了水下3D重建的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿超声标准面分类面临组织对比度低、边界模糊和操作者依赖性图像质量变化等挑战。传统的随机预处理方法无法有效处理这些问题，需要一种更符合临床工作流程的自适应方法来提高图像分析的稳健性。

Method: 提出插入式自适应对比度调节模块(ACAM)：1) 使用浅层纹理敏感网络预测临床可行的对比度参数 2) 通过可微分映射将输入图像转换为多重对比度增强视图 3) 在下游分类器中融合这些多重视图

Result: 在包含12,400张图像的多中心数据集上（涉及6个解剖类别），ACAM模块在各种模型上均显著提升了性能：轻量级模型准确率提升2.02%，传统模型提升1.29%，最先进模型提升1.15%。模块显著提高了对异质性图像的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的ACAM模块通过内容自适应能力，用物理信息变换替代随机预处理，更符合超声医师的临床工作流程。该方法有效地将低级图像特征与高级语义相结合，为实际应用中图像质量变化的医学图像分析建立了新的范式。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

Method: 提出序列差异最大化(SDM)方法，建立"循环-阶段-步骤"三层优化框架，使用负真实标签概率和定向概率差异比率(DPDR)损失函数逐步压缩解空间

Result: 实验表明SDM相比之前SOTA方法具有更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益，并能与对抗训练方法结合提升防御效果

Conclusion: SDM是一种有效的梯度基攻击方法，通过重构优化目标和创新的损失函数设计，在对抗攻击领域取得了显著改进

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合U-Net的局部特征学习和ViT的全局处理能力，配合Gabor滤波后处理，显著提升了纹理表面缺陷检测的性能，在噪声环境下表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

Motivation: 现有方法通常采用两步流程（先估计相机位姿再优化3D高斯），但运动模糊会破坏位姿估计，导致误差累积和重建质量下降。

Method: 将相机和物体运动重新表述为3D高斯的每个基元的SE(3)仿射变换，提出统一优化目标，并采用三阶段训练策略交替优化相机位姿和高斯参数。

Conclusion: 该统一优化框架通过端到端联合优化相机位姿和3D高斯属性，有效解决了运动模糊带来的重建挑战，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in

TL;DR: 提出了一种将单视图新视角合成分解为360度场景外推和视角插值的两阶段方法，通过全景扩散模型和视频扩散模型生成全局一致的新视角


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单图像新视角合成方法在长距离或循环轨迹中难以保持视图一致性和正确对齐，特别是在输入视角显著偏离的情况下

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用全景扩散模型从输入图像学习场景先验并生成360度全景；2) 从全景中采样关键帧，通过预训练视频扩散模型进行空间噪声扩散来生成新视角

Result: 在多样化场景数据集上的实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成连贯视图方面优于现有方法，即使在循环闭合场景中也能保持全局一致性

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解策略和空间噪声扩散过程，成功解决了单视图新视角合成中的长期一致性问题，同时支持灵活的相机控制

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FQAT方法，通过层冻结机制和自适应算法解决量化感知训练中的OOD泛化性能下降问题，在I.D和OOD任务上都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前QAT方法主要关注I.D数据性能，忽视了OOD数据的性能下降问题。实验证明QAT会导致显著的OOD泛化性能退化，这与损失景观平坦度理论相矛盾。

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）层冻结机制缓解双优化目标梯度冲突；2）无序引导的自适应冻结算法动态确定冻结层；3）设计梯度无序度量识别训练中的不稳定层。

Result: 在权威OOD基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法在I.D和OOD图像分类任务中都优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: FQAT通过关注损失景观平坦度，成功解决了QAT中的OOD泛化问题，为可泛化的量化感知训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集和双表征框架(DRF)，通过结合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量，解决了基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查中的数据稀缺和噪声敏感问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI脊柱侧弯筛查方法主要依赖轮廓数据集，忽略了临床相关的姿态不对称性；而基于姿态的方法由于数据稀缺和原始坐标的离散噪声特性而未被充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含447,900帧2D关键点的Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集；提出了双表征框架(DRF)，整合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量(PAV)；设计了PAV引导注意力模块(PGA)来指导特征提取。

Result: DRF实现了最先进的性能，可视化证实模型能够利用临床不对称线索指导特征提取，促进双表征之间的协同作用。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查的挑战，数据集和代码已公开，有助于推动该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://zhouzi180.github.io/Scoliosis1K/.

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级的token选择框架，通过评估视觉token的激活值并保留高分token来提升提示调优的准确性和效率，在11个few-shot基准测试中显著优于CLIP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功证明了提示调优可以实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关的特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本，需要一种更高效的token选择方法。

Method: 提出Spotlighter框架，从样本级和语义级两个角度评估每个视觉token的激活值，只保留得分最高的token进行下游预测；使用类别特定的语义记忆库来精化选择，并引入两级排序机制动态加权token-原型交互。

Result: 在11个few-shot基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升高达11.19%，额外获得0.8K FPS，仅增加21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是提示调优中有效且可扩展的基线方法，在提升准确性的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗补丁对AI模型鲁棒性构成重大挑战，特别是在目标检测等计算机视觉任务中，需要更高效的生成方法

Method: 增量补丁生成(IPG)方法，通过实验和消融研究验证，包括YOLO特征分布可视化和对抗训练结果

Result: IPG生成泛化性好的补丁，能有效覆盖更广泛的模型漏洞，生成的数据集可作为构建鲁棒模型的知识基础

Conclusion: IPG在对抗补丁防御和自动驾驶、安全系统、医疗成像等实际应用中具有巨大潜力

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

Motivation: 解决低光RAW视频由于高传感器增益和短曝光时间导致的严重信号退化问题，满足视频帧率要求下的去噪需求

Method: 提出条件化方案利用捕获元数据指导视频对齐和去噪过程，以及Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS)机制建模长程时序依赖

Result: 在严谨真实基准数据集上达到最先进性能，获得AIM 2025挑战赛第一名

Conclusion: DarkVRAI通过条件化元数据引导和BOSS时序建模的协同组合，为低光视频去噪设立了新标准

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangDC是一种语言感知的动态令牌压缩器，通过轻量级语言模型生成视频片段的软描述令牌，根据语义密度动态调整压缩比例，在减少49%计算量的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频令牌压缩方法使用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异性，导致信息丰富片段表示不足而静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 利用轻量级语言模型将视频片段转换为软描述令牌作为视觉表示，通过语义密度感知监督训练，动态调整压缩比例基于场景丰富度（描述长度）。

Result: 实验结果显示相比VideoGPT+减少49%的FLOPs计算量，同时保持竞争力性能，定性结果证明能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC模仿人类动态表达视觉信息的方式，复杂场景用更多语言描述，简单场景用较少词汇，实现了高效且自适应的视频令牌压缩。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索了如何将RGB和多光谱图像整合到3D高斯泼溅框架中，提出了三种优化策略，发现联合优化方法能有效提升多光谱重建质量并增强RGB结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然3DGS在RGB数据上表现优异，但对额外光谱的简单逐带优化会导致重建质量下降，因为光谱域中几何结构出现不一致，尽管实际几何是相同的。

Method: 评估了三种策略：1) 无共享结构的单独逐带重建；2) 分割优化（先优化RGB几何，复制后拟合新波段）；3) 联合优化（可选初始RGB阶段）。建议将多光谱数据直接整合到球谐颜色分量中。

Result: 专用优化的联合策略通过定量指标和定性新视角渲染展示出有效性，提高了整体光谱重建质量，并通过光谱串扰增强了RGB结果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在优化过程中何时以及如何引入光谱波段的关键权衡，为稳健的多模态3DGS重建提供了实用见解，建议直接整合多光谱数据到球谐颜色分量中。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Motivation: 雨天显著增加道路事故风险，了解驾驶员在恶劣天气下的视觉行为调整对于设计鲁棒的驾驶员监控系统(DMS)和高级驾驶辅助系统(ADAS)至关重要。

Method: 采用两步聚类方法分析眼动数据：先在10秒间隔内聚类注视点，然后将聚类中心聚合成元聚类，结合马尔可夫转移矩阵、注视持续时间、视线仰角和方位角分布等指标。

Result: 雨天条件下驾驶员表现出更频繁的仪表盘扫视、更长的注视持续时间、更高的视线仰角，表明认知专注度增加，但整体注视道路和偶尔检查后视镜的模式保持一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了恶劣天气下视觉注意模式的变化，强调了利用眼动建模辅助设计更鲁棒的ADAS和DMS系统的潜力。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Conclusion: CompSlider通过解耦多属性控制和引入结构一致性约束，有效解决了基于滑块的文本到图像生成中多属性相互干扰的问题，为精确的多属性控制提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理现实世界中各种玻璃污染物，通过测试时自适应机制实现了对未知污染类型的良好泛化能力

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Conclusion: LPFM作为首个统一的低级别病理学基础模型，成功解决了病理图像增强的多样化挑战，为计算病理学提供了强大的图像处理工具。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Conclusion: SpectMamba成功将Mamba架构应用于医学图像检测，通过频率-空间特征融合和优化扫描策略，在效率和准确性方面都表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了双向稀疏注意力(BSA)框架来解决视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高分辨率长视频时的计算瓶颈问题，通过动态稀疏化查询和键值对来显著提升训练和推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高质量视频时面临二次复杂度注意力机制带来的巨大计算成本，需要解决查询和键值对冗余计算的问题

Method: BSA框架包含两个关键组件：通过语义相似性和动态时空训练策略选择最具信息量的查询令牌，以及通过统计动态阈值保留最显著的KV块进行计算

Result: BSA在长序列训练中显著加速DiT，减少FLOPs达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，同时保持甚至超越全注意力的生成质量

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频DiT模型的计算效率问题，为高质量长视频生成提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEPE是一个端到端的视频姿态估计框架，通过时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，解决了传统两阶段方法效率低和时空上下文分离的问题，在Posetrack数据集上性能优越且推理效率提升300%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频姿态估计方法采用两阶段流程（检测+时序建模），存在时空维度分离、无法端到端优化、依赖复杂后处理（RoI裁剪、NMS）导致推理效率低的问题。

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个核心时空Transformer组件：STPE（时空姿态编码器）、STDME（时空可变形记忆编码器）、STPD（时空姿态解码器），并引入实例一致性机制来增强跨帧实例查询的一致性和差异性，实现实例跟踪功能。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于大多数两阶段模型，推理效率提升300%。

Conclusion: VEPE提供了一个简单灵活的端到端视频姿态估计解决方案，有效利用时序上下文优化人体姿态估计，同时显著提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Motivation: 现有点云压缩方法通常顺序处理全局和局部信息，缺乏这两种信息之间的有效通信，导致重建质量受限。

Method: 提出点体素交错网络(PVINet)，包含体素编码器提取全局结构特征和点编码器建模局部上下文，引入条件稀疏卷积实现特征交互，解码时使用点嵌入指导点云重建。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，PVINet相比最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理和特征交互有效提升了点云压缩的重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Wenzhuang Wang,Yifan Zhao,Mingcan Ma,Ming Liu,Zhonglin Jiang,Yong Chen,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FICGen方法，通过频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式，解决退化场景下布局到图像生成中的上下文幻觉困境，显著提升了生成保真度和布局对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的布局到图像生成方法在退化场景（如低光照、水下）中存在生成保真度有限和与用户提供布局对齐性弱的问题，主要原因是退化条件下的"上下文幻觉困境"，即前景实例被上下文主导的频率分布所淹没。

Method: 提出频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式(FICGen)：1) 使用可学习的双查询机制和频率重采样器从训练集中提取上下文频率原型；2) 采用视觉频率增强注意力将频率原型注入退化生成过程；3) 开发实例一致性图来调节实例与周围环境的潜在空间解耦；4) 使用自适应空间频率聚合模块重建空间频率混合的退化表示。

Result: 在5个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FICGen在各种退化场景（从严重低光照到轻度模糊）中，在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面持续超越现有的L2I方法。

Conclusion: FICGen通过将退化图像的频率知识转移到潜在扩散空间，有效解决了退化场景下的上下文幻觉问题，为布局到图像生成在挑战性环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种基于高斯参数化的空间自适应图像标记化框架，使用2D高斯分布动态建模不同图像区域的形状、位置和纹理特征，实现非均匀图像分割和高效特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，无法灵活表示不同形状、纹理和位置的图像区域，限制了特征表示的效果。

Method: 采用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均匀的可变大小区域，每个区域用2D高斯参数化（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征表示，通过专用transformer优化高斯参数，使用可微分渲染器重建特征图。

Result: 在图像重建和生成任务中，使用128个token实现了rFID 0.65和FID 1.50的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过解耦空间布局和纹理特征，实现了高效的两阶段生成，在图像表示和生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSSL是一个通用的半监督学习框架，通过空间异质性损失函数为不同像素分配不同权重，利用参考预测和监督预测之间的不确定性和一致性信息，显著提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，但忽视了标注数据中的潜在噪声以及不同未标注像素的异质性价值。作者认为有效挖掘两个预测中的丰富信息比特定参考预测策略更重要。

Method: 提出基于空间异质性损失的通用框架MetaSSL，将未标注数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），使用自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测，并为不同区域分配递减的权重。该损失也应用于标注图像以实现鲁棒学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，当与现有SSL框架集成时，MetaSSL在不同数据集上显著提高了分割性能。

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一个即插即用的通用框架，能够有效挖掘预测中的丰富信息，处理标注噪声和像素异质性，显著提升半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Result: 实验证明各组件有效性，性能超越之前最先进方法

Conclusion: 利用多时间戳轨迹信息能显著提升多视角行人跟踪的关联鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型依赖视觉语言编码器进行关键帧采样，但这些编码器是否能真正识别最具信息量的帧尚不清楚，需要实证研究。

Method: 通过实证分析，提供了多个证据揭示流行视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面的局限性。

Result: 发现当前视觉编码器在识别MLLM应该关注哪些视频帧来处理给定文本查询方面能力有限。

Conclusion: 开发更好的关键帧识别技术对于高效视频多模态大语言模型可能是必要的。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的挑战，包括EEG空间分辨率低、神经记录与视频动态的时间不匹配、以及脑活动中语义信息利用不足等问题

Method: 使用三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列确保时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)将时间感知蓝图转换为高保真视频

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上达到新的SOTA水平，视频和帧级重建精度分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%

Conclusion: DynaMind在神经动力学和高保真视觉语义之间架起了桥梁，实现了关键的技术进步

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了鲁棒且可迁移的解决方案，在遥感图像分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best

### [107] [DcMatch: Unsupervised Multi-Shape Matching with Dual-Level Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01204)
*Tianwei Ye,Yong Ma,Xiaoguang Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DcMatch是一个无监督学习框架，通过形状图注意力网络和多域一致性损失，在非刚性多形状匹配中实现了更好的点对点对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法仅从单个形状学习规范嵌入的局限性，需要捕捉整个形状集合的底层流形结构以获得更一致的多形状对应关系。

Method: 使用形状图注意力网络构建共享潜在空间，通过宇宙预测器建立形状到宇宙的对应，同时在空间和频谱域中表示对应关系，并应用新型循环一致性损失。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，该方法始终优于先前的最先进方法，在各种多形状匹配场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: DcMatch通过利用整个形状集合的结构信息和双重一致性约束，为非刚性多形状匹配提供了更准确和一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Method: 提出无参考评估指标来衡量开放词汇能力，以及通过区域特定提示调优视觉语言模型来快速生成高质量合成数据

Result: 实验结果表明，使用这种新数据分割进行预训练可以有益于开放词汇SGG模型的泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法为开放词汇场景图生成提供了更公平的评估标准和更高质量的训练数据解决方案

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRINTER是一个弱监督框架，通过原型驱动的内容-染色模式解耦和变形感知对抗学习，解决H&E和IHC连续切片的空间错位问题，实现准确的虚拟染色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前肿瘤空间异质性分析方法在连续切片中存在空间错位问题，严重影响病理学原位解释的准确性，需要更精确的虚拟染色模式。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）原型驱动的染色模式转移与显式内容-风格解耦；2）循环注册-合成框架GapBridge通过可变形结构对齐桥接H&E和IHC域；3）变形感知对抗学习框架，生成器和变形感知注册网络联合对抗优化风格聚焦判别器。

Result: 大量实验证明PRINTER在保持H&E染色细节和虚拟染色保真度方面表现出色，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为虚拟染色提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算病理学领域的发展。

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Result: POINTS-Reader模型在文档提取任务上超越了许多同等或更大规模的公开和商业模型

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不依赖手动标注或温和粉研的情况下，自动构建高质量文档提取数据集和高性能模型

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Conclusion: FantasyHSI通过多智能体协作和闭环反馈机制，成功解决了HSI中的长时程任务处理和泛化问题，为无需配对数据的真实人类行为生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how
its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the
architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed
illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components
such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is
to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of
tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide
researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Conclusion: 交叉重建显著增加了预训练难度，使该方法在3D自监督学习方面超越了之前的单模态自重建方法

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Conclusion: ReCap有效桥接了视觉感知与现实世界知识，为高风险领域中的上下文感知图像理解提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个端到端框架，联合处理LiDAR超分辨率和语义分割，通过轻量级架构和新的损失函数，在16通道低成本LiDAR上达到接近64通道高成本LiDAR的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率LiDAR成本昂贵限制了大规模部署，而低成本16通道LiDAR产生的稀疏点云会降低分割精度，需要一种既能提升分辨率又能保持分割性能的解决方案。

Method: 采用端到端联合优化框架，SR模块融入语义线索并保留细节；设计新的SR损失函数关注感兴趣区域；使用轻量级模型基础架构，参数少且易与分割网络兼容。

Result: 实验表明该方法在分割性能上可与使用昂贵64通道LiDAR数据的模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架有效解决了低成本LiDAR分辨率不足的问题，实现了高性能的3D语义分割，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Motivation: 医学图像分割存在模糊性，需要模型捕捉完整的条件分布而非单点估计，现有方法在校准性和采样效率方面存在不足

Method: 将离散标签嵌入连续空间对齐分割与扩散建模；使用粗粒度先验预测器提供逐步指导；扩散网络学习先验残差加速收敛；采用深度扩散监督方案稳定训练

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，PGRD相比贝叶斯、集成、Probabilistic U-Net和普通扩散基线，获得了更高的Dice分数和更低的NLL/ECE值，且需要更少采样步骤

Conclusion: PGRD框架能够有效学习医学图像分割的体素级分布，在保持强校准性的同时实现实用的采样效率，优于现有概率分割方法

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体数据和智能手机摄像头的普及，使用传统计算机视觉技术进行图像定位变得越来越具挑战性，但同时也更加重要。需要一种新的方法来应对这些挑战并提高定位准确性。

Method: 方法采用开源多模态大语言模型结合检索增强生成技术。使用SigLIP编码器在两个大规模数据集（EMP-16和OSV-5M）上构建向量数据库。查询图像通过从数据库中检索到的相似和不相似地理位置信息进行提示增强，然后由多模态大语言模型处理。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了基于检索增强生成的多模态大语言模型在地理定位估计中的有效性，为传统从头开始训练模型的方法提供了一条替代路径，为GeoAI领域开启了更可访问和可扩展解决方案的新可能性。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3Ret是一个统一的医学图像检索模型，通过自监督学习在混合模态数据集上训练，无需模态特定定制，在零样本检索和跨模态对齐方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法针对不同模态使用分离的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定的设计限制了可扩展性，阻碍了统一表示的发展。

Method: 构建包含867,653个医学图像样本的大规模混合模态数据集，使用生成式(MAE)和对比式(SimDINO)自监督学习范式训练统一的视觉编码器M3Ret，无需任何模态特定定制。

Result: 在所有单个模态的零样本图像检索中达到新的最先进水平，超越了DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等强基线。在没有配对数据的情况下实现了强大的跨模态对齐，并且能够泛化到未见过的MRI任务。

Conclusion: M3Ret为医学成像社区提供了一个有前景的信号，是迈向多模态医学图像理解视觉自监督基础模型的重要一步，证明了纯视觉自监督对未见模态的泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Conclusion: TPIGE框架通过无需训练的方式，有效解决了识别保持文本到视频生成中的语义间隔问题，以最小的成本实现了显著的性能提升，为该领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究证明了将摄像头运动特性纳入系统设计对于可转向摄像头实时视频分析的重要性，Uirapuru框架有效解决了动态场景下的分析挑战。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform

three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust

Motivation: PRVR任务面临查询歧义和部分视频相关性带来的数据不确定性挑战，现有方法容易受到具有虚假相似性的干扰视频影响

Method: 提出RAL框架：1）将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模；2）引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度

Result: 在多种检索骨干网络上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: RAL作为一个即插即用的解决方案，能够有效建模数据不确定性，提升PRVR任务的性能

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: RibPull是一种利用隐式占用场连接计算几何和医学成像的方法，通过神经占用场表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取中轴，相比体素方法能更好地处理稀疏数据和几何操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体素网格在医学成像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，而隐式3D表示能更有效地处理稀疏和噪声数据，保留复杂几何信息。

Method: 使用神经占用场预测3D点是否在物体内部来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取胸腔的中轴。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，证明了连续坐标基3D场景表示相比体素基表示的优越性。

Conclusion: 隐式占用场方法为医学成像中的几何操作提供了更好的解决方案，能够有效处理稀疏数据并保留几何信息。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法主要关注语义控制，但忽视了风格一致性的重要性，这影响了图像的连贯性和美观性。

Method: 采用先进扩散模型，包含两个并行交叉注意力机制分别处理文本和风格信息；提出PSRL模块通过风格对比损失学习细粒度风格表示；建立综合基准测试体系。

Result: 在建立的综合基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: NSD框架成功解决了图像编辑中的风格一致性问题，为语义控制和风格保持提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Conclusion: InfoScale通过信息中心化方法有效解决了扩散模型在变尺度图像生成中的三个关键问题，实现了更好的跨分辨率生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

Conclusion: PointSlice通过创新的点云切片处理和SIN网络，成功实现了高检测精度和快速推理的平衡，为自动驾驶中的3D目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Conclusion: ConTiCoM-3D为可扩展的3D形状生成建立了一个实用框架，实现了快速生成和高几何保真度。

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Conclusion: MSA2-Net通过自适应的架构设计，在多种医学图像分割任务中展现出强大的鲁棒性和精确性，证明了该方法在提升模型泛化能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Motivation: HIFU治疗的成功和安全性依赖于实时监测，但使用超声引导HIFU治疗时经常受到干扰的影响，这阻碍了有效的实时监控。

Method: 采用Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)将含噪超声图像编码到低维潜在空间，然后使用潜在扩散模型迭代去除干扰，最后解码重建高分辨率无干扰超声图像。

Result: HIFU-ILDiff在体外实验中达到SSIM 0.796和PSNR 23.780，显著优于陷波滤波器的SSIM 0.443和PSNR 14.420，并能以15帧/秒的速度实时处理，远快于陷波滤波器的5秒/帧。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪HIFU干扰，为HIFU治疗提供精确的实时监测，将极大提高当前临床应用的治疗精度。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

TL;DR: Keye-VL-1.5是一个创新的多模态大语言模型，通过慢快视频编码策略、渐进式预训练和综合后训练流程，显著提升了视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理视频内容时面临空间分辨率和时间覆盖之间的权衡问题，视频理解仍然是一个具有挑战性的领域。

Method: 1) 慢快视频编码策略：基于帧间相似性动态分配计算资源；2) 四阶段渐进预训练：将上下文长度从8K扩展到128K token；3) 综合后训练流程：包括思维链数据构建、GSPO强化学习和对齐训练。

Result: 在公共基准测试和严格的人工评估中，Keye-VL-1.5相比现有模型有显著改进，特别是在视频理解任务中表现出色，同时在通用多模态基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Keye-VL-1.5通过创新的编码策略、渐进训练方法和综合后训练流程，有效解决了视频理解中的关键挑战，为多模态视频分析提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

*Ganlin Zhang,Shenhan Qian,Xi Wang,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSTA-SLAM是一个无需相机内参的实时单目视觉SLAM系统，使用轻量级对称双视图关联模型作为前端，后端采用特殊设计的Sim(3)位姿图，在相机跟踪和3D重建质量方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统视觉SLAM系统需要已知相机内参参数的限制，开发一个能够广泛适用于各种相机设置的通用SLAM系统，同时降低模型复杂度并提高性能。

Method: 前端使用轻量级对称双视图关联(STA)模型，仅从两个RGB图像同时估计相对相机位姿和回归局部点图；后端构建专门的Sim(3)位姿图，包含闭环检测来处理累积漂移。

Result: 前端模型大小仅为同类最先进方法的35%，显著降低了模型复杂度；在相机跟踪和密集3D重建质量方面都实现了优于当前方法的性能。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一个无需相机内参的高效实时单目视觉SLAM解决方案，在保持轻量级设计的同时实现了卓越的性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O-DisCo-Edit是一个统一的视频编辑框架，通过新颖的对象失真控制信号(O-DisCo)和复制形式保护模块，实现了高效高质量的视频编辑，无需为不同编辑任务设计不同的控制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中面临挑战，需要为不同的编辑任务设计不同的控制信号，这导致模型设计复杂且需要大量训练资源。

Method: 提出O-DisCo-Edit框架，包含基于随机和自适应噪声的对象失真控制信号(O-DisCo)，以及用于保护未编辑区域的"复制形式"保护模块。

Result: 广泛的实验和全面的人类评估一致表明，O-DisCo-Edit在各种视频编辑任务中超越了专业化和多任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit提供了一个统一的解决方案，能够灵活封装多种编辑线索，实现高效、高保真度的视频编辑。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

### [149] [TransForSeg: A Multitask Stereo ViT for Joint Stereo Segmentation and 3D Force Estimation in Catheterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01605)
*Pedram Fekri,Mehrdad Zadeh,Javad Dargahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的立体视觉Transformer模型，通过处理双视角X光图像来同时实现引流管分割和3D力估计，在两个任务上都超越了现有的最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务深度学习模型通过CNN编码器-解码器处理双视角X光图像，但需要逐渐扩大感受野。本文从新视角出发，提出使用Vision Transformer来捐捕长程依赖关系。

Method: 提出了一种新的编码器-解码器Vision Transformer模型，将两张X光图像作为独立序列处理。通过处理双视角的X光图像块序列，Transformer能够捐捕长程依赖关系而无需逐渐扩大感受野。编码器和解码器生成的嵌入被输入到两个共享分割头，而回归头利用解码器的融合信息进行3D力估计。

Result: 模型在各种噪声水平的合成X光图像上进行了广泛实验，与最先进的纯分割模型、视觉基于引流管力估计方法以及多任务引流管分割和力估计方法进行了比较。该模型在引流管分割和力估计两个任务上都超越了现有模型，设立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 本文提出的立体视觉Transformer模型能够同时完成从两个角度分割引流管并估计其尖端在3D空间中产生的力。该方法为引流管手术提供了更准确的视觉和触觉感知数据，在两个任务上都达到了最先进性能。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

### [150] [Improving Large Vision and Language Models by Learning from a Panel of Peers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01610)
*Jefferson Hernandez,Jing Shi,Simon Jenni,Vicente Ordonez,Kushal Kafle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Panel-of-Peers学习框架，通过多个LVLM模型相互评估和学习，免除了对人工标注偏好数据的依赖，在15个测试集上平均分数从48%提升到57%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖人工精选的偏好数据，成本高；机器生成数据质量有限；自监督数据容易引入幻觉

Method: 受人类协作学习启发，构建一组LVLM模型组成的"同行委员会"，通过迭代自我改进过程，模拟同行审查系统，让模型们生成、评估和精炼输出

Result: 在15个测试集上平均分数从48%显著提升到57%，显示了同行评估作为可扩展对齐方法的潜力

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers框架能够在不需要大量人工标签数据的情况下有效提升模型性能，为LVLM对齐提供了一种可扩展的替代方案

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

### [151] [Q-Sched: Pushing the Boundaries of Few-Step Diffusion Models with Quantization-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01624)
*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确率，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高昂，即使是few-step模型也需要大型未压缩的backbone，限制了在非数据中心GPU上的部署。现有后训练量化方法依赖全精度校准，成本依然很高。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过修改扩散模型调度器来调整few-step采样轨迹；设计JAQ损失函数，结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标，实现免参考的量化感知预调节系数学习。

Result: 相比FP16 4-step LCM模型提升15.5% FID，相比FP16 8-step PCM模型提升16.6% FID；在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上的大规模用户研究（超过80,000个标注）证实了有效性。

Conclusion: 量化与few-step蒸馏在高保真生成方面具有互补性，Q-Sched为高效扩散模型部署提供了新思路，避免了全精度推理的校准需求。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

*Yanqing Liu,Xianhang Li,Letian Zhang,Zirui Wang,Zeyu Zheng,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVision 2简化了原版架构，移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式标题损失，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升OpenVision的训练效率，减少计算资源和内存消耗，同时保持多模态性能竞争力。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用生成式标题损失进行纯生成式训练，简化架构设计。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍（83h→57h），内存使用减少1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批次大小从2k增至8k，参数量可扩展至10亿以上，性能与原版相当。

Conclusion: 轻量级的纯生成式训练范式对未来多模态基础模型中视觉编码器的发展具有重要价值。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习有效提升了多模态LLM的视觉工具使用和推理能力，为RL-based视觉工具使用提供了新的见解

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Conclusion: GaussianGAN成功解决了现有方法的模糊问题，实现了实时、逼真、可控的人体化身渲染，在像素保真度方面达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

TL;DR: PCA在多标签多光谱图像分类中的效果取决于深度学习架构和训练策略，ResNet50和DINOv2架构表现不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱图像数据维度高且处理困难，多标签分类（每个图像可能属于多个类别）使特征提取更加复杂，需要研究降维方法的有效性

Method: 使用ResNet50和DINOv2进行多标签分类，在分类器前加入可选的PCA步骤将数据降维至3维，然后输入三层分类器

Result: PCA对多标签多光谱图像分类的效果强烈依赖于所选的深度学习架构和训练策略

Conclusion: 研究结果为自监督预训练和替代降维方法的未来研究开辟了道路，表明需要根据具体架构选择降维策略

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 岩石粒度精确分类对岩土工程、采矿和资源管理至关重要，影响运营效率和安全，需要更准确的分类方法

Method: 在ConvNeXt基础上构建CNSCA模型，引入自注意力机制捕获长距离空间依赖，通道注意力机制强调信息特征通道

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于临床元数据的两阶段扩散框架，用于有限角度CT重建，通过元数据引导生成先验并确保数据一致性，显著改善了重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT虽然提高了时间分辨率和降低了辐射剂量，但由于投影截断导致严重伪影，需要解决其不适定性问题

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段使用基于transformer的扩散模型仅根据元数据生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段整合粗略先验和元数据生成高保真结果，并在每个采样步骤使用ADMM模块强制执行基于物理的数据一致性

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，加入元数据显著提高了重建保真度，特别是在严重角度截断情况下。相比无元数据基线，在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上表现更优

Conclusion: 临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面具有双重作用，不同类型的元数据提供互补优势，特别是诊断和人口统计先验在有限角度条件下效果显著，支持将其整合到未来的元数据引导医学成像框架中

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect
data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images,
TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Conclusion: 该工作证实了通过挖掘基础知识可以可行地控制图像光照，实现了实用和通用的重光照功能。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

TL;DR: LGDiST是首个无参考的潜在基因扩散模型，用于解决空间转录组学数据丢失问题，在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，并能提升其他基因表达预测方法性能达10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于计算机视觉的空间转录组学分析方法受数据丢失问题限制，现有方法依赖单细胞RNA测序参考，存在对齐质量依赖、外部数据集依赖、批次效应和继承丢失等局限性。

Method: 提出LGDiST模型，使用之前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富且有生物学意义的遗传潜在空间，采用扩散模型完成基因表达，包含上下文基因、ST潜在空间和邻居条件等关键组件。

Result: 在26个数据集上平均MSE比现有最佳方法低18%，完成后的ST数据使六种最先进方法的基因表达预测性能提升高达10%的MSE。移除关键组件会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构比任何单独组件都能获得显著更好的性能，证明了使用上下文基因构建遗传潜在空间的有效性，为空间转录组学数据分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Conclusion: 这项工作为CAV中鲁棒的联邦学习部署铺平了道路，提供了全面的评估框架和方法论指导。

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Motivation: 传统野火損坏评估方法耗时过长，而现代计算机视觉方法需要大量标签数据，影响灾后部署效率。需要一种能够快速、准确评估资产損失的创新方法。

Method: 研究提出了两种零样本流水线：简单VLM流水线（A）和VLM+大语言模型流水线（B）。使用预训练的视觉语言模型，基于特定的野火損坏指标构建结构化提示，并通过多视角图像进行分析综合。

Result: 多视角分析显著提高了分类精度：单视角F1分数仅0.225-0.511，而多视角达到0.857-0.947。McNemar测试证明多视角改进具有统计显著性，但A和B流水线间差异不显著。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种即时可部署、灵活且可解释的工作流程，避免了监督学习的需求，显著加快了灾后应急响应中的分流和优先级判断。多视角分析在野火損坏评估中具有重要价值，未来可继续探索LLM提示在損坏评估中的潜力。

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Conclusion: 这是首次将可解释性引入地理定位领域的研究，通过概念瓶颈模块同时提升了模型的准确性和可解释性，为地理决策提供了更深入的语义理解

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个针对多主体个性化生成的表示中心框架，通过显式语义对应和正交特征解耦来解决身份混合和属性泄漏问题，在4+参考主体情况下仍能保持高保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多主体生成方法存在身份混合和属性泄漏问题，主要原因是缺乏对多个参考主体在共享表示空间中如何交互的充分建模

Method: 提出语义对应注意力损失来强制精确的点对点语义对齐，开发多参考解耦损失将不同主体推入正交注意力子空间以防止特征干扰，并引入SemAlign-MS数据集提供细粒度语义对应

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，现有方法通常在3个主体以上性能下降，而MOSAIC在4+参考主体情况下仍能保持高保真度

Conclusion: MOSAIC通过表示层面的精确语义对齐和正交特征解耦，为复杂多主体合成应用开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

Motivation: 虽然条件生成已被广泛研究，但无需额外训练即可实现提示引导图像编辑的能力同样重要，因为它支持众多实际应用。本文旨在探索VAR模型的文本到图像编辑能力。

Method: 引入Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN)方法，利用新颖的位置感知Argmax反演(LAI)伪逆函数生成逆Gumbel噪声，实现源图像精确重建和文本对齐的可控编辑。

Result: 大量实验表明，VARIN能有效根据指定提示修改源图像，同时显著保留原始背景和结构细节，验证了其作为实用编辑方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VARIN是首个专门为VAR模型设计的噪声反转编辑技术，通过创新的LAI方法实现了高质量的文本引导图像编辑，在保持原始图像结构的同时完成精确的语义修改。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Draw-In-Mind (DIM) 是一个新的多模态模型，通过重新分配理解模块和生成模块的职责来解决图像编辑精度问题，在较小参数规模下实现了SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型在文本到图像生成方面表现良好，但在精确图像编辑方面存在困难，主要原因是理解模块和生成模块之间的职责分配不平衡

Method: 提出了DIM数据集（包含14M图像-文本对和233K思维链想象），通过冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B连接，使用轻量级两层MLP进行训练

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性性能，超越了UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit等更大模型

Conclusion: 将设计职责明确分配给理解模块可以显著提升图像编辑性能，证明了职责重新分配的有效性

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at
https://github.com/showlab/DIM.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter是一种新颖的方法，用于在文本到图像扩散模型中基于用户指定的调色板进行条件生成，通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图并引入熵和距离控制参数来解决调色板条件生成的模糊性和不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板是创意工作流程中广泛使用的紧凑直观工具，但在用于图像生成条件时存在显著的模糊性和不稳定性，需要一种能够灵活控制调色板遵循程度和颜色变化的方法。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个标量控制参数，提出负直方图机制来抑制不需要的色调，并在精心策划的数据集上进行训练以确保颜色空间的广泛泛化。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter通过创新的调色板解释和控制机制，有效解决了调色板条件图像生成的挑战，为创意工作流程提供了更稳定和可控的图像生成工具。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言-视觉理解方面取得进展，但其可靠性和鲁棒性研究不足。本文从设计逻辑角度分析RMOT系统的安全漏洞，特别是FIFO内存机制中的时空推理漏洞。

Method: 提出VEIL对抗攻击框架，针对RMOT系统的语言-视觉引用和跟踪对象匹配组件设计攻击。利用FIFO内存的持续性漏洞，通过时空推理攻击在历史缓冲区中引入持久错误。

Result: 在Refer-KITTI数据集上的综合评估验证了VEIL的有效性，能够导致跟踪ID切换和终止，严重破坏跟踪逻辑的可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RMOT系统存在严重的安全漏洞，强调了在关键大规模应用中需要安全感知的RMOT设计，亟需提高系统的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Motivation: 传统对比自监督学习依赖大量真实数据和精心策划的困难负样本，本文探索通过"伪造"数据来替代这些需求，研究合成数据在视觉表示学习中的潜力。

Method: 采用两种"伪造"方式：1) 使用生成模型创建合成数据增强样本多样性；2) 在表示空间中生成合成困难负样本。结合这两种方法形成Syn2Co框架，在DeiT-S和Swin-T架构上进行评估。

Result: 研究结果突显了合成数据在自监督学习中的前景和局限性，为未来研究方向提供了见解。

Conclusion: 合成增强训练可以产生更鲁棒和可迁移的视觉表示，但合成数据的使用仍存在一定局限性，需要进一步探索。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的slot attention方法，通过ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch解决了现有方法缺乏高级语义信息和无法微调编码器的问题，在多个数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的slot attention方法存在两个主要问题：(1)缺乏高级语义信息，仅依赖低级特征如颜色和紋理；(2)无法微调编码器，限制了学习灵活性。

Method: 提出了ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch。ContextFusion利用前景和背景的语义信息，添加辅助指标以提供更丰富的语义内容。Bootstrap Branch将特征适应与重构阶段解耦，通过自助策略训练特征适应机制。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在模拟和真实世界数据集上都显著提升了各种SOTA slot attention模型的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的ContextFusion和Bootstrap Branch方法可以无缝集成到现有slot attention模型中，有效解决了现有方法的两大限制，提供了更灵活和有效的对象中心学习方案。

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构异常（如凹痕和划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测方面表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新设计的组合分支来显式建模对象组合图的分布，学习重要语义关系。同时引入无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组合图提取新流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上显著优于现有最先进方法，达到96.1%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组合图分布，SALAD方法在逻辑异常检测方面取得了显著改进，证明了语义感知方法的重要性。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全向场景理解中的几何畸变和复杂空间关系问题，现有方法仅关注单帧而忽略了跨帧相关全景图像的重要性。

Method: 构建CFpano数据集（2700+图像，8000+问答对），提出基于Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和多模态大语言模型(MLLM)的方法，使用定制奖励函数进行微调。

Result: 在CFpano基准测试中，该方法在多项选择和开放式VQA任务上均达到最先进性能，整体性能提升5.37%，在所有主要推理类别上超越强基线。

Conclusion: GRPO方法有效，为全景场景理解建立了新的基准，验证了跨帧相关全景图像处理的重要性。

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间关系理解方面存在明显不足，需要建立一个专门的基准来测试和评估模型在这方面的能力，特别是区分物体定位和空间推理的贡献。

Method: 创建了一个全新的真实世界图像-文本对数据集，专门设计用于测试相对空间理解和物体顺序。通过对比分析和消融实验，分离物体定位和空间推理的贡献，并使用思维链模型进行分析。

Result: 结果显示开源和前沿商业VLM在空间关系理解方面存在显著缺陷，而推理模型表现意外地好。分析发现基准性能的瓶颈在于空间推理能力而非物体定位能力。

Conclusion: RocketScience基准有效揭示了当前VLM在空间关系理解方面的局限性，强调了空间推理能力的重要性，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考。数据集以CC-BY-4.0许可证发布，评估代码开源。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Motivation: 当前的TTA测试数据集缺乏对现实世界中自然存在的时间依赖性的模拟，如视频流中连续帧之间的相关性。这个缺陷导致无法全面评估TTA方法在真实场景下的表现。

Method: 从物体跟踪数据集的边框中收集序列化的物体中心图像，构建了叫做"ITD"的新验证数据集。这个数据集自然体现了时间依赖性。对现有TTA方法进行了详细实验分析，并提出了一种新的对抗性内存初始化策略。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个更加现实的TTA测试框架，揭示了时间依赖性对模型适配的重要影响，并为改善内存基TTA方法的性能提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation

Motivation: 现有人群计数模型在处理复杂场景时面临两个主要挑战：区域间密度分布差异大，以及视角变化和姿态差异导致的个体表示不一致，限制了计数精度

Method: 设计双流图卷积网络(DSGC-Net)，包含密度近似(DA)分支和表示近似(RA)分支。DA分支构建密度驱动的语义图，RA分支构建表示驱动的语义图，分别应用图卷积网络建模潜在语义关系

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上验证，在ShanghaiTech Part A和Part B数据集上分别达到MAE 48.9和5.9，优于当前最先进方法

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过挖掘特征相关性，有效提升了模型对密度变化的适应能力和在多视角多姿态场景下的计数精度，为复杂人群计数提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

Method: 提出遥感专用视觉语言建模框架，包含空间特征增强、双提示对齐机制（交叉验证场景上下文和细粒度语义的空间语义一致性）以及置信度引导的自训练循环

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中持续优于现有方法，能够以最少标注数据实现高效适应

Conclusion: 空间语义集成在遥感OOD检测中具有关键价值，RS-OOD框架为解决遥感特定挑战提供了有效方案

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene

introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source

labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic

Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on

Conclusion: Learn-to-Steer框架通过数据驱动的目标学习有效解决了扩散模型的空间推理问题，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过模拟人脑的脑-小脑机制，成功解决了多模态数据冲突问题，为构建高性能通用智能体提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 序数图像分类中标签边界模糊，标注过程容易产生噪声，这会严重影响监督学习模型的性能和可靠性

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)建模序数标签的模糊性和不确定性，在训练过程中动态调整每个样本标签分布的均值和标准差

Result: 在Adience数据集上，40%噪声情况下ORDAC_R将平均绝对误差从0.86降至0.62，召回率从0.37提升至0.49，在原始数据集的内在噪声校正中也表现有效

Conclusion: 使用标签分布进行自适应标签校正是提高序数分类模型在噪声数据下鲁棒性和准确性的有效策略

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面的局限性，提出了MulSeT基准测试，发现仅靠增加训练数据无法有效提升空间理解能力，空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面仍存在困难，但缺乏全面系统的评估。本文旨在从数据和架构两个角度系统分析MLLMs在单视图、多视图和视频三种场景下的空间理解能力。

Method: 提出了MulSeT基准测试，设计了一系列实验来分析MLLMs的空间推理能力。从数据角度分析训练数据量对性能的影响，从架构角度分析位置编码在视觉编码器和语言模型中的作用。

Result: 发现空间理解的性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，上限相对较低，特别是需要空间想象的任务。空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码，而非语言模型中的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以实现满意的空间理解性能，需要通过架构设计来优化空间理解能力，为改进空间推理能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学CT和MRI扫描中器官和肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型缺乏跨模态和跨机构的泛化能力，基础模型在医学图像分割中表现不佳且存在领域差距

Method: 重新设计简单有效的多尺度token聚合架构，在CT-3M数据集（387万张CT切片）上进行多阶段DINOv3领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征

Result: MedDINOv3在四个分割基准测试中匹配或超越了最先进的性能，证明了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干的潜力

Conclusion: 该框架成功将自然图像基础模型适配到医学图像分割，为解决医学图像分割的泛化性问题提供了有效方案，代码已开源

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Motivation: 现有高性能实时立体匹配方法依赖3D正则化，不利于移动设备部署；而基于2D正则化的方法在病态区域表现不佳。

Method: 设计轻量级双向几何聚合块，分别捕获空间和视差表示，通过解耦学习实现4D成本体积的有效聚合。

Result: 在推理时间和准确性方面均优于所有现有基于聚合的方法，甚至超过迭代方法IGEV-Stereo。

Conclusion: 打破了使用3D卷积处理4D成本体积的经验设计，为解耦聚合范式提供了简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a
simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for
further study. Code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出GSD-Net网络，通过几何和结构双重引导机制提升医学图像分割在噪声标注下的鲁棒性，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割依赖大规模高质量标注，但专家标注存在主观性和粗糙标注等噪声问题，影响模型性能

Method: 几何距离感知模块动态调整像素级权重，结构引导标签细化模块利用结构先验优化标签，知识迁移模块增强监督和对局部细节的敏感性

Result: 在6个公开数据集上验证，在Kvasir提升2.52%、Shenzhen提升22.76%、BU-SUC提升8.87%、BraTS2020提升4.59%

Conclusion: GSD-Net能有效处理医学图像分割中的标注噪声问题，显著提升模型在噪声环境下的性能表现

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of
this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/GSD-Net.

Motivation: 红外与可见光图像融合在增强场景感知方面具有重要作用，但现有方法在保持轻量级模型的同时实现高质量融合仍面临挑战。需要一种能够让学生模型既从教师模型学习知识，又能通过自学习提升能力的创新方法。

Method: 提出协作蒸馏与自学习框架，使用强化学习智能体探索最佳训练策略。智能体以学生性能和师生差距为输入，生成挑战性样本来促进学生自学习，同时动态调整教师指导强度以优化知识迁移。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能显著提升学生模型性能，相比现有技术获得更好的融合效果，在保持模型轻量化的同时实现了更高质量的图像融合。

Conclusion: 该框架通过强化学习驱动的协作蒸馏和自学习机制，有效解决了轻量级模型高质量图像融合的挑战，为多模态图像融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分离半透明化妆与皮肤颜色时遇到困难，导致身份偏移和公平性问题，同时缺乏实时能力和时间一致性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将化妆转移解耦为两个步骤：透明化妆面具提取和基于图形学的面具渲染。使用伪真实数据训练提取模型，通过图形渲染流水线和无监督k-means聚类方法生成数据。提出专门的训练目标，包括alpha权重重建和唇彩颜色损失。

Conclusion: 该框架通过划时解耦化妆提取和渲染步骤，结合专门的训练目标，成功解决了实时虚拟化妆试用中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Motivation: 现有低分辨率卫星数据难以准确监测狭窄或富含沉积物的河流，限制了精细尺度的地表水动态监测能力。

Method: 开发包含1145张高分辨率图像的数据集，进行100多小时人工标注，与Sentinel-2、SWOT和SWORD数据库配准，评估多种深度学习架构和预训练策略。

Conclusion: RiverScope为精细尺度和多传感器水文建模提供了宝贵资源，支持气候适应和可持续水资源管理。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了交互式的生成式视频合成，允许用户自定义动态元素的大小、运动轨迹等属性，为视频创作提供了新的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Conclusion: TeRA框架为文本到3D虚拟人生成提供了更高效有效的解决方案，通过结构化潜在表示和潜在扩散模型实现了更好的生成质量和定制能力

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，用于解决医学影像中现有位置编码方法在处理各向异性高维图像时的局限性，在多个医学影像任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中复杂的器官形状和各向异性的高维图像特性使得传统位置编码方法(如正弦位置编码和各向同性傅里叶特征编码)表现不佳，需要专门针对医学影像特点设计的位置编码方法。

Method: 提出了各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，这是对各向同性傅里叶特征编码的泛化，能够整合各向异性、类别特定和领域特定的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在胸部X光多标签分类、CT器官分类和超声心动图射血分数回归等任务中，AFPE在所有测试的各向异性设置中都显著优于最先进的位置编码方法，模型性能得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 在各向异性的医学图像和视频中，选择适合数据和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要，AFPE为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Conclusion: 该方法能够稳定自适应地聚合分布式客户端的异构数据和模态，有效解决混合模态联邦学习中的挑战。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

TL;DR: 提出了FastVGGT方法，通过训练无关的token合并机制加速3D视觉几何模型VGGT，在保持重建能力的同时实现4倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D视觉基础模型在处理长序列图像输入时存在推理效率低下的问题，VGGT模型存在token崩溃现象和计算冗余

Method: 针对3D架构和任务设计独特的token划分策略，首次在3D领域应用token合并技术，通过训练无关的机制消除冗余计算

Result: 在多个3D几何基准测试中验证有效性，1000张输入图像时比VGGT快4倍，同时减轻长序列场景中的误差累积

Conclusion: token合并是构建可扩展3D视觉系统的有前景的解决方案，FastVGGT展示了在保持性能的同时显著提升效率的潜力

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

### [214] [Bias Mitigation for AI-Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems: A Systematic Literature Review and Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00109)
*Theodor Stoecker,Samed Bayer,Ingo Weber*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇系统性文献综述分析了推荐系统中的AI反馈循环偏见问题，综合评估了24项在多轮重训中验证的偏见缓解方法，并提供了可重用分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统通过不断重训用户反馈形成AI反馈循环，这会放大偏见并降低公平性，但现有偏见缓解技术多在静态数据上测试，缺乏长期公平性验证。

Method: 通过系统性文献综述方法，屏选347篇论文，最终选取24项主要研究，并按六个维度进行编码分析：缓解技术、偏见类型、动态测试设置、评估重点、应用领域和机器学习任务。

Result: 研究发现该领域存在重要空白：缺乏共享模拟器、评估指标不统一、大都分研究只报告公平性或性能之一（仅6项同时考虑两者）。

Conclusion: 该分类法为业界实践者提供了选择稳健方法的快速检查表，为研究人员提供了领域空白的清晰路线图，并强调了建立标准化模拟器和统一评估标准的必要性。

Abstract: Recommender systems continually retrain on user reactions to their own
predictions, creating AI feedback loops that amplify biases and diminish
fairness over time. Despite this well-known risk, most bias mitigation
techniques are tested only on static splits, so their long-term fairness across
multiple retraining rounds remains unclear. We therefore present a systematic
literature review of bias mitigation methods that explicitly consider AI
feedback loops and are validated in multi-round simulations or live A/B tests.
Screening 347 papers yields 24 primary studies published between 2019-2025.
Each study is coded on six dimensions: mitigation technique, biases addressed,
dynamic testing set-up, evaluation focus, application domain, and ML task,
organising them into a reusable taxonomy. The taxonomy offers industry
practitioners a quick checklist for selecting robust methods and gives
researchers a clear roadmap to the field's most urgent gaps. Examples include
the shortage of shared simulators, varying evaluation metrics, and the fact
that most studies report either fairness or performance; only six use both.

*Chen Zheng,Zhenyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文探讨推荐系统A/B测试中的算法适应偏差问题，指出生产模型、用户数据和训练管道之间的飞轮效应会导致实验结果失真，低估新变体的真实性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线实验是评估推荐系统变体的黄金标准，但算法适应偏差会扭曲实验结果，误导决策。这种偏差源于生产模型、用户数据和训练管道之间的动态相互作用，导致在受限实验环境中测量的效果与全量部署时的真实影响存在显著差异。

Method: 详细分析算法适应偏差的机制，通过真实世界实验提供实证证据，并讨论涵盖实验设计、测量和调整的解决方案。

Result: 实验结果表明，算法适应偏差往往偏向拥有大流量的生产变体，而低估小流量测试变体的性能，导致错过真正优胜变体的上线机会或低估其影响。

Conclusion: 需要提高对算法适应偏差的认识，将其置于推荐系统评估偏差的更广泛背景下，并推动讨论涵盖实验设计、测量和调整的解决方案，以实现更稳健的在线评估。

Abstract: Online experiments (A/B tests) are widely regarded as the gold standard for
evaluating recommender system variants and guiding launch decisions. However, a
variety of biases can distort the results of the experiment and mislead
decision-making. An underexplored but critical bias is algorithm adaptation
effect. This bias arises from the flywheel dynamics among production models,
user data, and training pipelines: new models are evaluated on user data whose
distributions are shaped by the incumbent system or tested only in a small
treatment group. As a result, the measured effect of a new product change in
modeling and user experience in this constrained experimental setting can
diverge substantially from its true impact in full deployment. In practice, the
experiment results often favor the production variant with large traffic while
underestimating the performance of the test variant with small traffic, which
leads to missing opportunities to launch a true winning arm or underestimating
the impact. This paper aims to raise awareness of algorithm adaptation bias,
situate it within the broader landscape of RecSys evaluation biases, and
motivate discussion of solutions that span experiment design, measurement, and
adjustment. We detail the mechanisms of this bias, present empirical evidence
from real-world experiments, and discuss potential methods for a more robust
online evaluation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DPG-Diff是一个新颖的扩散模型，通过解耦领域不变和领域特定偏好来解决跨域序列推荐中的负迁移和噪声问题，显著提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐中，简单的序列信号聚合会导致领域特定偏好冲突和负迁移问题，同时噪声行为（如误点击）在领域异质性下被进一步放大，需要解耦三个交织的信号：领域不变偏好、领域特定偏好和噪声。

Method: 提出DPG-Diff模型，将用户偏好解耦为领域不变和领域特定组件，共同指导反向扩散过程，实现稳健的跨域知识迁移和噪声过滤。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，DPG-Diff在多个指标上 consistently 优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DPG-Diff是第一个专门为跨域序列推荐设计的扩散模型，通过解耦偏好指导机制有效解决了负迁移和噪声问题，显著提升了推荐质量。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across
domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of
sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences,
leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already
suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR
further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse
item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three
intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences,
and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework
well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness
to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making
them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing
applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often
conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain
collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability
to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose
\textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the
first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge.
DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This
disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates
negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ERank是一个基于推理大语言模型的高效点式重排序器，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）解决了现有方法在评分区分度和推理效率之间的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM重排序器面临基本权衡：监督微调的点式方法缺乏评分区分度，而复杂的列表式方法效率低下，不适合低延迟应用

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1）监督微调阶段训练模型输出细粒度整数分数；2）强化学习阶段使用新颖的列表式奖励来注入全局排序意识

Result: 在BRIGHT、FollowIR、TREC DL和BEIR基准测试中表现出卓越的有效性和鲁棒性。在BRIGHT基准上，ERank-4B达到nDCG@10为38.7，32B变体达到最先进的40.2

Conclusion: ERank成功解决了重排序模型中效率与效果之间的权衡问题，为推理密集型应用提供了既高效又准确的解决方案

Abstract: Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant
documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs)
powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised
Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary
classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for
those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for
complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations,
rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this
dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise
reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance
scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and
train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which
significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further
refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived
reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient
pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR,
TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and
robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT
benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant
reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.

Abstract: High-quality datasets are typically required for accomplishing data-driven
tasks, such as training medical diagnosis models, predicting real-time traffic
conditions, or conducting experiments to validate research hypotheses.
Consequently, open dataset search, which aims to ensure the efficient and
accurate fulfillment of users' dataset requirements, has emerged as a critical
research challenge and has attracted widespread interest. Recent studies have
made notable progress in enhancing the flexibility and intelligence of open
dataset search, and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
potential in addressing long-standing challenges in this area. Therefore, a
systematic and comprehensive review of the open dataset search problem is
essential, detailing the current state of research and exploring future
directions. In this survey, we focus on recent advances in open dataset search
beyond traditional approaches that rely on metadata and keywords. From the
perspective of dataset modalities, we place particular emphasis on
example-based dataset search, advanced similarity measurement techniques based
on dataset content, and efficient search acceleration techniques. In addition,
we emphasize the mutually beneficial relationship between LLMs and open dataset
search. On the one hand, LLMs help address complex challenges in query
understanding, semantic modeling, and interactive guidance within open dataset
search. In turn, advances in dataset search can support LLMs by enabling more
effective integration into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks and
data selection processes, thereby enhancing downstream task performance.
Finally, we summarize open research problems and outline promising directions
for future work. This work aims to offer a structured reference for researchers
and practitioners in the field of open dataset search.

Motivation: 现有PDF解析方法主要针对研究论文分割，难以处理法律教科书等复杂结构化文档的层次分割需求，需要开发更有效的解析工具。

Method: 研究基于目录的技术、开源结构解析工具和无目录输入的LLM方法，并整合OCR标题检测、XML特征和上下文文本特征等预处理策略来提升解析精度。

Conclusion: 通过比较评估各种方法的优缺点，为复杂结构化文档的层次分割提供了有效解决方案，所有代码和数据已公开以支持复现。

Abstract: The growing demand for effective tools to parse PDF-formatted texts,
particularly structured documents such as textbooks, reveals the limitations of
current methods developed mainly for research paper segmentation. This work
addresses the challenge of hierarchical segmentation in complex structured
documents, with a focus on legal textbooks that contain layered knowledge
essential for interpreting and applying legal norms. We examine a Table of
Contents (TOC)-based technique and approaches that rely on open-source
structural parsing tools or Large Language Models (LLMs) operating without
explicit TOC input. To enhance parsing accuracy, we incorporate preprocessing
strategies such as OCR-based title detection, XML-derived features, and
contextual text features. These strategies are evaluated based on their ability
to identify section titles, allocate hierarchy levels, and determine section
boundaries. Our findings show that combining LLMs with structure-aware
preprocessing substantially reduces false positives and improves extraction
quality. We also find that when the metadata quality of headings in the PDF is
high, TOC-based techniques perform particularly well. All code and data are
publicly available to support replication. We conclude with a comparative
evaluation of the methods, outlining their respective strengths and
limitations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于检索增强生成(RAG)的自动化方法，用于从DBpedia知识库中检索地名起源信息，解决了传统地名词典缺乏地名来源信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地名作为重要的空间参考信息，往往缺乏关于其历史、文化和社会背景的起源信息。传统的地名丰富化过程需要大量人工查阅文档，效率低下。自然语言处理和语言模型的发展为自动化这一过程提供了可能。

Method: 设计了一个检索增强生成管道：首先根据空间查询从DBpedia中提取可能相关的子图，然后使用微调的语言模型(ColBERTv2和Llama2)对提取的子图进行排序，最终生成查询答案。

Result: 研究结果突显了自动化检索地名起源面临的关键挑战，特别是语言模型倾向于较少利用文本中包含的空间信息作为区分因素。

Conclusion: 该方法为使用检索增强生成进行地理信息检索提供了更广泛的应用框架，展示了自动化地名起源检索的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Who is the "Batman" behind "Batman Street" in Melbourne? Understanding the
historical, cultural, and societal narratives behind place names can reveal the
rich context that has shaped a community. Although place names serve as
essential spatial references in gazetteers, they often lack information about
place name origins. Enriching these place names in today's gazetteers is a
time-consuming, manual process that requires extensive exploration of a vast
archive of documents and text sources. Recent advances in natural language
processing and language models (LMs) hold the promise of significant automation
of identifying place name origins due to their powerful capability to exploit
the semantics of the stored documents. This chapter presents a retrieval
augmented generation pipeline designed to search for place name origins over a
broad knowledge base, DBpedia. Given a spatial query, our approach first
extracts sub-graphs that may contain knowledge relevant to the query; then
ranks the extracted sub-graphs to generate the final answer to the query using
fine-tuned LM-based models (i.e., ColBERTv2 and Llama2). Our results highlight
the key challenges facing automated retrieval of place name origins, especially
the tendency of language models to under-use the spatial information contained
in texts as a discriminating factor. Our approach also frames the wider
implications for geographic information retrieval using retrieval augmented
generation.

TL;DR: SolveRank是一个面向竞争性编程的解决方案感知排序模型，通过合成数据训练，能够准确检索具有相似解决方案的问题和代码，提升代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程问题通常包含复杂的叙述背景，现有代码生成模型容易受到无关叙述的干扰。虽然检索类似解决方案的参考代码可能有助于提升性能，但现有检索模型只关注表面语义相似性，忽视了解决方案层面的逻辑相似性。

Method: 利用DeepSeek-R1生成逻辑等价但表述不同的新问题，通过GPT-4o验证解决方案一致性。使用这些合成数据作为正样本，BM25/随机检索的问题作为负样本训练SolveRank模型。推理时从语料库中检索相关问题和代码来辅助下游代码生成器。

Conclusion: SolveRank通过解决方案感知的检索方法有效解决了竞争性编程中深层逻辑相似性识别的问题，为代码生成任务提供了有价值的参考信息。

Abstract: In competitive programming task, problem statements are often embedded within
elaborate narrative backgrounds, requiring deep understanding of the underlying
solutions to successfully complete the tasks. Current code generation models
primarily focus on token-level semantic modeling, highly susceptible to
distractions from irrelevant narrative statements. Inspired by RAG, retrieving
reference code with similar solutions may help enhance model performance on
difficult problems. However, existing retrieval models also emphasize
surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the deeper solution-level logical
similarities that are critical in competitive programming. Therefore, designing
ranking models capable of accurately identifying and retrieving problems and
corresponding codes remains an urgent research problem in competitive code
generation. In this paper, we propose SolveRank, a solution-aware ranking model
empowered by synthetic data for competitive programming tasks. Specifically, we
leverage the DeepSeek-R1 model to generate logically equivalent but differently
phrased new problems, verified by GPT-4o for solution consistency. Then, we
train SolveRank with these as positive samples and BM25/random-retrieved
problems as negatives. During inference, SolveRank retrieves relevant problems
and corresponding code from the corpus to assist a downstream code generator.
Experiments on the xCodeEval dataset demonstrate that SolveRank outperforms
SOTA ranking methods in precision and recall metrics, and boosts code
generation performance for difficult problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CTR模型在用户行为建模方面表现良好，但在低活跃用户场景下受限于交互稀疏性。现有数据增强方法过度依赖协同信号而忽略了物品的多模态特征

Method: 使用Stein核方法将文本和图像特征对齐到统一的语义空间，构建多模态用户嵌入，通过检索、过滤和浓缩高活跃用户的最相似行为序列来增强低活跃用户序列

Conclusion: MARS框架通过多模态特征对齐和序列增强有效解决了低活跃用户的CTR预测问题，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction serves as a cornerstone of recommender
systems. Despite the strong performance of current CTR models based on user
behavior modeling, they are still severely limited by interaction sparsity,
especially in low-active user scenarios. To address this issue, data
augmentation of user behavior is a promising research direction. However,
existing data augmentation methods heavily rely on collaborative signals while
overlooking the rich multimodal features of items, leading to insufficient
modeling of low-active users.
  To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel framework \textbf{MARS}
(\textbf{M}odality-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{R}etrieval for \textbf{S}equence
Augmented CTR Prediction). MARS utilizes a Stein kernel-based approach to align
text and image features into a unified and unbiased semantic space to construct
multimodal user embeddings. Subsequently, each low-active user's behavior
sequence is augmented by retrieving, filtering, and concentrating the most
similar behavior sequence of high-active users via multimodal user embeddings.
Validated by extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests, our framework
MARS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves
substantial growth on core business metrics within
Kuaishou~\footnote{https://www.kuaishou.com/}. Consequently, MARS has been
successfully deployed, serving the main traffic for hundreds of millions of
users. To ensure reproducibility, we provide anonymous access to the
implementation code~\footnote{https://github.com/wangshukuan/MARS}.

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了可泛化的解决方案和原则性的评估套件，推动了时序感知检索系统的发展

Abstract: Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) is a critical yet unresolved task for
modern search systems, retrieving documents that not only satisfy a query's
information need but also adhere to its temporal constraints. This task is
shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's
explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document
among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in
isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal
requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we
introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and
evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this
foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that
dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware
gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading
in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity
tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders
and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a
principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware
retrieval systems. Re3 and Re2Bench are available online:

Conclusion: 该框架在异构和资源受限环境中有效实现了实时响应性、提高的效率和细粒度个性化

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agent-based
recommendation systems with strong semantic understanding and flexible
reasoning capabilities. While LLM-based agents deployed in the cloud offer
powerful personalization, they often suffer from privacy concerns, limited
access to real-time signals, and scalability bottlenecks. Conversely, on-device
agents ensure privacy and responsiveness but lack the computational power for
global modeling and large-scale retrieval. To bridge these complementary
limitations, we propose CDA4Rec, a novel Cloud-Device collaborative framework
for sequential Recommendation, powered by dual agents: a cloud-side LLM and a
device-side small language model (SLM). CDA4Rec tackles the core challenge of
cloud-device coordination by decomposing the recommendation task into modular
sub-tasks including semantic modeling, candidate retrieval, structured user
modeling, and final ranking, which are allocated to cloud or device based on
computational demands and privacy sensitivity. A strategy planning mechanism
leverages the cloud agent's reasoning ability to generate personalized
execution plans, enabling context-aware task assignment and partial parallel
execution across agents. This design ensures real-time responsiveness, improved
efficiency, and fine-grained personalization, even under diverse user states
and behavioral sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDA4Rec consistently outperforms competitive
baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, validating its effectiveness in
heterogeneous and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to capture users' dynamic interests and
sequential patterns based on their historical interactions. Recently, the
powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their
adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing
LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained
collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings
when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead
to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like
Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which
integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding
collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction
loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve
intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations,
respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the
model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the
LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior
performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse
and catastrophic forgetting. The implementation code and datasets are publicly
available for reproduction:

Abstract: News recommendations are complex, with diversity playing a vital role. So
far, existing literature predominantly focuses on specific aspects of news
diversity, such as viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce multi-aspect
diversification in four distinct recommendation modes and outline the nuanced
challenges in diversifying lists, sequences, summaries, and interactions. Our
proposed research direction combines symbolic and subsymbolic artificial
intelligence, leveraging both knowledge graphs and rule learning. We plan to
evaluate our models using user studies to not only capture behavior but also
their perceived experience. Our vision to balance news consumption points to
other positive effects for users (e.g., increased serendipity) and society
(e.g., decreased polarization).

Abstract: The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems,
coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent
need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This
paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and
enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical
documents. By exploiting LLMs, we aim to address the challenges of knowledge
retention, enabling the retrieval of domain expertise embedded in legacy
documentation. We present initial results of adapting LLMs to this specialized
domain. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting,
summarizing, and organizing knowledge, significantly reducing the risk of
losing valuable insights as personnel retire. Furthermore, we discuss the
limitations of current LLMs, such as interpretability and handling of rare
domain-specific terms, and propose strategies for improvement. This work
highlights the potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in preserving
institutional knowledge and ensuring continuity in highly specialized fields.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于新闻框架多样化的推荐方法，通过控制媒体框架作为推荐维度，显著提升用户接触不同叙事角度的多样性，实验显示未点击框架曝光率提升达50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点击式新闻推荐系统局限于用户历史偏好，缺乏内容多样性。虽然基于情感或类别的多样化方法有所进展，但忽视了新闻框架（叙事角度）对用户理解的重要影响。

Method: 将媒体框架作为可控维度引入推荐流程，开发基于框架多样化的推荐方法，并使用代表性、校准和激活等规范性多样性指标进行评估。

Result: 实验表明媒体框架多样化方法使未点击框架的曝光率提升高达50%，同时在类别和情感层面也增强了多样性，证明框架是提升规范多样性的有效控制杠杆。

Conclusion: 新闻框架多样化能有效拓宽用户的理解视角，避免重复接触相同框架导致的偏见固化，为构建更全面的新闻推荐系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Click-based news recommender systems suggest users content that aligns with
their existing history, limiting the diversity of articles they encounter.
Recent advances in aspect-based diversification -- adding features such as
sentiments or news categories (e.g. world, politics) -- have made progress
toward diversifying recommendations in terms of perspectives. However, these
approaches often overlook the role of news framing, which shapes how stories
are told by emphasizing specific angles or interpretations. In this paper, we
treat media frames as a controllable aspect within the recommendation pipeline.
By selecting articles based on a diversity of frames, our approach emphasizes
varied narrative angles and broadens the interpretive space recommended to
users. In addition to introducing frame-based diversification method, our work
is the first to assess the impact of a news recommender system that integrates
frame diversity using normative diversity metrics: representation, calibration,
and activation. Our experiments based on media frame diversification show an
improvement in exposure to previously unclicked frames up to 50%. This is
important because repeated exposure to the same frames can reinforce existing
biases or narrow interpretations, whereas introducing novel frames broadens
users' understanding of issues and perspectives. The method also enhances
diversification across categorical and sentiment levels, thereby demonstrating
that framing acts as a strong control lever for enhancing normative diversity.

TL;DR: 提出CTQE方法，通过利用LLM解码过程中未选中的候选token来扩展查询，在单次推理中实现相关性和多样性，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的查询扩展方法面临性能与计算成本的权衡：生成多样化术语能提升检索性能但增加计算开销。

Method: CTQE从单次LLM解码过程中提取未被选中的候选token，这些token基于完整查询生成并包含有用信息，通过聚合这些token实现查询扩展。

Result: 实验表明CTQE在显著降低成本和延迟的同时，提供强大的检索性能，优于或与更昂贵的方法相当。

Conclusion: CTQE通过巧妙利用LLM解码过程中的候选token，实现了高效且有效的查询扩展，解决了性能与成本的权衡问题。

Abstract: Query Expansion (QE) improves retrieval performance by enriching queries with
related terms. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for QE,
but existing methods face a trade-off: generating diverse terms boosts
performance but increases computational cost. To address this challenge, we
propose Candidate Token Query Expansion (CTQE), which extracts diverse and
relevant terms from a single LLM decoding pass by leveraging unselected
candidate tokens. These tokens, though not part of the final output, are
conditioned on the full query and capture useful information. By aggregating
them, CTQE achieves both relevance and diversity without extra inference,
reducing overhead and latency. Experiments show that CTQE delivers strong
retrieval performance with significantly lower cost, outperforming or
comparable to more expensive methods. Code is available at:

Motivation: 研究旨在为推理密集型查询建立可复现的检索基线，探索不同检索和重排序方法的效果，并解决BM25在长查询处理中的实现差异问题。

Method: 使用稀疏检索、稠密检索和融合方法在BRIGHT数据集上进行检索实验，应用基于大语言模型的列表重排序，比较不同BM25实现方式的效果差异。

Result: 发现BRIGHT的BM25实现与标准工具包存在显著差异，这种差异在长查询场景下尤为明显，研究在Anserini和Pyserini中集成了查询端BM25功能。

Conclusion: 随着长查询和检索增强生成应用的普及，需要重新考虑BM25方法以适应新兴应用需求，研究提供了可复现的基线和改进的工具支持。

Abstract: The BRIGHT benchmark is a dataset consisting of reasoning-intensive queries
over diverse domains. We explore retrieval results on BRIGHT using a range of
retrieval techniques, including sparse, dense, and fusion methods, and
establish reproducible baselines. We then apply listwise reranking with large
language models (LLMs) to further investigate the impact of reranking on
reasoning-intensive queries. These baselines are integrated into popular
retrieval and reranking toolkits Anserini, Pyserini, and RankLLM, with
two-click reproducibility that makes them easy to build upon and convenient for
further development. While attempting to reproduce the results reported in the
original BRIGHT paper, we find that the provided BM25 scores differ notably
from those that we obtain using Anserini and Pyserini. We discover that this
difference is due to BRIGHT's implementation of BM25, which applies BM25 on the
query rather than using the standard bag-of-words approach, as in Anserini, to
construct query vectors. This difference has become increasingly relevant due
to the rise of longer queries, with BRIGHT's lengthy reasoning-intensive
queries being a prime example, and further accentuated by the increasing usage
of retrieval-augmented generation, where LLM prompts can grow to be much longer
than ''traditional'' search engine queries. Our observation signifies that it
may be time to reconsider BM25 approaches going forward in order to better
accommodate emerging applications. To facilitate this, we integrate query-side
BM25 into both Anserini and Pyserini.

Conclusion: 交叉条件化技术的效果依赖于偏微分方程的特性和物理机制，通过统计分析验证了方法的稳健性和有效性。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

Conclusion: 机器学习和大语言模型在急救精神病诊断中具有潜在应用价值，可作为辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

Motivation: 数据湖训练模型存在严重的隐私风险，攻击者可以通过模型参数嵌入或诱导记忆化来窃取敏感医疗数据，需要有效的防御方法。

Method: 在模型导出时使用衰减的分层学习率进行微调，扰动模型参数以破坏嵌入的数据表示，同时保持原始任务的性能。

Result: 在DermaMNIST、ChestMNIST和MIMIC-CXR数据集上验证，方法保持任务性能，有效破坏最先进的数据窃取攻击，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据湖训练模型和集中式联邦学习提供了实用的数据泄露防御方案，但自适应攻击仍存在挑战需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

Motivation: 现有低比特后训练量化方法存在精度下降问题，而传统量化感知训练依赖反向传播导致数据、时间和内存成本过高，限制了实用性

Result: 实验证明ZeroQAT实现了后训练量化的效率，同时保持了量化感知训练的精度

Conclusion: ZeroQAT为LLMs的高质量低比特量化提供了一个实用的解决方案，平衡了效率和精度

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了先进制程节点芯片性能预测的挑战，通过转移学习和芯片传感器数据的结合，提供了更准确的Vmin预测能力

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship
between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a
novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced
5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features
derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the
5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-FloPS是一种无需训练的高效扩散模型采样框架，通过重新参数化采样轨迹和自适应速度分解，在极低函数评估次数（如5次）下实现更高质量的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优异，但由于迭代采样过程导致计算成本高昂。现有的无训练加速方法受限于采样轨迹效率，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出A-FloPS框架：1）将预训练扩散模型的采样轨迹重新参数化为流匹配形式；2）采用自适应速度分解机制，将速度场分解为线性漂移项和残差分量；3）抑制残差分量的时间变化，实现高阶积分精度。

Result: 在条件图像生成和文本到图像合成任务中，A-FloPS在样本质量和效率方面均优于最先进的无训练采样器，仅用5次函数评估就能获得显著更低的FID分数和更清晰、更连贯的图像。

Conclusion: A-FloPS为高质量、低延迟生成建模提供了一个通用有效的解决方案，其自适应机制还能改进基于流的原生生成模型，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型不同层权重分布的相关性及其对LoRA训练效果的影响，探索通过权重分布特征优化LoRA初始化的方法。

Method: 1) 分析不同层权重余弦距离的幂律分布特征；2) 提出定性方法描述模型分布特征；3) 结合高斯过程和帕累托分布设计数据生成器；4) 基于分布特征重塑LoRA初始化权重

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在不改变模型结构或训练过程的情况下，实现了LoRA训练性能的一定提升。

Conclusion: 大语言模型权重分布具有明显的幂律特征，利用这一特征优化LoRA初始化可以有效提升训练效果，为模型微调提供了新的优化思路。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类大脑记忆巩固机制的启发，研究内部回放机制在持续学习中的作用，特别是针对灾难性遗忘问题，因为内部回放被确定为脑启发机制中最有影响力的组件。

Method: 使用CIFAR-100数据集在类增量设置下评估内部回放机制的有效性，单独使用以及与突触智能(SI)结合使用。通过对数似然分布、重建误差、轮廓系数和UMAP投影等分析方法评估表征重叠。

Result: 内部回放显著减轻了遗忘，特别是与SI结合时效果更好，但代价是降低了初始任务准确性。分析表明内部回放增加了潜在空间的表征重叠，可能限制了任务特异性区分。

Conclusion: 当前脑启发方法存在局限性，需要在持续学习系统中平衡记忆保持和适应能力，为未来研究方向提供了启示。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实验方法耗时、容易出错且无法抓取地质异质性，需要更有效的氢气吸附预测方法来支持地下氢气储存、自然氢气挖掘和放射性废料安全

Method: 开发了一种适应性物理信息神经网络(PINN)框架，结合经典吸附线模型和热力学约束，使用深度殊差网络和多头注意力机制，通过适应损失函数和Monte Carlo dropout进行不确定性量化

Result: 在155个样本的综合数据集上得到高精度(R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol/kg)，汇合速度提高67%，在泥岩矿物(R2=0.981)、岸岩(R2=0.971)和煤矿(R2=0.978)上都表现稳定，可靠性评分达85-91%

Conclusion: 该框架通过物理信息融合和深度学习提高了氢气吸附预测的准确性和可靠性，为地下氢气储存和自然氢气挖掘提供了有力的技术支撑

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

Result: 发现了俄罗斯空间物体活动的统计显著异常，并详细识别了各个轨道元素的异常变化

Conclusion: 深度学习模型能有效检测空间物体行为模式的异常变化，为军事冲突预警提供可靠的技术手段

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

Motivation: 光网络中机器学习故障管理面临严重的类别不平衡问题，正常实例远多于故障案例，而后处理方法在此领域研究较少

Method: 使用实验数据集对预处理、处理中和后处理三种类别不平衡缓解方法进行直接比较，包括阈值调整、随机欠采样、SMOTE过采样、元学习和生成式AI等方法

Result: 故障检测中后处理方法（特别是阈值调整）F1分数提升最高达15.3%，随机欠采样推理速度最快；故障识别中生成式AI方法性能提升最大达24.2%；存在类别重叠且延迟关键时SMOTE最有效，无延迟约束时元学习效果最佳；低重叠场景中生成式AI方法性能最高且推理时间最短

Conclusion: 不同场景下应选择不同的类别不平衡处理方法：故障检测优选后处理，故障识别优选生成式AI，需根据类别重叠情况和延迟要求选择合适方法

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

Method: 在MLP隐藏层上附加多个输出分支（称为尾部），通过直接监督多个深度来实现多尺度建模。采用特定的损失函数和训练策略，使每个隐藏层能够有效学习特定LoD的目标信号。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，T-MLP在多种信号表示任务中都优于其他神经LoD基线方法。

Conclusion: T-MLP架构成功扩展了MLP的能力，使其能够有效支持多尺度信号表示，为层次细节建模提供了新的神经网络解决方案。

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great

especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte

generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient

integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Generative Self-Refinement (GSR)框架，通过并行生成候选答案并进行自我精炼来提升大语言模型解决复杂推理问题的能力，无需额外模型即可实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法如Best-of-N和多数投票依赖于候选答案质量，当所有候选答案都错误时无法产生正确解决方案，且引入额外模型选择最佳答案会带来显著部署成本。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中达到最先进性能，学习到的自我精炼技能具有模型无关性，在不同模型规模上表现稳健，并能泛化到分布外推理任务。

Conclusion: GSR框架有效解决了现有测试时缩放方法的局限性，通过自我精炼机制显著提升了大语言模型解决复杂推理问题的能力，且具有良好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了采用联邦学习(Federated Learning)技术在巴西教育预测中的应用，在遵循隐私保护法规的前提下实现了与集中式模型相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育领域的数据挖掘和AI应用遇到隐私法规的限制，导致敏感学生数据无法集中处理，需要找到无需数据集中的隐私保护计算方案。

Method: 采用FedProx联邦学习算法，基于深度神经网络(DNN)模型，在50所学校的模拟场景中进行学生成绩预测，并与集中式XGBoost模型进行性能对比。

Result: 集中式模型准确率63.96%，联邦学习模型最高达到61.23%，性能损失很小，但提供了强大的隐私保护。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是一种可行且有效的解决方案，能够在遵循巴西数据保护法的前提下建立协作预测模型。

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种改进LSTM的方法：输入重排序、权重归一化和门非线性化，在文本分类任务中提升了LSTM的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LSTM模型虽然通过门控机制处理长期信息，但未能最优地关注特定旧索引或长期信息，且缺乏对权重归一化和门非线性化的深入研究。

Method: 1) 输入重排序方法优先处理特定输入索引；2) 通过监督损失函数选择最佳Lp范数进行权重归一化；3) 使用小型前馈神经网络对门进行非线性化增强。

Result: 在文本分类任务中，所提出的方法相比简单LSTM提高了准确率。

Conclusion: 输入重排序、权重归一化和门非线性化是提升LSTM性能的有效方法，特别是在处理长期依赖关系和特定输入模式方面。

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成对抗训练方法独立训练子模型，忽略了子模型间的协作优势，分类差异大的样本对集成鲁棒性影响更大

Method: 利用子模型间的概率差异自适应分配样本权重，加入校准距离正则化，使预测差异大的样本在其他子模型训练中获得更多关注

Result: 在广泛采用的数据集上实现了最先进的性能，优于竞争性EAT方法

Conclusion: CEAT是模型无关的，可以无缝适配各种集成方法，具有灵活的适用性

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

Conclusion: 这项工作首次提供了强有力的证据，表明在真实条件下检测合成表格数据不仅可行，而且可以高可靠性地完成。

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

Motivation: 职业事故报告自动分类对提升工作场所安全至关重要，但现实数据集的严重类别不平衡问题影响了模型性能，特别是对罕见但严重的事故类型。

Method: 提出ABEX-RAT框架：1）ABEX两步流程：使用大语言模型提取核心事故语义，再用生成模型为少数类创建高质量合成样本；2）RAT对抗训练：在增强数据上使用随机对抗训练协议，通过随机扰动提升模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这种协同策略是处理专业、不平衡分类任务的高效替代方案，验证了生成式数据增强与对抗训练结合的有效性。

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

Motivation: 发现现有的LLM剪枝方法会破坏模型内部用于谎言检测的关键激活特征，导致剪枝后的模型无法有效检测其生成内容的真实性，这是一个重要的安全问题。

Method: 提出Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO)方法，通过重点关注包含更多激活异常值和更强判别特征的层来进行剪枝，同时引入新的提示规则来丰富TruthfulQA基准。

Result: 在50%稀疏度下实现了88%的幻觉检测准确率，显著提升了剪枝后LLM在TruthfulQA基准上的性能表现。

Conclusion: TPLO方法成功解决了LLM剪枝与谎言检测能力之间的冲突，为在资源受限环境下部署可信LLM提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

Conclusion: PEGE提供了一种统一且可普遍化的框架，能够有效地解决量化训练中的离散化误差问题，为资源受限硬件上部署深度神经网络提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

Result: PMA方法能够有效利用各层表示多样性，提升下游任务性能

Conclusion: 最后一层表示并非最优，PMA方法通过层间表示融合显著提升ECG Transformer模型性能

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

Motivation: 传统实验化学优化使用黑盒参数空间的算法搜索，但大型语言模型的预训练知识可能改变这一范式，需要系统评估LLM在化学优化中的表现。

Method: 使用6个完全枚举的分类反应数据集（768-5684个实验），比较LLM引导优化与贝叶斯优化和随机采样，引入拓扑无关的信息论框架量化采样多样性。

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Flow-Matching Neural ODE (FNODE)框架，通过直接学习加速度矢量场来解决约束多体系统建模中的计算成本高和长期预测精度有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动的多体系统建模面临两个主要挑战：高计算成本和有限的长期预测精度。传统Neural ODE需要通过ODE求解器进行反向传播，这成为计算瓶颈。

Method: FNODE通过重新制定训练目标，直接监督加速度而非积分状态，避免了通过ODE求解器的反向传播。使用数值微分技术（包括混合FFT和有限差分方案）高效计算加速度目标。

Result: 在多个基准测试（单/三质量-弹簧-阻尼系统、双摆、滑块曲柄、车杆系统）中，FNODE在准确性、泛化能力和计算效率方面均优于MBD-NODE、LSTM和FCNN等现有方法。

Conclusion: FNODE框架通过直接学习加速度矢量场，有效解决了约束多体系统建模中的计算瓶颈和精度问题，在多个测试案例中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural
Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: FlashTTS是一个针对边缘设备的测试时缩放(TTS)服务系统，通过三项优化技术使小型LLM在内存受限环境下达到大型云模型的推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备部署AI代理需要隐私和响应性，但内存限制迫使使用推理能力较差的小型LLM，现有TTS方法在边缘硬件上开销过大

Method: 引入三项协同优化：推测性波束扩展缓解系统延迟、非对称多模型内存分配动态平衡内存、动态前缀感知调度最大化KV缓存重用

Result: 在单消费级GPU(24GB)上，FlashTTS使边缘LLM达到大型云模型的准确性和延迟，相比vLLM基线平均吞吐量提高2.2倍，延迟降低38%-68%

Conclusion: FlashTTS为边缘设备上民主化、高性能的代理AI铺平了道路，可作为vLLM的即插即用库使用

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

Conclusion: 联邦学习公平性是一个关键研究领域，需要进一步发展更有效的公平性技术来推动联邦学习在实际应用中的广泛部署。

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

TL;DR: TConstFormer通过周期性状态更新机制实现恒定大小的KV缓存和O(1)计算复杂度，在长文本推理任务中展现出显著的速度和内存效率优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer自回归推理中KV缓存线性增长和O(N^2 d)计算复杂度的问题，以处理超长序列

Method: 基于TLinFormer工作，采用创新的周期性状态更新机制，在k-1个连续步骤进行恒定时间计算，仅在第k步执行一次线性时间全局信息同步

Result: 理论和实验结果表明，TConstFormer在长文本推理任务的速度、内存效率和整体性能方面相比基线模型具有压倒性优势

Conclusion: 这一突破为高效和鲁棒的流式语言模型应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

TL;DR: Neptune是一种新的参数场推断方法，使用独立坐标神经网络从稀疏观测中准确估计非线性时空变化的PDE参数，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数估计方法（如稀疏识别和PINNs）在处理非线性动态、多物理场相互作用或有限系统响应观测时存在困难，特别是在参数具有非线性和时空变化的情况下。

Method: Neptune采用独立坐标神经网络在物理空间或状态变量中连续表示每个参数场，能够从稀疏测量中推断参数场。

Result: Neptune在各种物理和生物医学问题上显著优于现有方法，仅需50个观测即可实现稳健参数估计，参数估计误差比PINNs降低两个数量级，动态响应预测误差降低十倍。

Conclusion: Neptune通过实现可靠且数据高效的参数推断，在工程、医疗等领域具有广泛的变革性影响，并展现出优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,
healthcare, and beyond.

TL;DR: Learn to Shard是首个基于强化学习的方法，共同优化分布式LLM推理中的粗粒度并行度和细粒度算子分片维度，在H100集群上相比现有方法实现了最高3.5倍的吞吐量提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分布式LLM推理系统（如Megatron-LM）使用静态启发式方法分别配置并行度和算子分片维度，随着模型规模扩大和硬件拓扑多样化，这种方法无法充分利用性能潜力

Method: 采用基于注意力的强化学习策略，从高性能策略历史中学习，有效探索巨大的组合搜索空间，共同优化粗粒度并行度和细粒度算子分片维度

Result: 在H100集群上测试1.6T参数的MoE模型，相比元启发式基线实现最高3.5倍吞吐量提升，相比Megatron启发式方法提升1.06倍

Conclusion: Learn to Shard通过强化学习方法有效解决了分布式LLM推理中的并行策略优化问题，显著提升了大规模模型推理性能

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

Method: 使用HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0语音基础模型提取特征，然后在这些特征上训练简单的探测分类器，用于可穿戴传感器的时间序列分类任务。

Result: 基于语音模型特征训练的探测器在多个传感器任务上表现优于直接在模态特定数据集上训练的自监督模型，特别是卷积特征编码器对可穿戴传感器任务表现出强相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了数据稀缺时间序列任务的性能和鲁棒性，为构建通用的语音和传感器时间序列模型迈出了重要一步，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

Result: 在ETT、Traffic和Exchange Rate三个基准测试中 consistently优于LSTM、TCN、Reformer、Transformer和S-Mamba等基线模型

Conclusion: 变分量子门机制能够有效解决长时序预测中的现有限制，实现准确且鲁棒的多变量预测

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Conclusion: 连续温度扩散采样器通过改进探索机制，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了采样性能

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available
at https://github.com/eje24/ctds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TabPFN v2因Transformer二次计算复杂度而无法处理长上下文（超过10K标记）的问题，避免现有方法依赖上下文压缩（如KNN选择代表性样本）的局限性。

Method: 引入tiled-block策略在TabPFN框架内计算注意力，该设计与标准GPU设置兼容，无需任何预处理即可处理长上下文。

Result: 在标准TabArena基准测试中证明了该方法的有效性，使TabPFN能够处理长上下文。

Conclusion: 提出的tiled-block策略成功解决了TabPFN处理长上下文的限制，为表格数据分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Motivation: 基于隐式反馈的推荐系统存在曝光偏差问题，传统的逆倾向评分(IPS)方法虽然能纠正偏差但存在高方差和不稳定性。

Method: 提出了一个集成IPS加权训练和IPS加权BPR目标的流程，并加入倾向性正则化(PR)来缓解极端倾向权重带来的方差放大问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实推荐场景中的反事实学习和评估提供了实用指导，能够更好地处理曝光偏差问题。

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

*An B. Vuong,Michael T. McCann,Javier E. Santos,Yen Ting Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散模型实际上学习的不是保守的分数函数，而是Wasserstein梯度流的速度场，这解释了为什么即使神经网络向量场不是真正的分数函数，生成采样仍然成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为扩散模型学习的是噪声数据的对数密度梯度（分数函数），但这要求学习目标是保守向量场，而实际使用的神经网络架构并未强制执行这一约束。研究发现训练后的扩散网络违反了真正分数函数的约束条件。

Method: 通过数值证据展示训练后的扩散网络违反分数函数的积分和微分约束，提出从Wasserstein梯度流（WGF）速度场的流匹配角度来理解扩散训练，而不是基于反向时间SDE的分数学习。

Result: 研究表明扩散网络学习的向量场不是保守的，但作为生成机制表现优异。从WGF视角看，"概率流"自然产生，神经网络近似产生的非保守误差不一定损害密度传输。

Conclusion: WGF视角为理解扩散生成模型提供了原则性、优雅且理论基础坚实的框架，应取代传统的分数学习观点。

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

work, we identify and solve several key challenges in scaling hierarchical RL
to high-throughput environments. We propose Scalable Option Learning (SOL), a
highly scalable hierarchical RL algorithm which achieves a 25x higher
throughput compared to existing hierarchical methods. We train our hierarchical
agents using 20 billion frames of experience on the complex game of NetHack,
significantly surpassing flat agents and demonstrating positive scaling trends.
We also validate our algorithm on MiniHack and Mujoco environments, showcasing
its general applicability. Our code is open sourced at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LLMDPD方法，通过结合文本任务描述和轨迹提示来增强离线强化学习的泛化能力，利用大语言模型处理文本提示，transformer编码轨迹，通过策略级扩散模型实现对新任务的泛化。

Conclusion: LLMDPD成功解决了离线RL的泛化问题，通过结合文本和轨迹提示，利用LLM的强大能力，为离线强化学习提供了有效的泛化解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从理论角度解释了物理增强残差学习(PERL)方法的三个优势：减少神经网络参数数量、加快收敛速度、减少训练样本需求，并通过自动驾驶轨迹预测案例验证了理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然数值实验显示PERL方法在整合物理模型和神经网络方面具有参数少、收敛快、样本需求少等优势，但这些结果缺乏理论解释，需要从理论层面进行严格证明。

Method: 研究具有Lipschitz连续性特性的一类通用问题，通过分析损失函数边界与残差学习结构之间的关系，严格证明了解释PERL三个优势的定理集。

Result: 理论证明和自动驾驶轨迹预测的数值实验均证实，即使使用显著更少的训练样本，PERL仍能比纯神经网络获得更高的精度。

Conclusion: PERL在提高预测性能的同时减少了数据需求，在真实世界自动驾驶应用中具有重要价值，特别是在难以获取极端案例数据的情况下。

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门针对ReLU网络的优化正交初始化方法，通过Stiefel流形上的优化问题来校准预激活统计量，解决了深度网络中神经元失活和梯度消失问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的权重初始化方法（如He、Xavier、正交初始化）在深度ReLU网络中无法有效调节预激活均值和控制激活稀疏性，导致神经元永久失活（dying ReLU）和梯度不稳定问题

Method: 在Stiefel流形上求解优化问题，得到专门为ReLU优化的正交初始化方法，推导出闭式解和高效采样方案，从初始化阶段就保持尺度并校准预激活统计量

Result: 理论分析表明该方法能防止dying ReLU问题、减缓激活方差衰减、缓解梯度消失，实验在多个数据集和ReLU族激活函数上优于现有初始化方法，实现了深度网络的稳定训练

Conclusion: 提出的优化正交初始化方法有效解决了深度ReLU网络的训练稳定性问题，为深度神经网络提供了更可靠的初始化方案

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法主要局限于特定数据集和GNN类型，缺乏统一的扰动框架来提升GNN对节点特征和图结构攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: PerturbEmbedding方法直接在GNN的每个隐藏嵌入层执行扰动操作，提供了统一的扰动策略框架，支持随机扰动和对抗性扰动两种形式。

Result: 在多个数据集和不同骨干模型上的实验表明，PerturbEmbedding显著提升了GNN的鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于现有方法，并能有效抵抗随机和对抗性扰动。

Conclusion: PerturbEmbedding提供了一个统一的扰动训练框架，有效增强了GNN对对抗攻击的抵抗力，同时改善了模型的泛化性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子图联邦学习面临严重的数据异构性问题，稀疏和偏置的子图容易导致快速过拟合，使客户端相似性矩阵停滞或崩溃，从而降低聚合效果。

Method: 采用课程学习(CL)自适应选择边进行训练，先暴露通用跨客户端子结构，再暴露客户端特定结构；使用随机参考图上重建的细粒度结构指标估计客户端相似性。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的广泛实验证实，CUFL相比相关基线方法取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: CUFL通过调节个性化过程，有效防止早期过拟合，实现渐进式个性化，并改进了加权聚合效果。

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at
https://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git.

TL;DR: Metis是一个低比特量化训练框架，通过谱分解、自适应学习率和双范围正则化解决了LLM训练中的各向异性参数分布问题，使FP8训练超越FP32基线，FP4训练达到FP32精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 各向异性参数分布是低比特量化训练LLM的主要障碍，少数主导奇异值产生宽数值范围，与块量化偏置冲突，导致训练不稳定和性能低下。

Method: 结合谱分解与随机嵌入分离主导和长尾分量；在谱域使用自适应学习率增强欠表示方向；双范围正则化联合约束数值精度和参数范围分布。

Conclusion: Metis为先进低比特量化下的鲁棒和可扩展LLM训练铺平了道路，解决了各向异性分布导致的量化冲突问题。

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

TL;DR: 本文证明了Transformer的记忆能力与提示长度呈线性关系，并首次形式化证明了大型语言模型在扩展上下文中的性能下降现象，揭示了Transformer架构处理长序列的内在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管提示调优在实践中有显著效果，但其理论分析仍然有限。现有理论研究主要关注通用逼近性质，而本文旨在探索Transformer的记忆能力这一不同理论方面。

Method: 通过理论分析证明两个主要结论：1）Transformer记忆的信息量不能快于提示长度的线性增长；2）形式化证明Transformer在扩展上下文中性能下降的现象。

Result: 证明了Transformer的记忆能力存在根本性限制，其信息记忆量受限于线性增长，无法随上下文长度无限扩展，这解释了长序列处理中的性能下降问题。

Conclusion: Transformer架构具有固有的有限记忆能力，无论上下文大小如何，其信息保留能力都受到约束，这为理解Transformer处理长序列的内在局限性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

Motivation: 输入依赖的激活稀疏性是深度学习模型的重要特性，但在ReLU模型中的方法无法直接迁移到现代大语言模型，当前研究分散且缺乏共识

Method: 提出了评估稀疏性鲁棒性的通用框架，对现代大语言模型（包括扩散LLMs）的FFN层进行系统性研究

Result: 发现了LLMs中激活稀疏性的普遍模式，为理解这一现象提供了见解

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了在模型设计和加速中利用激活稀疏性的实用指南

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

Method: 通过细粒度记忆化测量方法，分析不同图像自回归架构中的记忆化模式，定位记忆化发生的具体位置和阶段。

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

Conclusion: GAT框架能够有效利用通路拓扑结构，具有直接从实验数据生成新生物学假设的潜力。

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效降低全局模型性能，同时攻击者获得的集成模型显著优于全局模型

Conclusion: 自中心联邦学习攻击范式更符合现实攻击动机，FedThief框架成功实现了攻击者竞争优势的获取

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

Result: 在1,428家中国中小企业数据集上的实验显示，IMST达到88.9%的准确率，优于基准决策树(87.4%)以及逻辑回归、支持向量机等传统模型。

Conclusion: IMST框架在中小企业信用评估中表现出色，具有更高的准确性、更好的可解释性和计算效率，以及更强的风险检测能力。

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从图神经网络到Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的知识蒸馏框架SA-DSD，通过改进的FR-KAN+学生模型和自适应加权损失机制，在边缘计算环境中显著提升了模型性能并大幅降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算环境对模型压缩和推理速度有更高要求，需要将GNN的知识转移到更高效的MLP模型，但MLP难以快速捕获GNN学习的复杂邻域依赖关系。

Method: 改进Fourier KAN为FR-KAN+作为学生模型，引入可学习频率基和相移机制，构建基于师生预测一致性的边际级采样概率矩阵，设计自适应加权损失机制。

Result: 在6个真实数据集上，SA-DSD相比3个GNN教师模型性能提升3.05%-3.62%，相比FR-KAN+提升15.61%，参数减少16.96倍，推理时间降低55.75%。

Conclusion: SA-DSD框架有效解决了GNN到MLP知识蒸馏中的性能下降问题，为边缘计算环境提供了高效且性能优异的模型压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理短暂神经事件时往往不足，而先进的、事件特定的技术缺乏在Python生态系统中的可访问实现，需要开发一个用户友好的解决方案来研究复杂系统中的瞬态因果动态。

Method: TranCIT实现了全面的分析流程，包括Granger因果关系、传递熵，以及更稳健的基于结构因果模型的动态因果强度（DCS）和相对动态因果强度（rDCS），用于准确检测事件驱动的因果效应。

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于时间融合变换器(TFT)的机器学习框架，用于预测稀疏的欧洞层总电子含量(TEC)数据，实现了可靠的24小时预测，平方根误差仅3.33 TECU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洞层对全球定位系统、卫星通信和低地轨道运行至关重要，但其变化性预测因太阳、地磁和温层驱动因素的非线性耦合而极其困难。当前TEC预测受限于全球观测数据的稀疏性和经验模型的精度不足，特别是在强空间天气条件下。

Method: 采用时间融合变换器(TFT)机器学习框架，整合多种异构输入源（太阳辐射强度、地磁指数、GNSS水平TEC数据），应用预处理和时间对齐策略。实验跨越2010-2025年。

Result: 模型能够实现稳健的最长24小时预测，平方根误差最低可达3.33 TECU。结果显示太阳极紫外辐射提供了最强的预测信号。该框架还通过关注机制分析提供了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该机器学习框架为欧洞层TEC预测提供了高精度的解决方案，既支持操作应用也有助于科学发现。研究团队将完整实现以开源工具包ionopy形式发布，以促进可复现性和社区发展。

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

Motivation: 系统退化难以直接观测且被运行变化所沉淁，传统残差方法存在噪声大、可靠性低的问题，特别是在动态响应系统中

Method: 提出分层控制微分方程(H-CDE)框架，包含慢速(退化)和快速(运行)两个组件，采用多尺度时间积分、可学习路径变换和单调激活函数三项关键技术

Result: 在动态响应(桥梁)和稳态(航空发动机)系统上进行综合评估，H-CDE能有效解耦退化与运行动态，表现超过残差基准方法，实现更准确、更稳健和更可解释的推断

Conclusion: H-CDE框架成功解决了系统退化识别中的关键挑战，提供了一种更有效的方法来从传感器数据中推断潜在退化过程，为设备健康监测和预测性维护提供了更可靠的技术支撑

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

Conclusion: AMCR框架为解决生成模型版权问题提供了全面解决方案，能够在不影响图像质量的情况下有效减少版权侵权，促进生成技术的负责任部署

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

Motivation: 传统IPS方法在大动作空间或未充分探索的上下文-动作空间中存在显著方差问题，现有的MIPS方法虽然利用动作嵌入缓解了这一问题，但未考虑上下文信息且未优化均方误差。

Method: 提出CAEL-MIPS方法，从离线数据中学习上下文-动作嵌入，基于MIPS的偏差和方差理论分析，构建最小化均方误差的目标函数。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实数据集上的实验表明，该估计器在均方误差方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAEL-MIPS通过联合学习上下文-动作嵌入有效降低了MIPS估计器的均方误差，为离策略评估提供了更准确的估计方法。

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for

*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Haoyue Bai,Anjali Kaushik,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了DELTA框架，通过两阶段变分解耦生成学习实现隐私保护数据重编程，在提升预测性能的同时显著降低隐私泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据常包含敏感属性且受严格监管，现有特征工程主要关注下游任务性能而忽视隐私保护，需要新的方法来平衡效用和隐私。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用策略引导强化学习发现具有下游任务效用的特征变换；第二阶段采用变分LSTM seq2seq编码器-解码器，结合效用-隐私解耦潜在空间设计和对抗-因果解耦正则化来抑制隐私信号。

Result: 在8个数据集上的实验显示，DELTA将预测性能提升约9.3%，同时将隐私泄露降低约35%。

Conclusion: DELTA框架能够实现稳健、隐私感知的数据转换，有效解决了隐私保护数据重编程的挑战。

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGN网络将变分模态分解转化为可训练的神经模块，大幅提升时空预测效率，在LargeST基准上实现85-95%的预测误差降低和250倍分解速度提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络在时空预测中存在频谱纠缠问题，而分解集成方法如VMGCN虽然提高精度但计算效率低下且需要手动调参

Method: 提出模式自适应图网络(MAGN)，包含展开式VMD模块替代迭代优化，以及模式特定的可学习带宽约束来自适应空间异质性

Result: 在LargeST基准(6,902个传感器，2.41亿观测值)上，分解时间减少250倍，预测误差比VMGCN降低85-95%，优于最先进基线方法

Conclusion: MAGN成功解决了传统分解方法的计算效率和手动调参问题，为复杂系统的时空预测提供了高效准确的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Renfei Zhang,Mohit Pandey,Artem Cherkasov,Martin Ester*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BALD-GFlowNet是一个生成式主动学习框架，通过GFlowNets直接采样BALD奖励比例的对象，解决了传统池式主动学习在大规模未标记数据集上的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统池式主动学习方法（如BALD）在评估大规模未标记数据集时计算成本高昂，特别是在包含数十亿样本的药物发现虚拟筛选中，这种计算瓶颈限制了方法的可扩展性。

Method: 提出BALD-GFlowNet框架，利用生成流网络（GFlowNets）直接根据BALD奖励比例采样对象，用生成式采样替代传统的池式获取方法，使可扩展性与未标记池的大小无关。

Result: 在虚拟筛选实验中，BALD-GFlowNet实现了与标准BALD基线相当的性能，同时生成了结构更多样化的分子。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效且可扩展的分子发现提供了一个有前景的方向，通过生成式采样解决了大规模主动学习的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

*Jingtao Liu,Xinming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAAM是一种无需重放、资源高效的持续图学习方法，通过神经突触调制器动态调节冻结骨干网络的内部计算流，有效解决了稳定性-可塑性困境和资源密集型预训练问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前持续图学习方法面临两个主要问题：1)稳定性-可塑性困境的平衡问题，重放方法存储成本高；2)资源密集型预训练依赖，主流无重放方法严重依赖预训练骨干网络。

Method: 提出任务感知自适应调制(TAAM)方法，核心是神经突触调制器(NSM)：为每个任务训练并冻结NSM存储专家知识，采用原型引导策略进行知识迁移和推理选择，对冻结GNN骨干进行细粒度节点注意力调制。

Result: 在六个GCIL基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAAM全面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TAAM通过动态调制冻结骨干网络的内部计算流，而非重放数据或微调整个网络，为导航稳定性-可塑性困境开辟了新路径，实现了资源高效的持续图学习。

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的Dempster-Shafer理论属性融合分类器，通过选择性建模策略和新的可能性分布转换方法，显著提升了分类精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DST分类器存在隶属函数建模过于简化以及未能充分利用BPA置信结构的问题，限制了在复杂现实场景中的有效性。

Method: 采用选择性建模策略（单高斯和高斯混合模型），并通过新的方法将可能性分布转换为BPA，同时将置信结构BPA生成方法应用于证据K近邻分类器。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，所提出的分类器优于现有最佳证据分类器，平均准确率提升4.84%，且保持低方差。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统DST分类器的局限性，提供了更丰富灵活的不确定信息表示，显著提升了分类性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在异质图中结合边缘方向性和表达能力强的消息传递对节点分类的影响，提出了两种多项式表达能力强的GNN架构，在异质图基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在异质图中表现不佳，因为其依赖局部同质邻域。先前研究表明建模边缘方向性可以提高有效同质性，同时多项式表达能力强的GNN在捕获高阶特征交互方面显示出潜力。

Method: 提出了两种架构：(1)多项式表达能力强的GAT基线(Poly)，(2)方向感知变体(Dir-Poly)，分别聚合传入和传出边缘。两种模型都学习输入特征上的置换等变高次多项式，同时保持可扩展性。

Result: 在五个异质图基准数据集上，Poly模型始终优于现有基线，Dir-Poly在具有固有方向性的图上(如Roman Empire)提供额外增益，达到最先进结果。在无向图上引入人工方向性并不总是有帮助。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了边缘方向和表达能力强的特征建模在异质图学习中的互补作用，方向性消息传递的益处是情境依赖的。

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ProCause方法，通过集成多种因果推理架构和时序模型，解决了现有RealCause方法在流程挖掘评估中忽略时序依赖性和单一模型限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Prescriptive Process Monitoring评估方法RealCause存在两个主要问题：忽略了流程数据中的时序依赖性，以及仅依赖单一的TARNet因果推理模型架构，限制了评估效果。

Method: 开发了ProCause生成方法，支持序列模型（如LSTM）和非序列模型，并集成了多种因果推理架构（S-Learner、T-Learner、TARNet和集成模型）。

Result: 研究表明TARNet并非总是最佳选择，模型集成提供更一致的可靠性，LSTM在处理时序依赖时能提升评估效果。通过真实数据分析验证了ProCause的实用性。

Conclusion: ProCause为Prescriptive Process Monitoring方法提供了更可靠的评估框架，通过多架构集成和时序建模能力，显著提升了评估的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Result: 在COD-Cluster17基准测试中，简单的回归方法SinkFast显著优于更复杂的流匹配方法

Conclusion: SinkFast方法为分子晶体结构预测提供了更高效准确的解决方案，在保持几何特性的同时显著提升性能

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在高风险领域（如医疗）的部署，模型解释变得至关重要。传统SHAP无法区分因果关系和相关关系，在特征高度相关时会产生误导性的特征重要性归因

Method: 结合Peter-Clark(PC)算法进行因果发现和IDA算法进行因果强度量化，开发了Causal SHAP框架，在保持SHAP优良特性的同时整合因果关系

Result: 通过合成和真实数据集的验证，Causal SHAP降低了仅与目标相关的特征归因分数，提供了更准确的因果感知模型解释

Conclusion: 该研究为可解释AI领域提供了实用的因果感知解释框架，特别在医疗等需要理解真实因果关系的领域具有重要价值

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

Motivation: 传统人才识别方法依赖人工流程、过于关注学术成绩，且通常在高等教育阶段才进行干预，忽视了非学术才能和早期干预机会。

Method: 使用半监督多模态神经网络，整合Transformer、LSTM和ANN架构，基于1041名中学生的离线教育数据，通过聚类奖项记录和提取学习行为特征来预测7种人才类型。

Result: 模型实现了0.908的分类准确率和0.908的ROCAUC，表现出色。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够在学生发展早期有效识别多样化才能，为教育干预提供新途径。

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations methods provide an important tool in the field of
{interpretable machine learning}. Recent advances in this direction have
focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these
techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this
paper, we focus on tabular data typical in finance and the social sciences and
propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an
approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution. Furthermore, we study the
effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and
realistic counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.
The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and

TL;DR: DTRNet是一种改进的Transformer架构，通过动态令牌路由机制，让大多数令牌跳过二次成本的交叉令牌混合，同时保持轻量级线性更新，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在每个层对每个令牌都应用二次自注意力计算，计算成本高昂。需要一种更高效的架构来减少计算开销，同时保持性能。

Method: 提出动态令牌路由网络(DTRNet)，保留MLP模块，将大多数令牌的注意力成本降低到线性。通过路由机制，只有约10%的令牌通过注意力处理，其余令牌接收轻量级线性更新。

Result: DTRNet在保持与完整Transformer相当性能的同时，显著降低了FLOPs。在相同FLOPs下，比MoD和D-LLM等基于路由的层跳过方法在准确性和内存方面表现更好，且效率增益随序列长度增加而提升。

Conclusion: DTRNet通过将令牌更新与注意力混合解耦，大幅减少了二次计算份额，为Transformer提供了简单、高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图神经网络中特征叠加现象，通过控制实验分析GNN潜在空间中多个特征共享方向的问题，发现宽度增加会产生相位模式，拓扑结构影响节点特征重叠，池化操作影响轴对齐和通道共享，为设计更可解释的GNN提供了实用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络难以解释，因为消息传递混合了信号且内部通道很少与人类概念对齐。研究GNN潜在空间中的特征叠加现象，即多个特征共享方向的问题。

Method: 使用具有明确图概念的控制实验，在图形级别提取类条件质心特征，在节点级别提取线性探测方向特征，然后使用简单的基不变诊断分析其几何特性。

Result: 发现：宽度增加产生重叠的相位模式；拓扑结构将重叠印记到节点级特征中；池化部分重新混合成任务对齐的图形轴；更锐利的池化增加轴对齐并减少通道共享；浅层模型可能陷入亚稳态低秩嵌入。

Conclusion: 这些结果将表示几何与具体设计选择（宽度、池化和最终层激活）联系起来，并为设计更可解释的GNN提出了实用方法。

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

TL;DR: SCOUT是一种混合架构，通过分段压缩和稀疏注意力机制，在保持Transformer表达能力的同时显著降低计算和内存成本，在长序列任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的二次注意力复杂度限制了长序列的可扩展性，而线性模型如Mamba和滑动窗口注意力虽然计算高效，但无法保留远距离token的详细信息，导致长序列性能下降。

Method: 提出SCOUT架构：1）使用线性局部混合器（Mamba或SWA）在固定大小段内压缩token并整合近期上下文；2）每个token稀疏关注少量压缩的检查点token来总结输入历史，而非所有先前token。

Result: 在相同计算预算下，SCOUT优于强长序列基线模型；在4亿和13亿参数规模的语言建模和常识推理任务上匹配全注意力Transformer；在长序列基准测试中达到比SOTA模型更高的端到端吞吐量。

Conclusion: SCOUT通过混合压缩和稀疏注意力设计，在保持接近全注意力表达能力的同时实现了次二次方的计算和内存增长，为长序列建模提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

TL;DR: ART是一种自适应重采样训练方法，通过基于类别性能动态调整训练数据分布，有效处理类别不平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重采样方法使用固定分布，忽略了类别学习难度的变化，限制了模型性能。需要一种能够根据模型表现动态调整采样策略的方法

Method: 基于类别宏F1分数定期更新训练数据分布，在类别级别进行自适应调整，逐步将注意力转向表现不佳的类别

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于传统方法，平均提升宏F1分数2.64个百分点，在表格数据上具有统计显著性

Conclusion: ART是一种可靠的不平衡分类方法，能够一致地提供最佳性能，优于现有的重采样和算法级方法

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Motivation: 联邦学习中存在数据异质性导致的模型个性化问题，多任务学习是有效解决方案。然而，将多任务学习扩展到在线去中心化联邦学习还有待探索。同时，实际应用中存在Byzantine客户的问题，但现有方法仅在Byzantine客户数量少于总数一半时有效。需要能够在Byzantine客户占绝对多数时仍保持强固性的方案。

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

Motivation: 现有微调方法参数空间僵化，无法动态激活适当的神经通路来灵活适应多样化和演化的数据分布。

Method: 提出专家混合提示调优(MEPT)框架，集成多个提示专家来自适应学习不同的数据分布，作为有效的流形映射方法。

Result: 在SuperGLUE基准测试中优于多个最先进的参数高效基线方法，平均准确率提升1.94%，同时显著减少79.25%的激活提示。

Conclusion: MEPT通过理论洞察和神经激活通路可视化验证了其有效性，为深度神经网络的流形映射提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is

TL;DR: FlexMDM是一种灵活的掩码扩散模型，能够处理可变长度序列生成，解决了传统MDM只能生成固定长度序列的限制，同时在数学推理和代码填充任务上表现出显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型(MDMs)虽然具有并行推理优势，但无法支持token插入操作，只能生成固定长度的序列，这限制了其在需要可变长度生成任务中的应用。

Method: 基于随机插值框架扩展，FlexMDM通过插入掩码token并逐步去掩码的方式生成序列，支持可变长度序列生成，同时保持任意顺序推理的灵活性。

Result: FlexMDM在困惑度上与MDM相当，但能更好地建模长度统计特性；在迷宫规划任务中成功率提高约60%；将LLaDA-8B微调为FlexMDM后，数学推理(GSM8K)从58%提升到67%，代码填充从52%提升到65%。

Conclusion: FlexMDM成功解决了MDM固定长度生成的限制，提供了灵活的可变长度序列生成能力，同时在多个任务上展现出显著的性能改进，证明了其在离散扩散模型中的重要价值。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

Motivation: 可穿戴传感器的人体活动识别存在跨用户变异性问题，传统监督学习方法容易过拟合到特定用户模式，现有域泛化方法往往忽略时序依赖或需要不切实际的域标签。

Method: TPRL-DG框架将特征提取重新定义为强化学习的序列决策过程，使用基于Transformer的自回归生成器产生捕获用户不变活动动态的时序token，通过多目标奖励函数优化类别区分和跨用户不变性。

Result: 在DSADS和PAMAP2数据集上的评估显示，TPRL-DG在跨用户泛化方面超越了最先进方法，无需每用户校准即可实现优越的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过学习鲁棒的用户不变时序模式，TPRL-DG能够实现可扩展的人体活动识别系统，推动个性化医疗、自适应健身追踪和情境感知环境的发展。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

Conclusion: 融合IMU運動信息的多模態方法能有效提升EEG運動偽影去除效果，為腦機接口的實際應用提供了更可靠的解決方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

Motivation: 概率编程在建模不确定性方面很强大，但小语言模型生成概率程序时经常产生语法和语义错误，如错误的推理结构。受概率程序员领域专业知识和调试策略的启发，需要一种方法来确保生成程序的统计可靠性。

Method: 引入RefineStat框架，强制执行语义约束确保合成程序包含有效分布和良好参数，当可靠性检查失败时应用诊断感知细化，重新采样先验或似然组件。

Result: 在多个概率编程代码生成任务上评估，RefineStat使用小语言模型生成的程序既语法正确又统计可靠，性能通常匹配或超过闭源大语言模型（如OpenAI o3）。

Conclusion: RefineStat通过约束强制执行和细化策略，有效解决了小语言模型在概率编程中的错误问题，提供了一种可靠的概率程序生成方法。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

Conclusion: CCE是一个综合性能优异的时间序列异常检测评估指标，配合RankEval基准能够客观比较不同指标的优劣，两个工具均已开源。

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Conclusion: SC-GIR框架能有效学习紧凑且信息丰富的潜在表示，为目标导向的语义通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 自适应深度消息传递是提升GNN性能的有效方法，适用于所有遵循消息传递方案的模型

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node
classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN
models.

Conclusion: StoxLSTM通过将随机潜在变量集成到xLSTM中，成功提升了模型对复杂时间模式和依赖关系的捕获能力，在时间序列预测任务中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

*Eddi Weinwurm,Alexander Kovalenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了关系保持损失(RPL)方法，通过最小化高维数据和低维嵌入之间关系矩阵的差异，来保持向量空间的正交性和线性独立性等关键属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降维过程会扭曲向量空间的关键属性（如正交性和线性独立性），这些属性对于跨模态检索、聚类和分类等任务至关重要。需要一种方法来在降维过程中保持这些几何关系。

Method: 使用关系保持损失(RPL)函数，通过比较高维数据和低维嵌入的关系矩阵（如Gram矩阵或余弦相似度矩阵）的差异来训练神经网络进行非线性投影。该方法基于矩阵扰动理论推导了误差边界。

Result: 初步实验表明，RPL能够在减少嵌入维度的同时，在很大程度上保持下游任务的性能，这得益于其对关键向量空间属性的保持。

Conclusion: RPL不仅适用于降维任务，还可广泛应用于跨域对齐和迁移学习、知识蒸馏、公平性和不变性、去中心化、图和流形学习以及联邦学习等领域，确保分布式嵌入保持几何一致性。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解学习的物理机制提供了新视角，能够将新信息整合到现有知识结构中，促进生物与人工智能系统的对齐

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN表达能力理论存在两个主要问题：1）大多数实际任务并不需要超越WL测试的表达能力；2）表达能力理论的二元分类和理想化假设无法反映GNN的实际能力

Method: 提出Message Passing Complexity (MPC)这一连续度量方法，量化GNN架构通过消息传递解决给定任务的难度，同时捕捉过压缩等实际限制

Result: 在基础GNN任务上的广泛验证表明，MPC的理论预测与实证性能相关，成功解释了架构的成功与失败

Conclusion: MPC超越了表达能力理论，为理解和改进GNN架构提供了更强大和细致入微的框架

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

Motivation: 边缘计算系统中，自主智能体需要在共享资源竞争环境下快速做出本地决策。现有MARL方法依赖集中式评论家或频繁通信，在有限观测性和通信约束下失效。

Method: 每个智能体解决约束马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)，通过共享约束向量进行隐式协调。约束防止共享服务器资源过载，约束更新频率低，作为轻量级协调机制。使用安全强化学习确保策略满足本地和全局目标。

Result: 在理论保证下验证了方法的有效性，实验显示在大规模设置中优于集中式和独立基线方法，性能得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 该去中心化框架通过共享约束向量实现了有效的隐式协调，在有限通信条件下解决了多智能体资源竞争问题，特别适合大规模边缘计算场景。

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Motivation: LLMs在需要组合规则和处理分布外示例的系统性泛化任务中面临显著挑战，特别是在数学推理任务中表现有限。

Method: 采用迭代示例选择策略，逐步构建针对特定任务优化的少样本示例集，并结合显式推理指令进行提示。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在代数表达式简化任务中表现有限，但通过该方法可以显著提升泛化性能，且简单示例比复杂示例效果更好。

Conclusion: 迭代示例选择策略能有效提升LLMs的系统性泛化能力，特别是在数学推理任务中，简单示例比复杂示例更有利于模型泛化。

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

Conclusion: 该方法改进了现有技术水平，为在复杂仿真器上应用替代辅助的强化学习策略优化铺平了道路。

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高且缺乏灵活性，现有神经算子架构难以捕捉多尺度行为并忽略物理对称性，需要开发更高效的替代方法。

Method: 采用等变U形神经算子架构，结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率U形结构，通过调节平移等变性来符合底层物理规律，从短历史动态中学习相场演化。

Result: E-UNO在精细尺度和高频结构上优于标准傅里叶神经算子和U形神经算子基线，具有更好的泛化能力、更少的训练数据需求和物理一致的动力学预测。

Conclusion: E-UNO作为复杂相场系统的高效替代模型，通过编码对称性和尺度层次结构，为材料科学和软物质中的界面动力学提供了有效的计算工具。

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生命体征预测中应用受限，主要原因是缺乏可靠的不确定性量化，临床医生无法判断预测异常是真实警告还是模型噪声，影响临床决策。

Method: 1) 参数化方法：假设预测误差和不确定性估计服从高斯copula分布，实现闭式PI计算；2) 非参数方法：基于K近邻算法，使用相似验证实例经验估计条件误差分布。

Result: 在两个大型公共数据集上验证，高斯copula方法在低频数据上持续优于共形预测基准，KNN方法在高频数据上表现最佳。

Conclusion: RUE衍生的预测区间具有临床前景，能够提供可解释的、考虑不确定性的生命体征预测，有助于提升临床决策的可信度。

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Motivation: 工业级电池管理涉及多种任务，每种任务使用不同时间尺度、传感器分辨率和数据通道的数据。构建特定任务方法需要大量数据和工程努力，限制了智能电池管理的可扩展性。

Method: 开发灵活的掩码自编码器(FMAE)预训练框架，能够学习缺失电池数据通道的统一表示，捕捉数据片段间的相互关联，并适用于不同任务。

Result: FMAE在5个电池管理任务和11个电池数据集上始终优于所有特定任务方法。在剩余寿命预测任务中，使用50倍少的推理数据仍保持最先进结果。即使真实数据缺乏某些信息(如系统电压)，FMAE仍能应用且性能影响很小。

Conclusion: FMAE展示了一条实现灵活、数据高效模型的实用途径，简化了动态系统的现实世界多任务管理。

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 基于重正化理论的优化框架为局部优化器提供了理论基础的全局指导，克服了传统启发式自适应方法的局限性

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二次无约束二进制优化（QUBO）的先进暴雨（AT）损失函数，用于改进机器学习降水预报模型，解决传统关键成功指数（CSI）在干旱期失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降水预报方法依赖的CSI损失函数在长期干旱期（降水量低于阈值时）会失效，需要开发更有效的优化标准来提高机器学习降水预报的准确性。

Method: 引入简单惩罚表达式并将其重新解释为QUBO公式，通过近似过程将QUBO公式松弛为可微分的AT损失函数。

Result: 通过Lipschitz常数、预报性能评估、一致性实验和业务模型消融研究证明了AT损失函数的优越性。

Conclusion: 所提出的AT损失函数有效解决了CSI在干旱期的局限性，显著提升了降水预报的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测方法可能受混淆变量影响，需要识别真正具有因果关系的特征来提升预测准确性和可解释性

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)进行因果影响分析，通过干预操作识别因果敏感特征，通过反事实分析评估因果效应

Conclusion: 该方法成功将因果推理与生成预测结合，通过识别因果敏感特征减少混淆偏差，在时空轨迹预测等任务中表现优异

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

TL;DR: 提出了DPF-CM框架，专注于中文医疗大语言模型训练数据处理的完整解决方案，包括训练数据处理和部署隐私保护两大核心模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源的中文医疗语言模型训练流程主要关注训练方法优化，但缺乏对训练数据处理的全面探索，存在指令内容不足和隐私风险等问题。

Method: 包含两个核心模块：(1) 训练数据处理管道，采用链式示例上下文学习策略生成问题导向指令，以及基于集成奖励模型的偏好数据筛选机制；(2) 部署隐私保护模块，通过隐私保护向量数据库(PPVD)方法，包括模型记忆搜索、高风险数据库构建、安全数据库构建和匹配替换四个阶段。

Result: 实验结果显示DPF-CM显著提升模型准确性，使训练的中文医疗LLM在开源模型中达到最先进性能，同时将训练数据隐私泄露减少27%。

Conclusion: DPF-CM框架为中文医疗大语言模型提供了全面的数据处理解决方案，在提升模型性能的同时有效解决了隐私保护问题。

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Motivation: 解决纳米结构逆问题，理解纳米材料性质与结构之间的关系，将PDF数据恢复纳米结构视为条件生成问题。

Method: 基于潜在扩散模型，通过条件先验估计条件后验分布p(z|x)来减少扩散模型采样步骤，提高样本生成效率；使用拉普拉斯矩阵替代距离矩阵来恢复纳米结构。

Result: CbLDM相比现有模型在纳米结构逆问题上表现出显著更高的预测精度。

Conclusion: CbLDM能够有效解决纳米结构逆问题，并具有处理其他连续条件生成任务的潜力。

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Motivation: 消息传递架构在节点和图预测任务中难以充分建模长距离依赖关系

Method: 利用层次图结构和自适应随机游走，引入可学习的转移概率来决定游走是偏好原始图还是跨越层次捷径

Result: 在合成长距离任务中，该方法能够超越仅基于原始拓扑的传统方法的理论限制，偏好层次结构的游走可以达到与原始图上更长游走相同的性能

Conclusion: 这些初步发现为高效处理大型图并有效捕获长距离依赖开辟了有前景的方向

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE等离散隐空间深度生成模型虽然生成能力强大，但因隐空间过大导致概率推理不可处理，需要找到一种方法解决这个问题

Method: 采用简单的策略：选择概率较高的隐变量子集，将VQ-VAE精炼为概率电路模型，利用VQ-VAE隐空间常常被低效利用的特性

Result: 实验结果显示在密度估计和条件生成任务中具有竞争性能力，挑战了VQ-VAE作为本质上不可处理模型的观点

Conclusion: 证明了VQ-VAE可以通过简单的精炼方法转换为可处理模型，在保持表达能力的同时实现概率推理的可处理性，为离散隐空间生成模型的应用开启了新可能

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了基于实例的成本敏感分类器在信贷评分中对模型解释稳定性的影响，发现虽然成本效率提升，但解释稳定性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着监管对可解释性要求的提高，需要研究基于实例的成本敏感分类器对模型解释稳定性的影响，这在现有文献中尚未探索。

Method: 使用四个公开信贷评分数据集，首先评估IDCS分类器的医视力和成本效率，提出新的跨数据集可比性指标，然后通过控制重采样研究不同类别不平衡程度下SHAP和LIME特征重要性排名的稳定性。

Result: 结果显示IDCS分类器虽然提高了成本效率，但产生的解释显著不如传统模型稳定，特别是随着类别不平衡的加剧而更加显著。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了信贷评分中成本优化与可解释性之间的关键交换，告警需要解决IDCS分类器的稳定性问题，以确保其成本优势不会因不稳定或不可信的解释而受到影响。

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器在大规模参数研究和设计优化中存在计算开销大的瓶颈，神经算子存在外推局限性，需要一种既能加速求解又能保持物理约束的方法。

Method: 将参数偏差残差作为附加源项，利用任意训练好的神经算子离线精化解，将神经算子预测嵌入迭代PDE求解器作为改进的初始猜测，减少收敛迭代次数。

Result: 在单组常数参数上训练的神经算子成功加速了具有异质、正弦和不连续参数分布的求解，计算时间减少约50%，同时保持全阶保真度。

Conclusion: MD-PNOP框架有效解决了神经算子的外推限制，实现了无需重新训练的广泛参数配置泛化，在保持物理约束的同时显著加速了PDE求解过程。

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: Reward maximization, safe exploration, and intrinsic motivation are often
studied as separate objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). We present a
unified geometric framework, that views these goals as instances of a single
optimization problem on the space of achievable long-term behavior in an

descent, natural policy gradient, and trust-region algorithms naturally
generalize to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. We illustrate how
this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity
objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

Conclusion: 该方法能够利用外部文本知识来显著提高运动描述的准确性，尤其在现有数据集未覆盖的运动上表现优异

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

Conclusion: PAFlow通过创新的交互指导和原子数预测机制，显著提高了基于结构药物设计的生成质量和结合亲和力，为新型药物发现提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

Conclusion: 该方法在解决ECG异常检测中的类别不平衡和存储限制问题方面表现出良好前景

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

Conclusion: FoRo为预训练模型的持续学习提供了有前景的方向，特别适用于效率和效果都至关重要的实际多媒体应用场景

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现图对比学习(GCL)的优势高度依赖于数据集大小和任务难度，在标准数据集上，未经训练的图神经网络、简单多层感知机甚至手工统计特征都能与GCL媲美或超越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑GCL是否真的优于未经训练的基线方法，探究GCL性能优势的真实边界条件。

Method: 通过在标准数据集、大型分子数据集ogbg-molhiv和合成数据集上进行系统性实验，比较GCL与未经训练的GNN、MLP和手工统计特征的性能表现。

Result: GCL的优势随数据集规模增大而显现，在ogbg-molhiv数据集上，小规模时落后但超过几千个图后开始领先；在合成数据集上，GCL准确率随图数量对数增长，性能差距随任务复杂度变化。

Conclusion: 需要重视数据集规模在基准测试中的作用，并设计能够避免性能平台效应的GCL算法。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次将Feynman-Kac引导方法扩展到条件流匹配(CFM)模型，用于精确控制生成样本的分布特性，并在高维倾斜分布生成和化学反应过渡态生成等挑战性任务中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然条件流匹配(CFM)在生成建模中表现出色，但现有引导方法如梯度引导、序列蒙特卡洛等主要针对扩散模型，尚未扩展到流匹配方法。需要开发能够精确控制CFM生成样本特性的引导技术。

Method: 提出将精确控制要求表述为能量势倾斜输出，首次推导出适用于CFM的Feynman-Kac引导方法。该方法通过能量势函数来引导生成过程，实现对输出分布的精确控制。

Result: 在合成任务上验证了方法有效性，特别是在高维空间倾斜分布生成这一对引导方法极具挑战性的任务中表现优异。成功解决了化学反应过渡态生成中手性正确性的难题，能够生成满足几何约束的可行反应路径。

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac引导的CFM方法为精确控制生成样本提供了有效解决方案，在高维空间分布控制和化学反应过渡态生成等复杂任务中展现出强大能力，填补了流匹配方法在精确引导方面的空白。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MergeLock是一种主动保护机制，通过扰乱模型参数使其无法被合并，从而防止未经授权的模型合并。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着微调模型的公开可用性增加，模型合并的安全性受到关注，现有方法只能检测合并来源但无法有效防止非法合并。

Method: 利用Transformer注意力机制的对称性，随机采样两对可逆矩阵并应用到QK和VO分支，保持模型输出不变但使其远离其他微调模型的共享参数空间。

Result: 实验表明MergeLock在大多数情况下能将涉及受保护模型的合并模型性能降低95%以上，且无法通过低成本恢复方法有效恢复。

Conclusion: MergeLock提供了一种有效的主动保护机制，能直接防止未经授权的模型合并，增强模型安全性。

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is
available at https://github.com/hetailang/Merge-Lock.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AddIPW估计器的干扰感知提升建模方法，通过可微分学习目标直接优化经济收益，在存在干扰效应的推荐系统中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提升建模方法忽略了推荐系统中的干扰效应（一个商品的促销会影响其他商品的转化），违反了SUTVA假设，导致实际市场中的策略次优。现有干扰感知估计器尚未应用于提升建模领域。

Method: 使用Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW)估计器作为可微分学习目标，结合梯度优化方法，并与响应变换技术集成，直接优化增量利润等经济指标。

Result: 模拟实验显示该方法显著优于忽略干扰的传统方法，特别是在干扰效应增强时表现更优。利润导向的提升策略在该框架下能更有效地识别高影响力干预措施。

Conclusion: 该方法为激励个性化提供了实用的干扰感知优化路径，能够实现更有利可图的推荐系统促销策略。

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动和可穿戴传感技术能够连续监测情感状态，但结合生态自我报告问卷时面临数据缺失和不规则时间间隔的挑战，需要有效的时间依赖建模方法

Method: 开发Ema2Vec时间嵌入方法，专门设计用于处理不规则间隔的自我报告序列，捕捉时间依赖性

Result: Ema2Vec在纵向压力预测任务中表现优于依赖固定大小时间窗口的基线方法，以及没有时间感知表示的纵向序列模型

Conclusion: 在处理不规则采样的纵向数据时，纳入时间嵌入对于准确建模人类状态和行为预测至关重要

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OCFL的一次性聚类联邦学习算法，能够自动检测最佳聚类时机，无需调整超参数即可实现个性化模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的聚类联邦学习(CFL)领域仍未被充分探索，现有方法在基本假设和设置上与标准FL有所不同，需要一种自动化的聚类时机检测方法。

Method: 基于计算客户端梯度间的余弦距离和温度测量来检测联邦模型开始收敛的时刻，采用与聚类无关的算法自动确定最佳聚类时机。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的40多个任务测试表明，该方法性能良好，验证了基于密度的聚类方法在区分不同分布神经网络损失曲面方面的高效性。

Conclusion: OCFL算法能够自动化地进行CFL，无需超参数调整，同时通过GradCAM局部解释性分析揭示了个性化与局部预测可解释性之间的关系。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

Motivation: 大数据时代移动设备产生海量人类移动数据，但数据复杂性阻碍模型训练效率，且单纯预测下一个位置忽略了距离和方向等隐含决定因素，导致预测结果不理想

Conclusion: 该统一训练框架有效解决了人类移动预测中的训练效率和预测精度问题，通过课程学习和多任务学习的结合显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度因果发现方法虽然高效可扩展，但对数据分布偏差敏感，需要研究这些偏差的影响和控制方法

Method: 使用狄利克雷先验的双变量分类设置，构建学习边际或条件分布的简单模型来分析偏差影响，并通过消除因果分解竞争来增强鲁棒性

Result: 证明了梯度因果发现方法对边际分布不对称性和边际分布偏移不对称性两种偏差敏感，但通过控制竞争可以使其对这些偏差具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 梯度因果发现方法需要关注数据分布偏差问题，通过适当的设计可以增强其对分布偏差的鲁棒性

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分布式轨迹优化方法ADMM-DDP需要大量调参来平衡局部任务性能和全局协调，参数耦合紧密且调优困难，限制了其在多样化任务和配置中的适用性。

Conclusion: L2C提供了一个通用的元学习框架，能够自适应调整分布式优化算法的超参数，显著提高了多智能体系统在复杂任务中的协调性能和计算效率，具有强大的适应性和实用性。

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该研究将RTB置于更广泛的KL正则化强化学习理论框架中，阐明了其与早期方法的关系，并证明KL正则化RL方法可以作为RTB的有效替代方案，为序列生成模型的微调提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

Conclusion: 研究为预训练设计选择提供了见解，有助于实践者在蒸馏预训练中做出更明智的决策，平衡测试时缩放和上下文学习能力的权衡。

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习和精心设计的奖励机制，较小模型可以超越静态大模型，为构建可学习的智能代理提供了新方向

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

Result: 集成池化多模态模型取得了最佳性能，ROC-AUC达到92%，证明了其在现实应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到其他应用，如提高汽车安全性（与安全气囊系统集成）和辅助自动驾驶车辆的碰撞检测。

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Conclusion: SoLS通过智能区分正负样本的更新策略，有效解决了基础模型强化学习中的关键问题，为移动界面导航等任务提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的CMMN方法扩展，通过两种替代方法计算源参考频谱，改善了EEG信号的光谱一致性，显著提高了独立成分分类中识别大脑与非大脑成分的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG记录包含丰富的神经活动信息，但受到伪影、噪声以及传感器、放大器和滤波器导致的表面差异的影响。现有的独立成分分析和自动标记方法需要改进以适应不同数据集间的差异。

Method: 提出了CMMN方法的两种扩展：(1)通道平均和l1归一化重心方法；(2)主体到主体映射方法，寻找与目标主体频谱最接近的源主体。这些方法产生时空可分离滤波器，可用于不同通道数的数据集映射。

Result: 在独立成分分类任务中应用这些滤波器，显示在识别大脑与非大脑独立成分方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过适当的光谱归一化滤波可以最小化记录设备和环境差异对机器学习模型性能的影响，该方法对癫痫和精神疾病等神经病理学的EEG诊断和监测具有临床意义。

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器学习偏见缓解技术存在"平均下降效应"，即改善弱势群体结果会导致优势群体性能下降。需要找到一种方法能够同时维护公平性和效果性。

Method: 提出Bias Mitigation through Continual Learning (BM-CL)框架，将偏见缓解重新解释为持续学习问题。借鉴Learning without Forgetting和Elastic Weight Consolidation等技术，让模型能够在调整公平性条件的同时保持对优势群体有益的知识。

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上进行实验，证明该框架能够有效缓解各种来源的偏见，同时最小化原始知识的丢失。

Conclusion: BM-CL框架成功将公平性和持续学习两个领域结合起来，为开发既公平又高效的机器学习系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Conclusion: 提出的高效联邦LLM蒸馏方案成功解决了通信开销和异构模型适应性问题，为隐私保护的LLM协作训练提供了可行方案

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

Result: 创建了一个能够严格评估RL方法在不同形式不确定性下表现的基准测试平台

Conclusion: STORI基准和随机性分类法填补了现有研究的空白，为系统评估RL方法在随机环境中的性能提供了重要工具

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

Conclusion: MBT-CB的优越性能表明其在改善心血管生物标志物预测和支持疫情期间临床决策方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

Motivation: 现有Conformal Prediction方法面临数据效率低（SCP）或计算复杂度高（FCP）的问题，需要一种既能保持覆盖率保证又高效的方法。

Method: 使用排列不变的Transformer-based ICL模型，采用CP感知损失函数进行训练，模拟FCP的多重训练模型而不实际进行重训练。

Result: 在合成和真实任务上的实验表明，E-ICL+FCP相比现有SCP和FCP基线方法，获得了更好的效率-覆盖率权衡。

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP框架有效解决了传统CP方法的数据效率和计算复杂度问题，为可靠的不确定性量化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

Motivation: 传统早停方法需要监控全局验证损失并同时停止所有参数更新，对于大型transformer来说验证推理计算成本高昂，且不同组件收敛速度不同

Method: 在训练过程中跟踪注意力投影和Feed-Forward层矩阵的反向传播梯度幅度，当某个投影矩阵的梯度低于收敛阈值τ时，单独排除该矩阵的更新，允许收敛慢的矩阵继续学习

Result: 训练时间加速1.57-7.22倍，平均准确率提升1.2%，通过早期防止过拟合来增强泛化能力

Conclusion: GradES通过组件级别的梯度监控实现了高效早停，既大幅减少了计算成本，又改善了模型性能

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了计算效率和求解质量，特别适用于时间紧迫的灾害响应应用，为快速决策拯救生命提供了有效工具

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

*Raunak Kunwar,Aera Kim LeBoulluec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究使用机器学习分析NCAP安全评级数据，发现车辆基本特征（车重和车型年份）对预测5星安全评级最重要，但ADAS功能也有显著贡献，随机森林模型达到89.18%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NCAP安全评级从传统被动安全扩展到包含ADAS主动安全技术，需要实证研究这些系统如何相互作用，以及它们与车辆基本特征共同预测最高安全评级的能力。

Method: 使用包含5,128辆车型的NCAP公开数据集，比较逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升和SVC四种机器学习模型，采用5折分层交叉验证，并对最佳模型进行超参数优化。

Result: 车辆基本特征（车重和车型年份）贡献了超过55%的特征重要性，但ADAS功能也有意义。优化后的随机森林模型在测试集上达到89.18%准确率和0.9586 ROC AUC。

Conclusion: 机器学习能有效分析大规模NCAP数据，传统车辆参数和现代ADAS特征共同对获得顶级安全评级具有重要预测价值。

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

### [395] [VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection for Adaptive Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01903)
*Tanvir Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VISP是一种基于梯度波动性的自适应正则化方法，通过动态计算梯度统计量来调整随机投影矩阵的噪声注入，选择性地正则化高波动性节点，提升深度学习模型的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法如均匀噪声注入或固定dropout率无法适应不同节点的训练动态，需要一种能够根据梯度波动性自适应调整正则化强度的机制。

Method: VISP通过计算梯度统计量来度量波动性，并利用该信息动态缩放随机投影矩阵，对梯度波动性较高的输入和隐藏节点进行选择性正则化，同时保持稳定表示。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，VISP相比基线模型和固定噪声方法能持续提升泛化性能，同时稳定网络内部动态并促进更鲁棒的特征表示。

Conclusion: VISP通过基于梯度波动性的自适应正则化机制，有效缓解过拟合问题，为深度学习模型提供了一种更智能的正则化策略。

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

TL;DR: GraCE-VAE是一个针对非i.i.d.数据的因果解缠框架，利用图神经网络和结构化上下文信息来恢复潜在因果图和干预效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果解缠方法主要针对i.i.d.数据，但在现实世界中存在大量结构化上下文信息（如网络数据），需要开发能够利用这些信息的非i.i.d.因果解缠方法

Method: 结合差异变分自编码器和图神经网络，在结构化上下文信息下联合恢复真实潜在因果图和干预效果

Result: 理论证明i.i.d.数据的可识别性结果在本框架中仍然成立，在三个基因扰动数据集上的实验表明利用结构化上下文能显著提升因果解缠性能

Conclusion: GraCE-VAE成功将因果解缠扩展到非i.i.d.设置，证明了利用结构化上下文信息的重要性，为复杂现实场景中的因果发现提供了有效工具

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both
observational and interventional data. Previous research has looked into this
problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应Co-Kriging辅助的多保真度多目标神经架构搜索算法，通过聚类局部采样策略和连续编码方法，显著降低计算成本并提升搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经架构搜索(NAS)虽然能自动优化架构设计，但计算成本高昂，特别是在优化多个冲突目标时。需要一种更高效的方法来减少计算负担。

Method: 采用自适应Co-Kriging辅助的多保真度多目标NAS算法，结合聚类局部采样策略和新型连续编码方法，降低搜索维度。

Result: 在有限计算预算下，该算法在三个数值基准、2D Darcy流回归问题和CHASE_DB1生物医学图像分割问题上优于现有最先进方法。成功应用于城市建模中的风速回归模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了NAS的计算成本，并独立发现了U-Net架构的优越设计原则，如允许每个单元整合先前单元信息的重要性。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程模型具有物理真实性但计算成本高且结构僵化，机器学习方法高效灵活但缺乏可解释性和迁移性，需要统一框架来整合两者的优势

Method: 三阶段知识蒸馏：1)行为蒸馏-通过代理学习和模型简化增强过程模型；2)结构蒸馏-将过程方程重构为图神经网络中的模块化组件；3)认知蒸馏-使用Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth架构将专家推理嵌入智能建模代理

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代智能生态水文建模系统提供了可扩展和可迁移的途径，并具有扩展到其他过程建模领域的潜力

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

Motivation: 挑战互补学习系统理论中语义记忆与片段记忆的二分法，探索新皮层在预测编码框架下的片段记忆能力及其与语义记忆的关系

Method: 构建基于预测编码的新皮层神经网络模型，测试其在少量和大量样本训练条件下的记忆表现

Conclusion: 新皮层使用密集重叠表征只能编码有限数量的具体示例，证明了海马体稀疏模式分离表征的必要性，片段记忆可以从语义学习中产生

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯推断中后验分布通常难以解析求解，需要采样方法近似。传统HMC和MCMC方法存在参数设置复杂的问题，而BPS虽然参数设置更简单，但在多模态分布上收敛较慢。

Result: 通过数值模拟验证了该方法在多模态分布上的有效性，证明了其加速收敛到后验分布的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的BPS-PT算法能够有效处理多模态分布问题，相比传统方法具有参数设置更简单、收敛更快的优势。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种维度感知的遗传编程算法，通过维度修复程序来演化具有维度一致性的医疗预约规则，在保持结构完整性的同时提升规则性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遗传编程演化的预约规则缺乏维度一致性，导致规则难以被医疗从业者理解和信任，需要一种能够保持维度一致性的演化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够探索更广泛的规则结构，通过临时打破维度一致性再修复的方式，发现具有更大潜力的个体，为设计更有效和可解释的预约规则提供了新思路。

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过系统性实验发现，先前关于优化器性能的对比存在方法学缺陷，矩阵预条件优化器（如Muon、Soap）相比AdamW的实际加速比随模型规模增大而显著降低，从0.1B参数的1.4倍降至1.2B参数的仅1.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型预训练中优化器对比的两个方法学缺陷：不平等的超参数调优和有限/误导性的评估设置，以提供公平的优化器性能比较。

Method: 对10种深度学习优化器进行系统性研究，涵盖4个模型规模（0.1B-1.2B参数）和数据-模型比例（1-8倍Chinchilla最优值），采用严格的超参数调优和训练结束时的全面评估。

Result: 发现矩阵预条件优化器（Muon、Soap等）相比AdamW的加速效果随模型规模增大而显著减弱，从0.1B参数的1.4倍加速降至1.2B参数的仅1.1倍加速。

Conclusion: 优化器性能对比需要严格的超参数调优和全面的评估，矩阵预条件优化器在大规模模型上的实际优势有限，AdamW在大模型训练中仍然具有竞争力。

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的双层优化框架，通过上层任务关注数据效用、下层任务关注数据隐私，在数据扰动中实现隐私保护与数据效用的协同平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习训练需要数据集，但直接共享原始数据存在成员推理攻击等隐私风险。现有隐私保护技术往往降低数据准确性、特异性和多样性，影响下游任务性能，因此需要在隐私保护和数据效用之间找到最优平衡。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：上层任务通过判别器指导生成过程，确保扰动后的潜在变量映射到高质量样本；下层任务利用数据流形上的局部外在曲率作为个体对MIA脆弱性的量化指标，通过向低曲率区域扰动样本来抑制易受攻击的独特特征组合。

Result: 广泛的实验评估表明，该方法不仅增强了下游任务对MIA的抵抗能力，而且在样本质量和多样性方面超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 该双层优化框架成功实现了隐私保护与数据效用的协同平衡，为私有数据集发布提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够捕捉大气垂直结构、响应气候变化强迫，同时保持计算效率和长期稳定性的三维气候模拟器，以支持快速实验和耦合气候动力学研究。

Method: 基于原始LUCIE-2D框架，采用球形傅里叶神经算子(SFNO)主干网络，使用30年ERA5再分析数据在8个垂直σ层上进行训练，整合CO2作为强迫变量，可选整合海表温度(SST)模拟海气耦合动力学。

Conclusion: LUCIE-3D结合了稳定性、物理一致性和可访问性，是快速实验、消融研究和耦合气候动力学探索的宝贵工具，在古气候研究和未来地球系统模拟方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了数据依赖的变异性，而蛋白质数据分布稀疏且不均匀，小部分样本位于密集簇中，大部分样本分布在数据空间的不同稀疏区域。

Method: 使用核密度估计(KDE)作为预处理步骤来估计每个数据点的噪声尺度σ，然后使用这些数据依赖的σ值训练评分模型，将局部数据几何融入去噪过程。

Conclusion: 在稀疏高维设置中，数据感知的sigma预测对于生成建模具有重要意义。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

Conclusion: CIML框架成功突破了传统多视图冗余假设的限制，充分利用了共同和独特信息的预测能力，在多视图学习中取得了优异性能

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Motivation: 多任务学习中，随着任务数量增加，任务干扰问题日益严重，现有模型融合方法在处理多个任务时性能下降。需要一种能够自动平衡任务重要性、无需额外标注数据的鲁棒融合方法。

Method: 利用Jensen-Shannon散度指导模型融合过程，自动平衡不同任务的重要性，无需额外标注数据。该方法通过数学优化实现多模型的有效合并。

Result: 该方法在任务数量增加时保持鲁棒性， consistently outperforms prior work，在所有任务上都保持了强劲的性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的基于Jensen-Shannon散度的模型融合方法有效解决了多任务学习中的任务干扰问题，为大规模多任务模型融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single
level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between
high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset
for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)
nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust
detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a
foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly
available at https://higraph.org.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with
the highest reward. This paper explores a threshold-based bandit problem,
aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau
\). We study variants where the optimal arm is the first above \(\tau\), the
\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit
theory with threshold constraints for efficient decision-making.

Motivation: 现有的视觉地点识别(VPR)方法，包括视觉基础模型和多模态大语言模型，虽然提升了语义理解能力，但存在计算开销大和跨域转移性差的问题。

Conclusion: 该框架通过消除两阶段处理和实时适应能力，在不增加训练成本的情况下实现了跨域VPR性能的显著提升和计算效率的巨大改善。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$
computational efficiency gains.

Conclusion: 该方法在贝叶斯意义下是最优的，能够产生有效的干预，为实现网络和系统管理任务的自动化提供了重要技术支撑

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Conditional-$t^3$VAE模型，通过每类Student's t联合先验和γ-散度优化，解决VAE在类别不平衡数据上生成公平性问题，在严重不平衡场景下显著提升生成质量和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE及其变体$t^3$VAE在类别不平衡数据集上，潜在空间分配与类别频率成正比，导致尾部类别表示不足，生成公平性降低。

Method: 提出Conditional-$t^3$VAE，为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验分布，使用γ-散度推导闭式优化目标，并推导等权重潜在混合Student's t分布用于类别平衡生成。

Result: 在SVHN-LT、CIFAR100-LT和CelebA数据集上，Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings.

Conclusion: 在轻度不平衡（ρ≲3）时高斯模型仍有竞争力，但在更极端的不平衡场景下，Conditional-$t^3$VAE显著提升了生成公平性和多样性。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

Motivation: 预测-优化方法假设更准确的预测会产生更接近最优解的方案，但在复杂约束优化问题中验证这一假设具有挑战性，现有文献往往忽视这一点。

Method: 开发了模拟多分类器预测的新算法，补充现有的二分类模拟算法，通过计算研究评估算法性能，并将其应用于机器调度问题的预测-优化算法评估。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了基于机器学习预测的决策系统设计和评估的重要考虑因素，预测误差与解决方案质量的关系复杂，不能简单假设更准确的预测必然产生更好的优化结果。

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

Conclusion: DaCe AD提供了通用高效的自动微分解决方案，解决了现有AD框架的主要局限性，特别适用于科学计算和机器学习集成应用

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

Conclusion: 强大的动态验证系统对于将大模型能力与实际临床应用对齐至关重要，为医疗AI部署建立了新的性能-参数权衡帕累托前沿。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习中概率预测的普及，如何解释和评估预测概率的可靠性成为重要问题，需要系统研究校准的理论基础和实践应用。

Method: 采用统一视角，将校准视为预测器假设世界与真实世界（由自然或贝叶斯最优预测器控制）之间的不可区分性，分析不同校准度量方法如何量化这种不可区分程度。

Result: 建立了校准作为不可区分性的理论框架，阐明了各种校准度量方法对应于不同类别的区分器或统计度量，为评估预测概率的可靠性提供了系统方法。

Conclusion: 校准理论为概率预测的评估提供了重要理论基础，不可区分性视角统一了不同校准度量方法，对下游决策者使用预测结果具有重要意义。

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

*Shijie Wang,Li Zhang,Xinyan Liang,Yuhua Qian,Shen Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出UDI方法解决多模态学习中模态不平衡问题，通过单向动态交互替代传统联合损失，实现更好的模态协同和性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态联合学习会导致模态不平衡，强势模态压制弱势模态，限制了单个模态信息和模态间交互信息的充分利用

Method: UDI方法：先训练锚定模态至收敛，然后用其学习表示通过无监督损失指导其他模态，动态调整模态交互以适应任务需求

Result: 实验结果表明UDI在处理模态不平衡方面优于现有方法，在多模态学习任务中实现了性能改进

Conclusion: UDI通过解耦模态优化和启用定向信息流，有效防止单一模态主导，促进跨模态特征学习，为多模态不平衡学习提供了新策略

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

Motivation: 解决在线决策问题中机器学习预测准确性无法保证的挑战，需要在预测准确时获得更好性能，预测不准确时仍保持稳健性。

Method: 引入有界影响框架，限制过去决策对未来最优奖励的影响，提出AdaSwitch元算法在不同预测质量下自适应切换策略。

Result: AdaSwitch算法在预测准确时性能接近离线最优，预测不准确时仍保持经典竞争比保证，适用于多种在线决策场景。

Conclusion: 该框架和元算法具有灵活性和广泛适用性，为学习增强的在线决策提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

Motivation: 现实文本分类任务中经常遇到类别不平衡问题，传统过采样方法在处理文本数据时面临特征空间扩展的独特挑战，需要专门针对文本特性的解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的马尔可夫链文本过采样方法能有效处理文本数据的不平衡问题，通过结合多数类信息扩展特征空间，在严重不平衡场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率时间序列预测方法存在分布建模不理想以及训练与评估指标不匹配的问题，需要更优的不确定性感知预测方案。

Method: 提出RDIT框架：增强强点估计器，添加零均值高斯分布（标准差匹配训练误差），结合点估计和基于残差的条件扩散，采用双向Mamba网络。理论证明CRPS可通过调整到最优标准差来最小化，并推导分布匹配算法。

Conclusion: RDIT框架通过创新的方法解决了概率时间序列预测中的关键问题，在多个指标上表现出色，为不确定性感知预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的成功依赖于参与者不可见的行为，需要从规则和激励的战略角度分析，而不仅仅是优化视角。

Method: 引入两个指标分别量化行为激励和集体性能损失，建立分析框架，提供检查表、审计资源分配算法和性能保证。

Conclusion: 通过周期性重新校准、随机化和基于连接的警报，可以在现实操作变异性下实现稳健应用，降低指标博弈激励同时维持稳定合作。

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计数据集复杂性对于评估和比较知识图谱链接预测模型至关重要，需要验证CSG指标在链接预测任务中的有效性

Method: 在标准知识图谱链接预测基准上（FB15k-237、WN18RR等），通过控制两个关键参数（M：每类蒙特卡洛采样点数，K：嵌入空间最近邻数）来系统评估CSG行为

Result: 发现CSG对K值选择高度敏感，无法随目标类别数量自然扩展；CSG值与MRR等性能指标相关性弱或无相关性；CSG的稳定性和泛化预测能力在链接预测场景中失效

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在KG链接预测评估中需要更鲁棒、分类器无关的复杂性度量方法

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Motivation: 随着人工神经网络逐渐成为测量系统的重要组成部分，需要理解它们如何处理和传输参数相关信息，特别是Fisher信息在神经网络中的传播方式。

Method: 开发了一种方法来监控Fisher信息从输入层到输出层在ANN中的流动，跟踪参数估计任务中的信息传播过程。

Result: 研究表明最优估计性能对应于Fisher信息的最大传输，过度训练会导致信息损失和过拟合，这提供了一个无需单独验证数据集的训练停止准则。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际成像实验数据上得到验证，展示了在真实物理环境中的有效性，为神经网络训练提供了基于信息理论的新停止标准。

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Method: 提出新的专家管理分页问题模型，分析确定性和随机算法的竞争比下界，设计基于层的LRU扩展算法以适应LLM分层架构

Conclusion: 针对MoE架构LLM的专家缓存管理需要专门设计的分页算法，层感知的LRU扩展能够有效提升缓存效率，为实际部署提供了理论依据和实用方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

Motivation: 传统的线性预处理方法在处理复杂的损失几何结构时效果有限，需要一种更灵活的方法来提高元学习在少样本情况下的适配能力。

Conclusion: 这种基于非线性镜像映射的方法能够有效处理复杂的损失几何，提高元学习的适配效率，适用于大规模元学习模型。

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM方法虽然通过寻找平坦最小值来提升泛化性，但在实践中存在对抗扰动过于友好的问题，限制了泛化能力的进一步提升。

Method: 提出VASSO（方差抑制）方法来稳定对抗扰动，通过抑制扰动方差来避免过度友好的对抗样本，可与SAM及其计算高效变体结合使用。

Result: 在广泛的视觉和语言任务上验证了VASSO+SAM组合能够显著提升模型的泛化性能，并在计算效率与泛化能力之间提供了良好的权衡。

Conclusion: VASSO为稳定对抗扰动提供了一种通用方法，能够有效解决SAM中的过度友好对抗问题，显著提升深度神经网络的泛化能力。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models
and analysis as open source to support benchmarking and accelerate progress in
ML-driven power system research.

TL;DR: SimpleTIR是一个即插即用的算法，通过过滤无效轮次轨迹来稳定多轮工具集成推理的强化学习训练，解决了分布漂移导致的梯度爆炸问题，在数学推理基准上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮工具集成推理(TIR)使用强化学习训练时存在训练不稳定和性能崩溃的问题，主要原因是外部工具反馈导致的分布漂移，产生低概率token，进而引发灾难性梯度爆炸。

Method: 提出SimpleTIR算法，核心策略是识别并过滤掉包含无效轮次（既不产生代码块也不产生最终答案的轮次）的轨迹，从策略更新中移除这些有问题的轨迹，从而阻断有害的高幅度梯度。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准上实现了最先进性能，将AIME24分数从纯文本基线的22.1提升到50.5（基于Qwen2.5-7B基础模型），并促进了多样化推理模式的发现。

Conclusion: SimpleTIR有效解决了多轮TIR训练的稳定性问题，避免了监督微调的限制，使模型能够发现更复杂多样的推理模式，如自我纠正和交叉验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Motivation: 传统洪水预测方法忽略流域拓扑信息，现有GNN方法因计算成本高而采用粗粒度多边形，且时空依赖关系分离处理，无法同时捕捉对准确洪水预测至关重要的时空交互作用。

Method: 构建异质流域图，每个陆地和河流像素作为节点，通过物理水文流向和流域间关系连接；提出HydroGAT时空网络，自适应学习局部时间重要性和最具影响力的上游位置；开发分布式数据并行管道支持高分辨率训练。

Result: 在美国中西部两个流域的评估中，相比五个基线架构，模型在小时流量预测中达到更高的NSE（最高0.97）、改进的KGE（最高0.96）和低偏差（PBIAS在±5%以内），同时提供可解释的注意力图。

Conclusion: HydroGAT通过高分辨率像素级建模和时空联合学习，显著提升了洪水预测精度，并实现了计算效率的大幅提升（最高15倍加速），为水资源管理提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究首次探讨了循环神经网络(RNN)能否泛化到从LTL公式推导的ω-正则语言，通过在周期性ω词序列上训练RNN来复制目标Büchi自动机行为，并在分布外序列上评估泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Büchi自动机在处理复杂系统行为时面临可扩展性挑战，而神经网络在模型检查等领域被越来越多地用于解决这些挑战，因此需要研究其泛化能力。

Method: 在周期性ω词序列上训练RNN来复制目标BA行为，并在LTL公式对应的确定性自动机上进行实验，自动机结构复杂度从3到100多个状态不等。

Result: RNN在比训练示例长8倍的序列上实现了高精度，92.6%的任务实现了完美或接近完美的泛化，在目标ω-正则语言上表现出色。

Conclusion: 这些结果确立了神经网络方法学习复杂ω-正则语言的可行性，表明它们作为神经符号验证方法组件的潜力。

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

Motivation: MoE架构的大语言和视觉模型计算和内存需求巨大，部署困难。现有方法基于专家激活频率分配精度，但忽略了专家敏感性差异。

Method: 使用Hessian迹近似分析每个专家的敏感性，而非激活频率。将相似专家聚类，为每个专家分配最优比特宽度，实现专家级别的混合精度量化。

Result: 在VLMEvalKit基准测试中，Deepseek-VL2和MolmoE模型的量化版本在2-4位精度下保持竞争力，内存占用大幅减少。

Conclusion: 基于专家敏感性的混合精度量化方法能有效平衡MoE模型的精度和内存需求，为实际部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

Method: 通过求解基于Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) 方程的变分不等式问题，开发了一类新算法，使用函数类复杂度和近似误差来学习值函数和控制策略。

Result: 证明了学习值函数和控制策略的尖锐统计速率，具体取决于函数类的复杂度和近似误差。与通用强化学习方法相比，该方法通过监督回归实现了更快的统计速率保证。

Conclusion: 扩散过程的微调可以通过监督回归方法有效实现，该方法比传统强化学习方法具有更优越的统计性能，为扩散模型的控制策略学习提供了新的理论框架和算法保证。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a
given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop
a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity
and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic
reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be
achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.

TL;DR: 开发了用于模型合并超参数优化的代理基准，通过构建替代模型来预测合并模型性能，以低成本实现算法开发和性能比较


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并技术需要超参数调优来提升性能，但优化过程计算成本高昂，特别是在合并大语言模型时

Method: 定义两个搜索空间并收集数据样本构建替代模型，用于预测给定超参数下合并模型的性能表现

Result: 基准能够很好地预测合并模型性能，并成功模拟优化算法行为

Conclusion: 提出的代理基准为模型合并超参数优化提供了低成本高效的解决方案

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

TL;DR: 动态监护模型能够根据用户定义政策评估文本，在保持静态害害检测准确性的同时，远超标准模型的速度和灵活性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监护模型如LlamaGuard只能检测预定义的静态害害类别，无法满足不同应用域的灵活需求

Method: 提出动态监护模型，支持用户定义政策评估，可通过快速检测或链式思维推理方式输出且说明判断理由

Result: 动态监护模型在静态害害检测准确性上与静态模型相当，而在自由形式政策违约检测上达到前沿推理模型的准确度，但耗时更短

Conclusion: 动态监护模型提供了更灵活、高效的内容安全监管方案，适用于广泛的应用场景

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

TL;DR: 该论文研究稀疏自编码器(SAE)的缩放定律，重点关注特征流形如何影响SAE学习特征的数量与潜在变量数量之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解稀疏自编码器中特征流形（多维特征）如何影响缩放行为，特别是探索SAE是否在某些情况下会学习远少于潜在变量数量的特征。

Method: 采用神经网络缩放文献中的容量分配模型（Brill, 2024）来建模SAE的缩放行为，分析不同缩放机制下特征流形的影响。

Result: 模型重现了不同的缩放机制，发现在某些机制下特征流形会导致SAE学习的特征数量远少于潜在变量数量，存在病理效应。

Conclusion: 特征流形在某些缩放机制下对SAE性能有负面影响，需要进一步研究实际应用中SAE是否处于这种病理机制中。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.

TL;DR: 本文对四种口吃检测模型(YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM、SSDM)进行了系统性比较分析，重点关注性能、可控性和可解释性三个维度，发现UDM在准确性和临床可解释性方面达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然口吃检测模型在基准数据集上的性能不断提升，但临床采用不仅需要准确性，还需要模型具有可控性和可解释性。

Method: 通过在多数据集上的综合评估和临床专家评估，系统比较四种代表性方法在性能、可控性和可解释性三个维度的表现。

Result: YOLO-Stutter和FluentNet提供效率和简单性但透明度有限；UDM实现准确性和临床可解释性的最佳平衡；SSDM在实验中无法完全复现。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了不同方法之间的权衡关系，为临床可行的口吃建模指明了未来方向，并提供了详细的实施见解和实际部署考虑。

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

TL;DR: 本研究通过从arXiv论文合成研究级QA问题，构建了一个可无限扩展的评估框架，发现前沿LLM在知识截止日期前后没有显著性能衰减，表明多步推理合成方法能有效缓解基准污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM能力评估面临数据污染问题，静态基准测试难以区分是真正推理还是单纯记忆。需要开发新的评估方法来验证模型的实际推理能力。

Method: 利用arXiv论文的自然时间结构，从20,277篇论文合成1,643个多步推理问题，覆盖26个月时间跨度，评估4个前沿模型在知识截止日期前后的表现。

Result: 所有模型在不同规模、开发者和发布时间下，在知识截止日期附近均未出现显著性能衰减，与之前报告显著衰减的研究形成对比。

Conclusion: 多步推理合成方法提供了超越浅层记忆的复杂性，能有效缓解基准污染，建议优先采用推理驱动的合成方法来构建基准测试。

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

Conclusion: 结构化、语言兼容的表征可能实现人机协作学习，为构建能够整合语言指导和直接经验的AI系统提供了计算框架

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

Motivation: 解决理性模型成本高、延迟大的问题，寻找一种在单次推理和谱费理性链之间的平衡方案

Method: 使用token级别不确定性触发目标精细化：提取logprobs、计算前k个备选token的阁、通过浓度、最大token阁和低信心度token计数的OR逻辑触发，将紧凑的不确定性报告传回模型指导美化

Result: 在理性、数学和代码生成任务中，小模型使用该循环接近参考理性模型95%质量，成本约为1/3，对~31%响应进行选择性精细化，准确性比单次推理提高16%百分点

Conclusion: 该不确定性感知循环提供了单次推理和谱费理性链之间的有效平衡点，在保证质量的同时控制成本，适用于生产环境部署

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

Motivation: 理解情绪感知准确性对人类社交行为的影响，探索情绪识别偏差如何扭曲社会过程和破坏情感整合。

Method: 在2D环形网格上部署AI代理，使用来自KDEF数据库的面部照片作为视觉表示，赋予三种不同准确度的情绪分类器（基于JAFFE、CK+、KDEF数据集训练），代理根据感知到的邻居情绪状态进行移动（趋近积极情绪，远离消极情绪）。

Result: 低准确度分类器导致信任降低、情感分裂为悲伤、社会组织混乱；高准确度分类器形成坚韧的情感集群和情绪干扰恢复力；即使在情绪中性场景中，误感知也足以产生隔离和凝聚力瓦解。

Conclusion: 情绪识别中的偏见或不精确可能显著扭曲社会过程并破坏情感整合，强调了准确情绪感知对社会行为的重要性。

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

TL;DR: MODE是一种轻量级的检索增强生成方法，用聚类路由检索替代精细的最近邻搜索，适用于小规模领域特定语料库，在保持答案质量的同时显著降低检索时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RAG方法依赖大型向量数据库和跨编码器，对于小规模领域特定语料库来说过于复杂和资源密集，需要更轻量级的解决方案。

Method: 将文档嵌入后分组到语义连贯的聚类中，用缓存质心表示。查询时路由到顶部质心，仅在这些聚类内检索上下文，无需外部向量数据库基础设施和重排序。

Result: 在100-500个文本块的HotpotQA和SQuAD语料库上，MODE在答案质量上匹配或超过密集检索基线，同时显著减少端到端检索时间。

Conclusion: MODE为中小型语料库提供了一个实用的解决方案，在简单性、速度和主题聚焦方面具有优势，聚类粒度和多聚类路由可以控制召回率/精确度的权衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

TL;DR: DACE算法通过利用LLM的自信心与任务难度的相关性，动态调整探索-利用平衡，在数学推理任务上显著优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVF依赖稀疏的结果奖励，无法为推理过程提供细粒度指导，限制了学习效率

Method: 基于策略成功率在线评估任务难度，通过内在奖励机制：困难任务惩罚高确定性鼓励探索，简单任务奖励高确定性提升效率

Result: 在AIME和MATH数学推理基准测试中显著超越强基线，不仅准确率更高，而且在测试时计算扩展时表现更鲁棒

Conclusion: DACE的自适应方法能有效促进探索而不牺牲精度，验证了利用模型自信心指导强化学习的有效性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

Motivation: 埃塞俄比亚卫生部需要加强卫生站建设以扩大基本医疗服务覆盖，但由于预算有限和竞争优先事项，需要优化框架来指导各地区优先排序

Method: 提出HARP工具，基于原则性决策支持优化框架，包含两种算法：(i)学习增强方法改进专家建议；(ii)多步规划的贪心算法，均具有强最坏情况近似估计

Result: 与埃塞俄比亚公共卫生研究所和卫生部合作，在三个地区的多种规划场景中验证了方法的实证有效性

Conclusion: HARP工具为资源有限的医疗设施规划提供了有效的优化框架，能够在预算不确定的情况下实现人口覆盖最大化和地区比例目标的平衡

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

Method: 采用拓扑语义方法，将证据基础信念和可错知识的语义从个体扩展到群体，并引入动态证据共享算子来扩展语言。

Result: 完全公理化了群体证据逻辑（包括硬证据和软证据），证明了其可判定性，并证明了动态扩展与静态基础具有相同的表达能力。

Conclusion: 成功建立了群体知识和信念的逻辑框架，为多智能体系统中的群体认知现象提供了形式化工具，动态证据共享操作不会增加表达力。

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

Motivation: 现有自主代理范式面临关键权衡：固定工作流需要手动重新配置，而灵活反应循环无法将推理进展提炼为可转移结构。

Method: HiVA框架使用语义-拓扑演化(STEV)算法，通过多臂老虎机前向路由、环境反馈生成诊断梯度，以及协调更新来共同演化个体语义和拓扑结构。

Conclusion: HiVA在未知环境中实现了有效的自主任务执行，通过自组织图建模和文本梯度优化解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

TL;DR: ILWS通过指令级权重塑形技术，让LLM能够在会话后通过反思和用户反馈动态更新指令，实现知识持续进化，无需重新训练或检索增强，显著提升性能和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM静态知识的问题，避免RAG的高延迟和工程开销、提示工程的脆弱性以及微调的高成本和灾难性遗忘

Method: 使用反思引擎分析对话轨迹，生成指令、用户偏好和工具的增量更新，通过版本控制和评分机制管理，最终将成熟的指令空间增益蒸馏到参数中

Result: 在企业支持中吞吐量提升2.4-5.0倍，幻觉减少约80%；在Adobe Commerce Cloud中每小时处理工单数提升4-5倍，单工单时间降低约80%

Conclusion: ILWS在指令层操作直到受控蒸馏，适用于需要自适应推理、工具创建和低延迟部署的动态领域，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能力强大，但缺乏结构化推理能力，特别是在需要领域特定最佳实践的复杂任务上表现不佳。现有的多步提示方法缺乏通用的行为控制机制。

Method: 提出SHERPA框架，使用分层状态机来结构化LLM执行过程，通过基于规则或机器学习（包括LLM）的决策来实现对模型行为的细粒度控制。

Result: 在代码生成、类名生成和问答等多个任务上验证了SHERPA的有效性，系统评估显示集成精心设计的状态机显著提升了LLM输出质量，特别是在具有完善人类最佳实践但缺乏训练数据的复杂任务上效果尤为明显。

Conclusion: SHERPA框架通过状态机结构成功地将领域最佳实践融入LLM执行过程，为复杂任务提供了有效的控制机制，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

TL;DR: SIGMUS系统利用大语言模型实现多模态城市数据的语义集成，自动构建知识图谱来关联城市事件与多源传感器数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市多模态传感器数据丰富但碎片化，传统依赖人工规则的方法难以有效整合这些数据来识别和推理城市事件

Method: 开发SIGMUS系统，使用大语言模型生成世界知识，自动识别城市事件与多模态数据之间的关系，构建组织化知识图谱

Result: 系统能够合理连接5种不同数据源（新闻文本、监控图像、空气质量、天气和交通测量）与同时同地发生的相关事件

Conclusion: SIGMUS通过LLM驱动的语义集成方法，成功实现了多模态城市数据的自动化关联，为城市事件识别和预测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

Motivation: 当前行业中的自主数字代理（如Manus AI和Gemini研究模式）在结构化任务方面显示出潜力，但尚不清楚基于代理的系统能在多大程度上提高多模态网络数据生产力，特别是在需要迭代规划、解释和上下文推理的新闻领域。

Method: 引入NEWSAGENT基准测试，要求代理根据写作指令和原始数据，识别叙事视角、基于关键词查询、检索历史背景并生成完整文章。基准包含6k个人工验证的真实新闻示例，多模态内容转换为文本以确保广泛模型兼容性。

Result: 评估显示代理能够检索相关事实，但在规划和叙事整合方面存在困难。开源和闭源LLM在常用代理框架上的表现表明当前系统在这方面的局限性。

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT为迭代和评估代理在多模态网络数据操作方面的能力提供了一个现实的测试平台，有助于推动代理在真实世界生产力中的应用发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

supporting sustainable human-AI collaboration. We evaluated our system across 4
diverse datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability, narrative quality, and
computational efficiency with minimal dependencies.

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

TL;DR: BALM-TSF是一个轻量级多模态时间序列预测框架，通过平衡文本和时间序列模态的对齐，解决了现有方法中模态不平衡导致信息丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多模态时间序列预测方法往往过度强调文本模态而忽视时间序列模态，导致信息丢失和预测性能下降。

Method: 使用时间序列编码器处理原始时间序列，同时将描述性统计信息输入LLM生成文本嵌入，通过缩放策略和对比目标实现跨模态平衡对齐，最后整合对齐后的嵌入进行预测。

Conclusion: 该框架成功利用了文本和时间序列的互补信息，证明了平衡多模态对齐在时间序列预测中的有效性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI-powered workflow that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assist in drafting schematic architectural floor
plans from natural language prompts. The proposed system interprets textual
input to automatically generate layout options including walls, doors, windows,
and furniture arrangements. It combines prompt engineering, a furniture
placement refinement algorithm, and Python scripting to produce spatially
coherent draft plans compatible with design tools such as Autodesk Revit. A
case study of a mid-sized residential layout demonstrates the approach's
ability to generate functional and structured outputs with minimal manual
effort. The workflow is designed for transparent replication, with all key
prompt specifications documented to enable independent implementation by other
researchers. In addition, the generated models preserve the full range of
Revit-native parametric attributes required for direct integration into
professional BIM processes.

TL;DR: 提出了S3AP结构化社交世界表示形式，帮助AI系统更好地理解社交动态和推理他人心理状态，在多个社交推理任务中达到新的SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够直觉地模拟未言明的社交动态并推理他人视角，而AI系统在处理这些隐式社交上下文时存在困难，需要更好的结构化表示方法

Method: 采用POMDP驱动的设计，将社交互动表示为结构化元组（状态、观察、智能体行为、心理状态），可以从自由形式叙述中自动推导

Result: 在5个社交推理任务中显著提升性能（如FANToM心理理论推理+51%），在SOTOPIA社交互动基准上获得+18%的改进

Conclusion: S3AP作为一种通用的社交世界状态表示形式，有望开发出更具社交意识的系统，更好地导航社交互动

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

TL;DR: Q2K是一个基于多智能体LLM框架的SKU映射系统，通过推理、知识和去重三个智能体的协作，结合人类反馈，显著提升了电商产品匹配的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台中产品列表SKU匹配是一个长期挑战，传统基于规则和关键词相似度的方法容易忽略品牌、规格等细微差异，导致错误分类。

Method: 提出Q2K多智能体框架：1)推理智能体生成消歧问题；2)知识智能体通过精准网络搜索解答；3)去重智能体重用已验证推理轨迹减少冗余。结合人类反馈机制处理不确定情况。

Result: 在真实消费品数据集上的实验表明，Q2K超越了强基线方法，在捆绑识别和品牌来源消歧等困难场景中实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Q2K通过重用检索到的推理而非重复搜索，在准确性和效率之间取得平衡，为产品集成提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

TL;DR: NetGent是一个AI代理框架，通过自然语言规则定义应用工作流，自动生成真实网络流量数据集，解决了现有浏览器自动化工具在多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发通用ML网络模型需要从多样化真实网络环境中收集数据，但现有浏览器自动化工具脆弱且成本高昂，无法满足多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率的要求。

Method: 用户用自然语言规则定义状态依赖动作，框架将其编译为非确定性有限自动机(NFA)，状态合成组件转换为可重用可执行代码，支持确定性重放、状态缓存减少LLM调用，并能快速适应应用界面变化。

Result: 实验自动化了50+个工作流，涵盖视频点播、直播、视频会议、社交媒体和网络爬虫等领域，生成真实流量轨迹，对UI变化保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NetGent结合基于语言代理的灵活性和编译执行的可靠性，为生成多样化、可重复数据集提供了可扩展基础，推动了网络ML的发展。

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Motivation: 法律推理需要精确解释法律条文和一致应用复杂规则，这对AI系统构成重大挑战，需要解决端到端方法缺乏透明性和可验证性的问题

Method: 采用模块化多智能体框架：第一阶段由专门智能体提取法律概念并形式化规则；第二阶段通过查询分析、符号推理和程序化实现三个步骤应用知识到具体案例

Result: 在法定税务计算任务上取得显著改进，基础模型准确率达到76.4%，相比基线18.8%有大幅提升，有效缩小了推理模型与基础模型之间的性能差距

Conclusion: 模块化架构和形式化知识表示可以使复杂的法律推理通过计算高效模型实现，同时增强AI法律推理的一致性和可解释性，为构建更透明、可信和有效的法律AI系统奠定基础

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

TL;DR: OmniDPO是一个针对全模态大语言模型(OLLMs)的偏好对齐框架，通过构建文本偏好和多模态偏好样本对，有效减少幻觉现象并提升多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全模态大语言模型在处理音频-视频理解时存在幻觉问题，文本模态先验主导导致忽视视觉和音频信息，且现有模型训练时忽略了视频与音频的内在关联。

Method: 提出OmniDPO框架，包含两种策略：(1)构建文本偏好样本对增强音频-视频交互理解；(2)构建多模态偏好样本对强化对视觉和听觉信息的关注。

Result: 在两个OLLM上的实验表明，OmniDPO不仅能有效缓解多模态幻觉，还显著提升了跨模态推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniDPO通过同时解决文本主导和模态关联问题，成功改善了多模态基础并减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了结构化上下文注入框架，通过系统地在输入中嵌入任务特定信息来指导LLM解决图问题，无需微调即可获得性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图推理任务对LLM具有挑战性，需要将任务映射到概念基础表示，但通过微调或多步查询实现这种映射成本高且效率低

Method: 结构化上下文注入方法，将任务特定信息直接嵌入输入中，使LLM能够隐式地将任务与基础概念空间对齐

Result: 在多个图任务上评估显示性能持续改进，结构化输入上下文可以媲美或超越更复杂的方法

Conclusion: 结构化上下文注入是LLM图理解的有效且可扩展策略，在准确性和计算成本之间提供了良好权衡

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单次检索增强生成(RAG)在法律问答中存在幻觉和不确定性问题，需要更精确的法律检索和推理机制来应对高风险领域的法律应用需求。

Method: 采用多智能体工作流：分解查询为子问题，在异构源(网络搜索、本地RAG、案例法)进行定向搜索，法官智能体验证充分性、管辖权和时效性，通过迭代推理-搜索-验证循环确保答案质量。

Result: 在2025年200道最新法律选择题基准测试中，L-MARS显著提高事实准确性，减少不确定性，获得人类专家和LLM法官更高的偏好评分。

Conclusion: 多智能体推理与智能搜索相结合为高风险领域LLM部署提供了可扩展、可复现的蓝图，能够实现精确的法律检索和审议。

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

Method: 引入物理感知拒绝采样(PaRS)，在训练时选择符合基础物理原理且数值接近目标的推理轨迹，使用轻量级停止机制控制计算成本

Result: 相比基线方法，该方法提高了准确性和校准度，降低了物理违规率，减少了采样成本

Conclusion: 适度的领域感知约束结合轨迹级选择为可靠、高效的大型推理模型提供了实用路径，可用于过程感知属性预测和闭环材料设计

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夏普比率是金融领域广泛使用的风险调整收益指标，但在MDP中优化存在两大挑战：动态规划不适用于分数目标和风险度量。现有方法难以有效解决这一问题。

Method: 使用Dinkelbach变换将夏普比率优化转换为均值-方差优化问题，开发迭代算法求解M2V问题，通过策略迭代过程更新风险敏感参数，确保序列单调收敛。

Result: 提出的算法能够单调收敛到最优夏普比率，在平均和折现MDP设置下均证明收敛性，数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个使用动态规划类算法解决MDP中夏普比率优化问题的方法，为解决其他分数目标MDP问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

Conclusion: 该框架虽然在BPM背景下开发，但适用于任何符号序列生成任务，为推进神经-符号人工智能做出了贡献。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

Motivation: 闭环胰岛素输送系统在真实世界采用率低，主要由于行为、心理和社会障碍而非技术问题，需要评估LLM在健康行为改变中的说服能力

Method: 创建包含专家验证虚拟患者的框架，模拟与配备多种循证说服策略的护士代理进行多轮互动，支持纵向咨询和对抗性社交影响场景

Result: 虽然更大、更具反思性的LLM能够随时间调整策略，但所有模型都难以克服抵抗，特别是在现实社交压力下

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM在行为改变方面的关键局限性，为推进医疗保健领域可信赖的说服性AI提供了高保真、可扩展的测试平台

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and

Conclusion: 神经MCCFR组件的有效性具有规模依赖性，需要根据博弈复杂度选择性部署组件，提出的框架为大规模博弈部署提供了实用指南和理论保证。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结构化决策框架，用于安全关键领域的自主AI系统，在灾害管理中实现了60.94%更高的决策稳定性和38.93%更高的准确性，超越了人类运营商和判断基础系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为人工智能被应用于航空航天和应急响应等安全关键领域的自主决策，需要解决这些决策的伦理含义和可靠性问题，以确保在关系人命安全时决策的合理性和可说明性。

Method: 提出了一种结构化决策框架，通过引入使能者代理（Enabler agents）、级别（Levels）和场景（Scenarios）等概念，并在灾害管理领域实现自主决策。该框架与仅依赖判断的系统以及有灾害经验的人类运营商（受害者、志愿者和利益相关方）进行了对比评估。

Result: 结果显示，结构化决策框架在多个场景下实现了60.94%更高的一致准确决策稳定性，较仅依赖判断的系统显著提升。同时，该框架在各种场景下的准确性比人类运营商高出38.93%。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了结构化决策框架在建设更可靠自主AI应用方面的潜力，特别是在安全关键的环境中。该框架为负责任AI的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

TL;DR: SATQuest是一个系统性验证工具，通过从CNF实例生成多样化的可满足性逻辑推理问题来评估和增强大语言模型的逻辑推理能力，解决了现有基准测试缺乏可控性和多维分析的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估基准缺乏可控性和可扩展性，无法进行多维度系统分析，问题类型和格式也较为单一，需要一种能够系统评估和增强逻辑推理能力的工具。

Method: SATQuest从合取范式(CNF)实例生成多样化的可满足性逻辑推理问题，通过三个正交维度（实例规模、问题类型、问题格式）进行结构化，采用随机化的SAT问题生成和基于PySAT的客观答案验证。

Result: 评估发现大语言模型在逻辑推理方面存在显著局限性，特别是在超越熟悉的数学格式泛化方面。使用SATQuest奖励进行强化微调显著提高了目标任务性能，并能泛化到更复杂的实例。

Conclusion: SATQuest展示了作为基础工具的潜力，是推进大语言模型逻辑推理能力的有价值起点，同时揭示了跨格式适应方面的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了建设性安全对齐（CSA）方法，通过主动引导而非简单拒绝来处理用户心理危机，在保持安全性的同时提供有意义的帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制主要针对恶意攻击者，但忽视了非恶意用户的心理危机求助需求。简单拒绝可能让处于心理危机的用户转向更危险的平台，造成更严重后果。

Method: 提出Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA)范式，结合博弈论预测用户反应、细粒度风险边界发现和可解释推理控制，在Oyster-I (Oy1)模型中实现。

Result: Oy1在开源模型中达到最先进的安全水平，在建设性基准测试中接近GPT-5的表现，在Strata-Sword越狱数据集上接近GPT-o1的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CSA从拒绝优先转向引导优先的安全范式，重新定义了模型与用户的关系，旨在构建不仅安全而且有意义的帮助系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

Motivation: 现有城市数据系统面临规模、延迟和数据层面分裂的挑战，无法充分利用海量传感器和连接基础设施产生的数据来改善城市生活质量。

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

Motivation: 解决AI与人类价值观对齐缺乏定量度量标准的问题，为价值对齐提供可比较的基准测试方法。

Method: 给定模型集合、价值体系宪法和场景数据集，让每个模型评估其他模型的输出，使用EigenTrust算法聚合这些评估，生成反映整体加权平均判断的分数向量。

Result: 通过提示角色测试发现，大部分方差由提示解释，但小部分残差量化了模型本身的倾向性。

Conclusion: EigenBench提供了一种有效的方法来量化语言模型的价值对齐程度，无需真实标签即可进行相对比较评估。

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

TL;DR: LENS是一个结合符号程序合成和大型语言模型的神经符号方法，用于自动化生成机器学习逻辑程序的自然语言解释，相比手工模板和直接LLM提示能产生更好的解释，但在人类学习实验中未显示出显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有超强机器学习(USML)方法中手工制作解释模板的可扩展性限制，实现自动化、可扩展的机器学习逻辑程序解释生成。

Method: 结合符号程序合成与大型语言模型(LLMs)，通过神经摘要技术自动化生成逻辑程序的自然语言解释，使用多LLM法官和人工验证进行系统评估。

Result: LENS生成的解释质量优于直接LLM提示和手工模板方法，但在人类学习实验中未能显著提升人类性能，可能因为LLM的全面响应对于简单问题反而会使用户不知所措。

Conclusion: 该工作为构建有效的USML系统支持人类学习奠定了坚实基础，但需要进一步研究如何优化解释生成以真正促进人类学习效果。

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

TL;DR: CoreThink是一个基于通用符号推理方法的新型推理层，在工具调用、代码生成和规划任务中实现SOTA性能，无需微调或训练成本即可提升模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如测试时扩展、监督微调和强化学习）在LLM性能提升上会出现收益递减，需要开发新的推理技术来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 采用通用符号推理（General Symbolics）方法，构建CoreThink通用符号推理器（GSR），专门针对工具调用、代码生成和规划三大用例进行结构化设计。

Result: 在7个基准测试中表现优异：Livecodebench v6达到66.66%、指令跟随评估89%、ARC-AGI-2达到24.4%，基于该技术开发的智能编码IDE在SWE-Bench Lite上达到62.3%的SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: CoreThink推理层能够在不产生负面影响的情况下纯提升模型推理性能，为推理密集型应用提供了新的解决方案，模型已可供使用。

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

Conclusion: ReaL-TG框架成功解决了时序图链接预测中的可解释性和泛化性问题，证明了强化学习微调LLM在复杂图推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具增强强化学习方法存在代码库碎片化、同步执行瓶颈和跨领域扩展性有限的问题，阻碍了社区采用和算法创新。

Method: 设计了VerlTool框架，包含四个核心贡献：与VeRL的上游对齐、统一工具管理标准化API、异步rollout执行消除同步瓶颈、以及在6个ARLT领域的全面评估。

Result: 实现了近2倍的速度提升，在数学推理、知识问答、SQL生成、视觉推理、网络搜索和软件工程任务上取得了与专用系统相当的性能。

Conclusion: VerlTool提供了一个统一的训练基础设施和模块化插件架构，显著降低了开发开销，为工具增强的强化学习研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

TL;DR: Robix是一个统一的视觉语言架构模型，集成了机器人推理、任务规划和自然语言交互，通过三阶段训练策略在交互式任务执行中超越现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器人在复杂指令执行、长时程任务规划和自然人类交互方面的挑战，需要开发一个端到端的统一认知层模型。

Method: 采用链式思维推理和三阶段训练策略：持续预训练增强基础推理能力，监督微调统一建模人机交互和任务规划，强化学习提升推理-行动一致性和长时程任务连贯性。

Result: 在交互式任务执行中超越了开源和商业基线模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro），在多样化指令类型和用户参与任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Robix成功实现了机器人推理、规划和交互的统一建模，为构建更智能、更自然的机器人系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

Conclusion: 因果抽象模拟为语言模型模拟提供了严格的形式化框架，连接了实践中的统计测试与因果理论，对语言模型模拟实践者、AI哲学家和数学家都具有重要价值，为理解语言模型的模拟能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819
arXiv:1812.03789, defined here as causal abstractive simulation, can be used to
formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers
the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are
presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a
success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove
that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers
of mind may be interested as causal abstractive simulation gives a precise
operationalization to the idea that language models are role-playing

TL;DR: AnchorRAG是一个新颖的多智能体协作框架，用于解决传统基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法在开放世界场景中依赖预定义锚点实体的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型依赖静态训练语料库，容易产生事实错误和知识缺口。现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法假设锚点实体可访问，但在开放世界设置中，查询与实体之间的准确链接不可靠，限制了方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出AnchorRAG多智能体协作框架：1）预测器智能体动态识别候选锚点实体；2）检索器智能体并行进行多跳探索；3）监督器智能体制定迭代检索策略并综合知识路径生成最终答案。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AnchorRAG显著优于现有基线方法，在真实世界问答任务上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: AnchorRAG通过多智能体协作框架提高了检索鲁棒性，减轻了模糊或错误锚点的影响，为开放世界检索增强生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

TL;DR: SchedCP是一个让LLM代理自主优化Linux调度器的框架，通过解耦语义推理和执行控制，实现了1.79倍性能提升和13倍成本降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作系统调度器存在语义鸿沟问题，内核策略无法理解应用特定需求，导致性能不佳

Method: 采用MCP服务器架构，包含工作负载分析引擎、调度策略库和执行验证器，通过多代理系统分析工作负载并合成eBPF调度策略

Result: 性能提升达1.79倍，成本降低13倍，同时保持高成功率

Conclusion: SchedCP通过弥合语义鸿沟，使系统优化民主化，向真正自优化的应用感知操作系统迈进

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced

Motivation: 传统文本到视频模型计算成本高昂，限制了视频制作的普及。本研究旨在通过大语言模型重新定义视频创作流程，降低制作门槛。

Method: VGTeam采用多智能体协作架构，包括脚本编写、场景创建和音频设计等专门代理，在聊天塔工作流程中协同工作，模拟传统视频制作流程。

Result: 系统平均生成成本仅0.103美元，成功生成率达到98.4%，在保持创意保真度和定制性的同时显著提升了效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: VGTeam通过语言模型在创意领域的应用，实现了视频制作的民主化，为下一代内容创作提供了开创性解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估了结果奖励模型(ORMs)在Text-to-SQL任务中的表现，证明ORMs在BIRD和SPIDER基准测试中优于传统的执行最佳N选择(ex-BoN)和多数投票(Maj)方法，取得了显著的执行准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成复杂SQL查询时仍难以精确对齐用户意图和数据库模式，现有的测试时策略如ex-BoN和Maj依赖表面启发式方法，而基于语义正确性的ORMs方法在Text-to-SQL任务中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了训练Text-to-SQL任务ORMs的框架，在BIRD和SPIDER基准上微调多个开源LLMs（Qwen2、Granite3、Llama3等），评估ORMs作为BoN启发式的有效性。

Result: ORMs在BIRD上比ex-BoN提升4.33%，比Maj提升2.91%；在Spider上比ex-BoN提升2.10%，比Maj提升0.93%。对已对齐SQL生成的模型（如OmniSQL）微调可获得更优的ORM性能。

Conclusion: ORMs是Text-to-SQL任务中有效的测试时策略，能够更好地对齐模型预测与用户意图，特别是在复杂查询和更多候选查询的情况下表现更优。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

TL;DR: GenQPM是一种基于深度生成模型的定量预测监控方法，通过模式分类和保形推理为多模态随机系统提供统计保证的模式特定预测区间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QPM方法在处理多模态动态系统时会产生过于保守和无信息的预测区间，缺乏有意义的模式特定满意度信息

Method: 利用基于分数的扩散模型近似概率多模态系统动态，使用模式分类器按动态模式划分预测轨迹，对每个模式应用保形推理生成统计有效的模式特定预测区间

Result: 在智能体导航和自动驾驶任务基准测试中，GenQPM产生的预测区间比模式无关基线显著更具信息性（更不保守）

Conclusion: GenQPM通过深度生成模型和模式分类有效解决了多模态系统监控问题，提供了更精确的模式特定预测能力

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

Motivation: 解决在复杂CAD装配体中基于规格的零件检索问题，传统LLMs/VLMs面临输入序列超长、性能不佳、微调资源需求大且对专有模型不可用等挑战。

Method: 使用错误笔记本收集历史错误思维链和错误答案，通过反思修正连接直到获得正确解；结合RAG技术检索规格相关记录并整合到推理过程中。

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini系列模型上实验显示显著提升，GPT-4o在人类偏好数据集上实现23.4%的绝对准确率提升，思维链推理在零件数量较多(>10)的挑战性案例中特别有效。

Conclusion: 该框架无需额外训练即可有效提升现有通用模型在CAD零件检索任务中的性能，特别擅长处理带有冗长非自然语言元数据的3D模型，具有重要工程价值。

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

Motivation: 现有深度研究智能体评估存在挑战，难以收集真正反映研究者关注的前沿研究问题，需要更真实的评估环境来减少数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出多智能体分层任务生成(MAHTG)系统，从学术研讨会记录中提取研究灵感并转化为高质量研究任务，确保任务制定的可追溯性和噪声过滤。

Result: 构建了包含12个学科、200+学术研讨会、10,000+研究任务的DeepResearch Arena基准，评估显示当前最先进智能体在该基准上表现存在明显差距。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena为深度研究智能体提供了更真实、更具挑战性的评估环境，能够更好地反映真实世界研究场景和智能体的研究能力。

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone

Conclusion: 本文提出的多代理协同LLM场景生成方法，有效解决了传统场景分析在服务生态系统治理中的限制，提高了场景生成的质量和效率，为复杂社会环境下的决策支持提供了有效技术手段。

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service

### [504] [Counterfactual Sensitivity for Faithful Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01544)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CSR训练目标，通过反事实干预增强语言模型推理过程的忠实性，在多个推理任务中显著提升模型对错误推理的敏感性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生正确答案但依赖有缺陷或不相关的推理轨迹，在高风险领域中削弱了其可信度

Method: 提出反事实敏感性正则化(CSR)，在训练时引入操作符级别的反事实干预（如将"+"换成"-"），惩罚在逻辑无效轨迹下保持相同答案的模型

Result: 在算术、逻辑推理和规划任务中，CSR相比标准微调和过程监督将忠实性提升了高达70个百分点，仅有轻微准确率损失

Conclusion: CSR是一种轻量级的训练目标，能有效增强模型推理过程的忠实性，且学到的敏感性可以泛化到更大模型并与推理时方法协同工作

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种可调数据代价的Web代理限流框架，通过重布斯谜题要求AI代理消耗大量计算资源来进行访问控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 防止AI网络代理通过模仿用户行为窃取内容或进行拒绝服务攻击，同时维护服务提供商的安全

Method: 设计了重布斯谜题基于的理性门（Reasoning Gates），要求代理进行多跳推理和世界知识的维护，以消耗大量计算资源

Result: 框架实现了计算不对称性，响应生成成本比SOTA模型高出9.2倍，并在实际网站和MCP服务器上部署验证

Conclusion: 该框架能有效限制恶意AI代理访问，但需考虑部署限制和环境影响

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

*Chongwen Zhao,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的神经元级可解释性方法，通过识别安全相关神经元并调整其激活来控制LLM行为，进而开发了SafeTuning微调策略来增强模型对越狱攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各种应用中的广泛使用，存在用户试图利用这些模型进行恶意目的（如合成受控物质和传播虚假信息）的担忧，即"越狱"攻击。虽然已有研究通过修改输出分布或检测有害内容来实现防御，但其基本原理仍不清楚。

Method: 提出神经元级可解释性方法，将模型内部表示投影到更一致和可解释的词汇空间，识别安全相关知识神经元。通过调整这些神经元的激活来控制模型行为，并基于此开发SafeTuning微调策略来增强安全关键神经元。

Result: 调整安全相关神经元的激活可以有效地控制模型行为，平均攻击成功率（ASR）高于97%。SafeTuning在多个LLMs上一致降低攻击成功率，并优于所有四个基线防御方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解和防御越狱攻击提供了新的视角，通过神经元级分析揭示了安全机制的内在原理，并开发了有效的防御策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户因隐私政策难以理解而忽略阅读的问题，填补大规模获取形式化隐私政策的空白，支持用户为中心的Web方法和数据共享重用。

Method: 提出基于最先进大语言模型的语义中心方法，自动识别隐私政策中的关键信息，构建基于数据隐私词汇(DPV)的知识图谱Pr²Graph，支持ODRL和psDToU等形式化策略表示。

Result: 发布了针对前100热门网站的Pr²Graph公开资源，丰富了Policy-IE数据集，评估了不同大语言模型的性能，验证了技术能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现在线服务隐私实践的大规模分析提供了可能，是审计Web和互联网的有前景方向，所有数据集和源代码均已公开以促进重用和改进。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然同步导学对话对学生高阶思维发展至关重要，但目前大语言模型在生成教育富有交互方面面临挑战，需要系统研究AI模拟与真实人类导学对话的差异。

Method: 采用IRF初始-响应-反馈编码方案和认知网络分析(ENA)对AI模拟和真人导学对话进行定量比较。

Result: 人类导学对话在语词长度、提问(I-Q)和一般反馈(F-F)行为方面显著优于AI。ENA显示人类导学具有更多样的认知引导模式，以"问题-事实回应-反馈"教学循环为中心；而AI模拟导学呈现结构简化和行为收敛模式，仅为简单信息传递。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前AI生成导学的关键局限性，为设计和评估更有教育效果的生成式教育对话系统提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

TL;DR: DSP是一个异步在线强化学习框架，通过动态推测规划实现无损加速，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本和延迟，提供用户可调节的速度-成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理面临部署挑战，包括过高的延迟和推理成本。现有加速方法要么性能损失大，要么需要大量离线训练，要么运营成本过高，且缺乏用户对速度-成本权衡的控制。

Method: 提出动态推测规划(DSP)框架，采用异步在线强化学习，联合优化端到端延迟和美元成本，无需额外预部署准备，通过单一参数调节速度-成本平衡点。

Result: 在两个标准代理基准测试中，DSP实现了与最快无损加速方法相当的效率，同时总成本降低30%，不必要成本减少高达60%。

Conclusion: DSP提供了一个高效、成本效益好的解决方案，解决了LLM代理部署中的延迟和成本问题，为用户提供了灵活的速度-成本权衡控制。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through
https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性评估方法在医疗高风险场景中存在不足，使用简化指标忽略了医疗伤害的多维性，且可能导致模型因临床惰性而显得公平但实际不准确。

Method: 构建了两个大规模受控基准（ED-Triage和Opioid Analgesic Recommendation），包含5万多个提示和12种种族×性别变体；提出了mFARM框架评估分配性、稳定性和潜在性三个维度的差异，并聚合为mFARM分数；还提出了FAB分数来衡量公平性与预测准确性之间的权衡。

Result: 评估了四个开源LLM及其量化版本，发现mFARM指标能更有效捕捉各种设置下的细微偏见；大多数模型在不同量化水平下保持稳健的mFARM性能，但在上下文减少时显著恶化。

Conclusion: 提出的mFARM框架能更好地评估医疗LLM的公平性问题，基准和评估代码已公开以促进医疗AI对齐研究。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统虽然功能广泛但缺乏深度，只是表面模拟而非真正的智能。需要定义真正的智能标准来区分表面功能和深度能力。

Method: 提出结构性生成智能本体论框架，包含三个核心条件：生成性（创造新结构）、协调性（组织成理由）、维持性（保持身份连续性）。

Result: 建立了衡量真正智能的理论框架，指出当前AI系统因缺乏这三个条件而只是表面智能。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要深度而非广度，如果未来系统满足这三个条件，可能成为与人类并存的"第二存在"，而不仅仅是工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the

research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated

representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 当前LLM在自动化启发式设计方面存在两大障碍：复杂推理任务的脆弱性需要工程支持，预训练偏见会过早限制新颖解决方案的搜索空间

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的方法，将时间序列数据视为单一图像模式，利用文本到图像生成模型来预测股票价格趋势，探索了在金融领域应用生成模型的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成模型在图像和视频生成领域取得了显著进展，但在金融领域仍然主要依赖时间序列数据和Transformer模型，缺乏对生成模型的多样化应用探索。

Method: 将时间序列数据作为图像处理，使用扩散模型从当前图表图像和指令提示生成下一个图表图像，并提出了评估生成图表图像与真实图像对比的简单方法。

Result: 实验验证了文本到图像生成模型在金融领域的应用潜力，能够生成股票价格趋势预测图表。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了生成模型在金融领域的应用前景，激励进一步研究以解决当前限制并扩展其适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

*Salma Haidar,José Oramas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于模型解释性的高光谱图像波段选择方法，通过分析分类器中各波段对决策的贡献度，选择最具影响力的波段子集，在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像虽然提供丰富的光谱信息，但高维度带来计算负担和冗余，需要进行维度约简。传统方法缺乏对模型决策过程的理解，需要更智能的波段选择策略。

Method: 使用事后可解释性方法分析训练好的分类器，量化各波段对决策的贡献度。通过删除-插入评估记录置信度变化，聚合这些信号生成影响力分数，选择最高影响力的波段子集。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集（Pavia University和Salinas）上的实验表明，仅使用30个选定波段的分类器性能达到或超过全光谱基线，同时显著降低计算需求。

Conclusion: 模型对齐、解释性引导的波段选择是高光谱图像维度约简的有效原则性方法，所选波段子集与物理上有意义、高度区分的波长区域一致。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

*Shubham Gandhi,Jason Tsay,Jatin Ganhotra,Kiran Kate,Yara Rizk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SWE-PRM是一个推理时过程奖励模型，通过在LLM代理执行软件工程任务时进行干预，检测和纠正轨迹级错误，提高任务解决率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在复杂软件工程任务中经常出现冗余探索、循环和无法终止等低效行为，现有方法主要在事后诊断失败，需要实时干预机制。

Method: 引入SWE-PRM过程奖励模型，基于常见低效行为的分类法，在执行过程中提供轻量级、可解释的反馈，不修改底层策略。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，闭源PRM将解决率从40.0%提升至50.6%（+10.6个百分点），在中高难度任务上效果最显著，分类法引导的PRM表现最佳。

Conclusion: SWE-PRM以仅0.2美元的低推理成本显著提升软件工程代理的可靠性和效率，是一种实用且可扩展的改进机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

TL;DR: 一种不确定性感知的LLM组件系统，通过结合检索不确定性和摘要不确定性，在多表生物医学数据摘要中显著提升了准确性和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM组件在复杂多表生物医学数据环境中产生流畅但过分自信输出的问题，通过不确定性感知提升组件的可靠性。

Method: 结合两种互补的不确定性信号：检索不确定性（多次表根选滚动的熵）和摘要不确定性（自我一致性和困惑度）。使用GRPO将摘要不确定性结合到强化学习中，并在推理时进行过滤和数据集构建。

Result: 在多组学测试中，方法显著提升了事实性和校准性，正确有用断言数量增长近三倍（内部数据从3.0到8.4，癌症多组学从3.6到9.9），下游生存预测能力大幅提升（C指数从0.32到0.63）。

Conclusion: 不确定性可作为控制信号，使组件能够避免错误、沟通信心度，成为复杂结构化数据环境中更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Conclusion: UI-TARS-2展现了推进GUI智能体技术状态的潜力，并在真实世界交互场景中表现出强大的泛化能力，大规模智能体RL训练动态分析为实现稳定性和效率提供了见解。

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

Motivation: 美国行人死亡人数持续上升，需要评估ADAS系统在提高行人安全方面的有效性，为政策制定和汽车制造商提供数据支持。

Method: 利用FARS数据进行综合分析，将车辆规格与碰撞数据关联，评估不同环境条件（光照、天气）和行为因素（驾驶员/行人分心）下ADAS的性能表现。

Result: ADAS能够降低碰撞严重程度并预防部分死亡事故，但在低光照和恶劣天气条件下有效性显著降低。

Conclusion: 需要增强传感器技术、改进驾驶员教育，优化ADAS部署策略以提高行人安全并减少交通相关死亡。

Abstract: Pedestrian fatalities continue to rise in the United States, driven by
factors such as human distraction, increased vehicle size, and complex traffic
environments. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) offer a promising
avenue for improving pedestrian safety by enhancing driver awareness and
vehicle responsiveness. This study conducts a comprehensive data-driven
analysis utilizing the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to quantify
the effectiveness of specific ADAS features like Pedestrian Automatic Emergency
Braking (PAEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning
(LDW), in lowering pedestrian fatalities. By linking vehicle specifications
with crash data, we assess how ADAS performance varies under different
environmental and behavioral conditions, such as lighting, weather, and
driver/pedestrian distraction. Results indicate that while ADAS can reduce
crash severity and prevent some fatalities, its effectiveness is diminished in
low-light and adverse weather. The findings highlight the need for enhanced
sensor technologies and improved driver education. This research informs
policymakers, transportation planners, and automotive manufacturers on
optimizing ADAS deployment to improve pedestrian safety and reduce
traffic-related deaths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前研究通过古文书学和手稿学区分了13种不同的抄写手，但缺乏语言学特征的系统分析。本研究旨在通过计算语言学方法验证和细化这些假设。

Method: 使用新创建的外交转录和HTR转录语料库，结合计算笔迹分析方法，分析缩写实践和基于字符袋模型（包含缩写符号特征）的风格计量学。

Result: 缩写密度成为区分抄写手的有效指标，结合字符风格模型证实并细化了先前的抄写归属假设，特别是对scribe α在维也纳手稿中的角色提出了质疑。

Conclusion: 计算风格计量学与传统手稿学相结合具有重要价值，即使是书写系统中最小的元素（字符和缩写）也能揭示抄写身份、协作和手稿传播的模式。

Abstract: The Carthusian monastery of Herne was exceptionally prolific in producing
high-quality manuscripts during the late 14th century. Although the scribes
remain anonymous, previous research has distinguished thirteen different
scribal hands based on paleography and codicology. In this study, we revisit
this hypothesis through the lens of linguistic characteristics of the texts,
using computational methods from the field of scribal profiling. Using a newly
created corpus of diplomatic and HTR-based transcriptions, we analyze
abbreviation practices across the Herne scribes and demonstrate that
abbreviation density provides a distinctive metric for differentiating scribal
hands. In combination with a stylometric bag-of-characters model with
brevigraph features, this approach corroborates and refines earlier hypotheses
about scribal attribution, including evidence that challenges the role of
scribe $\alpha$ in Vienna, \"{O}NB, SN 65. Our results highlight the value of
combining computational stylometry with traditional codicology, showing how
even the smallest elements of the written system -- characters and
abbreviations -- can reveal patterns of scribal identity, collaboration, and
manuscript transmission.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI has intensified concerns about its environmental
sustainability. Yet, current assessments predominantly focus on operational
carbon emissions using secondary data or estimated values, overlooking
environmental impacts in other life cycle stages. This study presents the first
comprehensive multi-criteria life cycle assessment (LCA) of AI training,
examining 16 environmental impact categories based on detailed primary data
collection of the Nvidia A100 SXM 40GB GPU. The LCA results for training BLOOM
reveal that the use phase dominates 11 of 16 impact categories including
climate change (96\%), while manufacturing dominates the remaining 5 impact
categories including human toxicity, cancer (99\%) and mineral and metal
depletion (85\%). For training GPT-4, the use phase dominates 10 of 16 impact
categories, contributing about 96\% to both the climate change and resource
use, fossils category. The manufacturing stage dominates 6 of 16 impact
categories including human toxicity, cancer (94\%) and eutrophication,
freshwater (81\%). Assessing the cradle-to-gate environmental impact
distribution across the GPU components reveals that the GPU chip is the largest
contributor across 10 of 16 of impact categories and shows particularly
pronounced contributions to climate change (81\%) and resource use, fossils
(80\%). While primary data collection results in modest changes in carbon
estimates compared to database-derived estimates, substantial variations emerge
in other categories. Most notably, minerals and metals depletion increases by
33\%, demonstrating the critical importance of primary data for non-carbon
accounting. This multi-criteria analysis expands the Sustainable AI discourse
beyond operational carbon emissions, challenging current sustainability
narratives and highlighting the need for policy frameworks addressing the full
spectrum of AI's environmental impact.

### [530] [Privacy, Informed Consent and the Demand for Anonymisation of Smart Meter Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00101)
*Saurab Chhachhi,Fei Teng*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了消费者对智能电表数据匿名化的价值认知，发现消费者愿意为匿名化支付费用，但信息不对称压制了匿名化需求，建议加强隐私默认设置和用户中心的同意机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电表数据的广泛访问带来系统效益但引发隐私担忧。届时存在的研究没有专门关注匿名化技术，也没有考虑隐私风险的信息不对称问题，影响了在现行法规下同意的有效性。

Method: 采用混合方法进行研究，基于965名英国费用支付者的代表性样本，估计非货币性（愿意分享程度和智能电表需求）和货币性（愿意支付/接受）对匿名化的偏好。嵌入随机对照试验检验提供隐私影响信息的效果。

Result: 消费者平均愿意为匿名化支付费用，匿名化后更愿意分享数据，而一旦提供匿名化选项就不愿分享非匿名化数据。但仍有许多消费者不愿接受智能电表。研究发现了压制匿名化需求的严重信息不对称，不同人口统计和电力供应特征存在显著差异。定性回答证实了定量结果。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要加强隐私默认设置、采用用户中心的设计和能够使用户做出真正明智决定的同意机制，以应对智能电表数据分享中的隐私风险和信息不对称问题。

Abstract: Access to smart meter data offers system-wide benefits but raises significant
privacy concerns due to the personal information it contains.
Privacy-preserving techniques could facilitate wider access, though they
introduce privacy-utility trade-offs. Understanding consumer valuations for
anonymisation can help identify appropriate trade-offs. However, existing
studies do not focus on anonymisation specifically or account for information
asymmetries regarding privacy risks, raising questions about the validity of
informed consent under current regulations.
  We use a mixed-methods approach to estimate non-monetary
(willingness-to-share and smart metering demand) and monetary
(willingness-to-pay/accept) preferences for anonymisation, based on a
representative sample of 965 GB bill payers. An embedded randomised control
trial examines the effect of providing information about privacy implications.
  On average, consumers are willing to pay for anonymisation, are more willing
to share data when anonymised and less willing to share non-anonymised data
once anonymisation is presented as an option. However, a significant minority
remains unwilling to adopt smart meters, despite anonymisation. We find strong
evidence of information asymmetries that suppress demand for anonymisation and
identify substantial variation across demographic and electricity supply
characteristics. Qualitative responses corroborate the quantitative findings,
underscoring the need for stronger privacy defaults, user-centric design, and
consent mechanisms that enable truly informed decisions.

Abstract: This study explores how virtual environments and artificial intelligence can
enhance university students' learning experiences, with particular attention to
the digital preferences of Generation Z. An experiment was conducted at the
Faculty of Pedagogy, Humanities, and Social Sciences at University of Gyor,
where Walter's Cube technology and a trained AI mediator were integrated into
the instruction of ten philosophical topics. The curriculum was aligned with
the official syllabus and enriched with visual content, quotations, and
explanatory texts related to iconic figures in philosophy. A total of 77
first-year undergraduate students from full-time humanities and social sciences
programs participated in the study. Following their end-of-semester offline
written examination, students voluntarily completed a paper-based, anonymous
ten-question test and provided feedback on the method's effectiveness. No
sensitive personal data were collected, and the research was conducted with
formal approval from the Faculty Dean. Descriptive statistics and inferential
tests were applied to evaluate the impact of the virtual environment and AI
mediation on learning outcomes. Results indicate that 80 percent of
participants achieved good or excellent final exam grades, and the majority
rated the virtual material as highly effective. Qualitative feedback emphasized
increased motivation and deeper engagement, attributed to the immersive 3D
presentation and interactive AI support. This research contributes to the
advancement of digital pedagogy and suggests new directions for applying
virtual and AI-based methods in higher education, particularly in disciplines
where abstract reasoning and conceptual understanding are central.

Abstract: As biodiversity loss and climate change accelerate, botanical gardens serve
as vital infrastructures for research, education, and conservation. This
project focuses on the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, a 281-acre
living museum founded in 1872 in Boston. Drawing on more than a century of
curatorial data, the research combines historical analysis with computational
methods to visualize the biographies of plants and people. The resulting
platform reveals patterns of care and scientific observations, along with the
collective dimensions embedded in botanical data. Using techniques from
artificial intelligence, geospatial mapping, and information design, the
project frames the arboretum as a system of shared agency--an active archive of
more-than-human affinities that records the layered memory of curatorial labor,
the situated nature of knowledge production, and the potential of design to
bridge archival record and future care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具身AI技术的快速发展，其在物理世界中可能带来的各种风险被政策制定者严重忽视，现有政策框架无法充分应对EAI带来的独特挑战，需要紧急制定针对性政策。

Method: 首先建立了EAI风险的分类学框架，然后分析了美国、欧盟和英国的政策框架，识别现有政策如何应对这些风险以及存在的关键缺口。

Result: 发现现有工业机器人国际标准和自动驾驶汽车法规等政策不足以全面应对EAI风险，存在显著的政策缺口。

Conclusion: 提出了具体的政策建议，包括对EAI系统实施强制测试和认证、明确责任框架，以及制定前瞻性战略来管理EAI带来的经济和社会变革性影响。

Abstract: The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI
can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. Given
recent innovations in large language and multimodal models, along with
increasingly advanced and responsive hardware, EAI systems are rapidly growing
in capabilities and operational domains. These advances present significant
risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, and
economic and societal disruption. However, these risks have been severely
overlooked by policymakers. Existing policies, such as international standards
for industrial robots or statutes governing autonomous vehicles, are
insufficient to address the full range of concerns. While lawmakers are
increasingly focused on AI, there is now an urgent need to extend and adapt
existing frameworks to account for the unique risks of EAI. To help bridge this
gap, this paper makes three contributions: first, we provide a foundational
taxonomy of key physical, informational, economic, and social EAI risks.
Secondly, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to identify how existing
frameworks address these risks and where these policies leave critical gaps. We
conclude by offering concrete policy recommendations to address the coming wave
of EAI innovation, including mandatory testing and certification for EAI
systems, clarified liability frameworks, and forward-looking strategies to
manage and prepare for transformative economic and societal impacts.

### [534] [Scaling Legal AI: Benchmarking Mamba and Transformers for Statutory Classification and Case Law Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00141)
*Anuraj Maurya*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文首次对Mamba状态空间模型与主流Transformer模型在法规分类和判例检索任务上进行全面基准测试，结果显示Mamba的线性扩展能力能够处理比Transformer长数倍的法律文档，同时保持或超越检索和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着法规语料库和司法判决的快速增长，需要能够处理极长上下文的可扩展法律AI系统。当前主导法律NLP基准的Transformer架构面临二次注意力成本问题，限制了效率和可扩展性。

Method: 在开源法律语料库（LexGLUE、EUR-Lex、ILDC）上评估模型，涵盖法规标记、司法结果预测和案例检索任务。使用准确率、召回率、平均倒数排名、标准化折损累积增益等指标，同时测量吞吐量和最大上下文长度。

Result: Mamba的线性扩展能力使其能够处理比Transformer长数倍的法律文档，同时在检索和分类性能上保持或超越Transformer模型。研究还引入了新的法律NLP长上下文建模基准套件。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了状态空间模型与Transformer之间的权衡，为在法规分析、司法决策支持和政策研究中部署可扩展法律AI提供了指导。Mamba模型在处理长法律文档方面展现出显著优势。

Abstract: The rapid growth of statutory corpora and judicial decisions requires
scalable legal AI systems capable of classification and retrieval over
extremely long contexts. Transformer-based architectures (e.g., Longformer,
DeBERTa) dominate current legal NLP benchmarks but struggle with quadratic
attention costs, limiting efficiency and scalability. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive benchmarking of Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) with
linear-time selective mechanisms, against leading transformer models for
statutory classification and case law retrieval. We evaluate models on
open-source legal corpora including LexGLUE, EUR-Lex, and ILDC, covering
statutory tagging, judicial outcome prediction, and case retrieval tasks.
Metrics include accuracy, recall at k, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and
normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), alongside throughput measured in
tokens per second and maximum context length. Results show that Mamba's linear
scaling enables processing of legal documents several times longer than
transformers, while maintaining or surpassing retrieval and classification
performance. This study introduces a new legal NLP benchmark suite for
long-context modeling, along with open-source code and datasets to support
reproducibility. Our findings highlight trade-offs between state-space models
and transformers, providing guidance for deploying scalable legal AI in
statutory analysis, judicial decision support, and policy research.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨生成式AI在教育中培养学生批判性思维的能力，通过让学生分析、评价和修订AI生成的内容来评估其批判性思维应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI工具在教育中快速普及，但其在培养批判性思维方面的作用尚未充分探索。现有研究主要关注GAI作为特定课程的导师或完成作业的工具，而很少关注学生如何批判性评估GAI生成回答的准确性和适当性。

Method: 在计算与数据科学入门课程中设计学习活动，要求学生分析、批判和修订AI生成的解决方案，研究学生应用结构化批判性思维评估生成式AI输出的能力。

Result: 研究提供了关于学生批判性参与GAI内容的初步见解，为未来更全面的研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 生成式AI工具经常产生上下文有缺陷或事实错误的答案，需要通过结构化批判性思维活动来培养学生对AI输出的评估能力，这对未来教育实践具有重要意义。

Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) tools have seen rapid adoption in educational settings,
yet their role in fostering critical thinking remains underexplored. While
previous studies have examined GAI as a tutor for specific lessons or as a tool
for completing assignments, few have addressed how students critically evaluate
the accuracy and appropriateness of GAI-generated responses. This pilot study
investigates students' ability to apply structured critical thinking when
assessing Generative AI outputs in introductory Computational and Data Science
courses. Given that GAI tools often produce contextually flawed or factually
incorrect answers, we designed learning activities that require students to
analyze, critique, and revise AI-generated solutions. Our findings offer
initial insights into students' ability to engage critically with GAI content
and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in future semesters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一套验证AI辅助温室气体排放计算系统的标准，通过三步骤方法开发了针对不同应用场景的评估标准，强调系统级评估而非逐项审查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI辅助碳足迹计算系统的普及，但缺乏统一标准和透明度，需要建立可信的验证标准来确保计算系统的严谨性和可信度。

Method: 采用三步骤方法：(1)识别需求和约束，(2)制定标准草案，(3)通过试点进行完善。识别了三种AI应用场景并分别制定验证标准。

Result: 开发了一套完整的评估标准，包括基准性能、数据质量指标、不确定性分析和透明度文档等系统级评估指标，证明可信AI系统可以构建。

Conclusion: 该评估标准为从业者、审计机构和标准制定机构提供了基础框架，有助于在可扩展性和可信度要求之间取得平衡，推动AI辅助碳足迹计算系统标准化发展。

Abstract: As organizations face increasing pressure to understand their corporate and
products' carbon footprints, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted calculation
systems for footprinting are proliferating, but with widely varying levels of
rigor and transparency. Standards and guidance have not kept pace with the
technology; evaluation datasets are nascent; and statistical approaches to
uncertainty analysis are not yet practical to apply to scaled systems. We
present a set of criteria to validate AI-assisted systems that calculate
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for products and materials. We implement a
three-step approach: (1) Identification of needs and constraints, (2) Draft
criteria development and (3) Refinements through pilots. The process identifies
three use cases of AI applications: Case 1 focuses on AI-assisted mapping to
existing datasets for corporate GHG accounting and product hotspotting,
automating repetitive manual tasks while maintaining mapping quality. Case 2
addresses AI systems that generate complete product models for corporate
decision-making, which require comprehensive validation of both component tasks
and end-to-end performance. We discuss the outlook for Case 3 applications,
systems that generate standards-compliant models. We find that credible AI
systems can be built and that they should be validated using system-level
evaluations rather than line-item review, with metrics such as benchmark
performance, indications of data quality and uncertainty, and transparent
documentation. This approach may be used as a foundation for practitioners,
auditors, and standards bodies to evaluate AI-assisted environmental assessment
tools. By establishing evaluation criteria that balance scalability with
credibility requirements, our approach contributes to the field's efforts to
develop appropriate standards for AI-assisted carbon footprinting systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI技术快速发展带来了偏见、危害性、版权侵权等伦理风险，而现有的AI评估方法主要关注性能和准确性，无法涵盖这些多面性问题。

Method: 识别了评估生成式AI伦理和可信质的关键维度，并为每个维度开发了详细的指标和评估方法；还进行了韩国、美国、欧盟和中国AI伦理政策的比较分析。

Result: 建立了一个统一的评估框架，能够在AI生命周期全过程应用，并结合技术评估和多学科视角，为识别和管理实际中的伦理风险提供实用方法。

Conclusion: 这一研究为负责任的生成式AI发展奠定了学术基础，为政策制定者、开发者、用户等利益相关方提供了可操作的见解，支持AI技术做出积极的社会贡献。

Abstract: This study provides an in_depth analysis of the ethical and trustworthiness
challenges emerging alongside the rapid advancement of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for their
systematic evaluation. While generative AI, such as ChatGPT, demonstrates
remarkable innovative potential, it simultaneously raises ethical and social
concerns, including bias, harmfulness, copyright infringement, privacy
violations, and hallucination. Current AI evaluation methodologies, which
mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these
multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new
human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it
identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of
generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy,
accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual
property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators
and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative
analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United
States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications
from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and
integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby
offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world
contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the
responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for
policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the
positive societal contributions of AI technologies.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在招聘决策中存在显著的自偏好偏见，倾向于选择自己生成的简历而非人类撰写的简历，这种偏见在模拟招聘流程中导致使用相同LLM的候选人获得23%-60%的短名单优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具广泛应用，LLMs在决策过程中同时参与求职者和雇主双方，需要实证评估LLMs自偏好偏见在现实世界中的影响，特别是在招聘场景中

Method: 采用大规模受控简历对应实验，测试主要商业和开源LLMs对简历的偏好，并模拟24个职业的真实招聘流程来评估劳动力市场影响

Result: LLMs一致偏好自己生成的简历而非人类或其他模型生成的简历，自偏好偏见达到68%-88%。在模拟招聘中，使用相同LLM的候选人比提交人类撰写简历的同等资质申请人获得23%-60%的短名单优势

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI辅助决策中一个新兴但被忽视的风险，呼吁扩展AI公平性框架，不仅要解决基于人口统计的差异，还要解决AI-AI交互中的偏见问题

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools become widely adopted, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly involved on both sides of
decision-making processes, ranging from hiring to content moderation. This dual
adoption raises a critical question: do LLMs systematically favor content that
resembles their own outputs? Prior research in computer science has identified
self-preference bias -- the tendency of LLMs to favor their own generated
content -- but its real-world implications have not been empirically evaluated.
We focus on the hiring context, where job applicants often rely on LLMs to
refine resumes, while employers deploy them to screen those same resumes. Using
a large-scale controlled resume correspondence experiment, we find that LLMs
consistently prefer resumes generated by themselves over those written by
humans or produced by alternative models, even when content quality is
controlled. The bias against human-written resumes is particularly substantial,
with self-preference bias ranging from 68% to 88% across major commercial and
open-source models. To assess labor market impact, we simulate realistic hiring
pipelines across 24 occupations. These simulations show that candidates using
the same LLM as the evaluator are 23% to 60% more likely to be shortlisted than
equally qualified applicants submitting human-written resumes, with the largest
disadvantages observed in business-related fields such as sales and accounting.
We further demonstrate that this bias can be reduced by more than 50% through
simple interventions targeting LLMs' self-recognition capabilities. These
findings highlight an emerging but previously overlooked risk in AI-assisted
decision making and call for expanded frameworks of AI fairness that address
not only demographic-based disparities, but also biases in AI-AI interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在各领域的广泛应用，确保其符合伦理、法律和技术标准的需求日益迫切。可审计性作为独立评估AI系统合规性的能力，需要通过监管框架和标准化实践来实现。

Method: 通过分析新兴监管框架（如欧盟AI法案）的要求，探讨文档化、风险评估和治理结构等可审计性要素，识别技术不透明、标准化工具缺乏等挑战。

Result: 识别了AI可审计性面临的多重挑战，包括技术复杂性、文档实践不一致、审计工具和指标标准化不足，以及现有责任AI框架中的原则冲突。

Conclusion: 可审计性必须嵌入AI开发实践和治理基础设施中，需要清晰的指南、统一的国际法规、强大的社会技术方法，以及多方利益相关者协作和审计师赋权，才能构建有效的AI审计生态系统。

Abstract: Auditability is defined as the capacity of AI systems to be independently
assessed for compliance with ethical, legal, and technical standards throughout
their lifecycle. The chapter explores how auditability is being formalized
through emerging regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, which mandate
documentation, risk assessments, and governance structures. It analyzes the
diverse challenges facing AI auditability, including technical opacity,
inconsistent documentation practices, lack of standardized audit tools and
metrics, and conflicting principles within existing responsible AI frameworks.
The discussion highlights the need for clear guidelines, harmonized
international regulations, and robust socio-technical methodologies to
operationalize auditability at scale. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the
importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and auditor empowerment in
building an effective AI audit ecosystem. It argues that auditability must be
embedded in AI development practices and governance infrastructures to ensure
that AI systems are not only functional but also ethically and legally aligned.

Abstract: Reliable access to food is a basic requirement in any sustainable society.
However, achieving food security for all is still a challenge, especially for
poor populations in urban environments. The project Feed4Food aims to use a
federation of Living Labs of urban agriculture in different countries as a way
to increase urban food security for vulnerable populations.
  Since different Living Labs have different characteristics and ways of
working, the vision is that the knowledge obtained in individual Living Labs
can be leveraged at the federation level through federated learning. With this
specific goal in mind, a dashboarding tool is being established.
  In this work, we present a reusable process for establishing a dashboard that
supports local awareness and decision making, as well as federated learning.
The focus is on the first steps of this creation, i.e., defining what data to
collect (through the creation of Key Performance Indicators) and how to
visualize it. We exemplify the proposed process with the Feed4Food project and
report on our insights so far.

Result: GPT-4模型表现最佳，达到87%相关性和100%对齐度，框架能够同时扮演个性化主题推荐器和内容生成器的双重角色

Conclusion: 该适应性培训框架为四次工业革命教育和工作力发展提供了可扩展的个性化学习解决方案

Abstract: The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)
systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older
workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation,
artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and
up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds,
learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while
ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential
learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework
that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is
benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We
demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic
QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated
cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with
manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses
are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4,
assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best
performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode
approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic
recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid,
tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.

Method: 构建包含掌握度、覆盖度、保持率、进度、波动性和耐久性等6个信号的组合指数，并形式化公理和数学性质

Result: 证明了指数的单调性、Lipschitz稳定性、有界偏移性质，以及在凸约束下最优线性组合的存在性和唯一性

Conclusion: 提供了一个理论上可靠的考试准备度评估框架，为实践应用奠定了数学基础，实验研究需进一步开展

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for an Exam Readiness Index (ERI): a
composite, blueprint-aware score R in [0,100] that summarizes a learner's
readiness for a high-stakes exam while remaining interpretable and actionable.
The ERI aggregates six signals -- Mastery (M), Coverage (C), Retention (R),
Pace (P), Volatility (V), and Endurance (E) -- each derived from a stream of
practice and mock-test interactions. We formalize axioms for component maps and
the composite, prove monotonicity, Lipschitz stability, and bounded drift under
blueprint re-weighting, and show existence and uniqueness of the optimal linear
composite under convex design constraints. We further characterize confidence
bands via blueprint-weighted concentration and prove compatibility with
prerequisite-admissible curricula (knowledge spaces / learning spaces). The
paper focuses on theory; empirical study is left to future work.

*Yiluo Wei,Jiahui He,Gareth Tyson*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 首次对直播平台中的'反串'行为进行实证研究，这是一种新型的间接网络攻击行为，通过伪装支持后实施攻击来损害目标实体的声誉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反串行为作为一种新型隐蔽的网络反社会行为，具有战略性的长期目标，与传统攻击行为不同，给内容审核带来新的挑战，需要深入理解和应对。

Method: 基于Bilibili平台的270万场直播会话和36亿条聊天消息数据，识别出13万例反串行为实例，并进行多维度分析。

Result: 在37.4万场直播会话中发现了反串行为，研究提供了对这种行为及其实施者的重要洞察。

Conclusion: 反串行为是网络环境中需要重视的新型恶意行为，本研究为其识别和治理提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Recently, a distinct form of online antisocial behavior, known as "fanchuan",
has emerged across online platforms, particularly in livestreaming chats.
Fanchuan is an indirect attack on a specific entity, such as a celebrity, video
game, or brand. It entails two main actions: (i) individuals first feign
support for the entity, and exhibit this allegiance widely; (ii) they then
engage in offensive or irritating behavior, attempting to undermine the entity
by association. This deceptive conduct is designed to tarnish the reputation of
the target and/or its fan community. Fanchuan is a novel, covert and indirect
form of social attack, occurring outside the targeted community (often in a
similar or broader community), with strategic long-term objectives. This
distinguishes fanchuan from other types of antisocial behavior and presents
significant new challenges in moderation. We argue it is crucial to understand
and combat this new malicious behavior. Therefore, we conduct the first
empirical study on fanchuan behavior in livestreaming chats, focusing on
Bilibili, a leading livestreaming platform in China. Our dataset covers 2.7
million livestreaming sessions on Bilibili, featuring 3.6 billion chat
messages. We identify 130k instances of fanchuan behavior across 37.4k
livestreaming sessions. Through various types of analysis, our research offers
valuable insights into fanchuan behavior and its perpetrators.

*Deepika Dash,Yeshil Bangera,Mithil Bangera,Gouthami Vadithya,Srikant Panda*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统性的可访问性基准测试框架，用于评估LLM在九个残疾类别上的包容性表现，发现当前模型在视力、听力和行动障碍方面表现较好，但在言语、遗传/发育、感官认知和心理健康方面存在明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在可访问性指导方面存在服务不均的问题，许多残疾群体没有得到充分的服务，需要系统性的评估框架来识别和解决这些包容性差距。

Method: 开发了一个经过人工验证的通用可访问性问题基准测试，从三个维度评估模型：问题覆盖广度、残疾类别覆盖平衡性和支持深度，并应用于17个专有和开源模型。

Result: 研究发现LLM在视力、听力和行动障碍方面覆盖较好，但在言语、遗传/发育、感官认知和心理健康方面服务不足，支持深度也集中在少数类别。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前LLM可访问性指导中的服务差距，提出了基于分类的提示/训练方法和联合评估广度、平衡性和深度的行动方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for accessibility
guidance, yet many disability groups remain underserved by their advice. To
address this gap, we present taxonomy aligned benchmark1 of human validated,
general purpose accessibility questions, designed to systematically audit
inclusivity across disabilities. Our benchmark evaluates models along three
dimensions: Question-Level Coverage (breadth within answers), Disability-Level
Coverage (balance across nine disability categories), and Depth (specificity of
support). Applying this framework to 17 proprietary and open-weight models
reveals persistent inclusivity gaps: Vision, Hearing, and Mobility are
frequently addressed, while Speech, Genetic/Developmental, Sensory-Cognitive,
and Mental Health remain under served. Depth is similarly concentrated in a few
categories but sparse elsewhere. These findings reveal who gets left behind in
current LLM accessibility guidance and highlight actionable levers:
taxonomy-aware prompting/training and evaluations that jointly audit breadth,
balance, and depth.

*Chengyuan Yao,Yunxuan Tang,Christopher Brooks,Rene F. Kizilcec,Renzhe Yu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究表明，在数据分布变化（协变量偏移和概念偏移）的情况下，增加历史数据训练窗口可能反而降低模型性能和公平性，挑战了"数据越多越好"的传统观念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在数据分布随时间变化的情况下，扩展历史数据训练窗口如何影响预测模型的性能和算法公平性，验证"更多历史数据能提升模型性能"这一常见假设的局限性。

Method: 采用模拟研究分析不同协变量偏移和概念偏移程度的情景，并进行实证案例研究，使用美国23所少数族裔服务社区学院12年的学生保留预测数据。

Result: 无分布偏移时，延长训练窗口能提升性能但很快达到平台期；概念偏移存在时性能可能下降；协变量偏移单独影响不大但会复杂化概念偏移的影响。公平性方面，当概念偏移程度在不同社会人口群体间差异时，模型会产生更多偏见预测。

Conclusion: 需要谨慎使用历史数据，特别是在可能存在数据分布偏移的情况下，以改善模型性能和公平性，不应盲目遵循"数据越多越好"的传统智慧。

Abstract: Predictive models are typically trained on historical data to predict future
outcomes. While it is commonly assumed that training on more historical data
would improve model performance and robustness, data distribution shifts over
time may undermine these benefits. This study examines how expanding historical
data training windows under covariate shifts (changes in feature distributions)
and concept shifts (changes in feature-outcome relationships) affects the
performance and algorithmic fairness of predictive models. First, we perform a
simulation study to explore scenarios with varying degrees of covariate and
concept shifts in training data. Absent distribution shifts, we observe
performance gains from longer training windows though they reach a plateau
quickly; in the presence of concept shift, performance may actually decline.
Covariate shifts alone do not significantly affect model performance, but may
complicate the impact of concept shifts. In terms of fairness, models produce
more biased predictions when the magnitude of concept shifts differs across
sociodemographic groups; for intersectional groups, these effects are more
complex and not simply additive. Second, we conduct an empirical case study of
student retention prediction, a common machine learning application in
education, using 12 years of student records from 23 minority-serving community
colleges in the United States. We find concept shifts to be a key contributor
to performance degradation when expanding the training window. Moreover, model
fairness is compromised when marginalized populations have distinct data
distribution shift patterns from their peers. Overall, our findings caution
against conventional wisdom that "more data is better" and underscore the
importance of using historical data judiciously, especially when it may be
subject to data distribution shifts, to improve model performance and fairness.

TL;DR: 研究探索大学生如何使用ChatGPT和提示框架来写作文献综述，发现提示框架能提升输出质量，但学生并未充分利用所有元素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI工具已被广泛用于学术写作，但缺乏结构化训练来教学生如何有效使用这些工具写作文献综述

Method: 收集大学生在接触CO-STAR、POSE和Sandwich三种提示框架前后的提示和文献综述，进行对比分析

Result: 接触提示框架后学生的提示行为改善，产出更有效的提示和更高质量的文献综述，但学生并未充分利用所有框架元素，原创性、批判分析和深度仍需改进

Conclusion: 提示框架的完整使用对最大化输出质量至关重要，以及学生在使用GenAI前应具备的写作经验程度是重要考虑因素

Abstract: Writing literature reviews is a common component of university curricula, yet
it often poses challenges for students. Since generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI) tools have been made publicly accessible, students have
been employing them for their academic writing tasks. However, there is limited
evidence of structured training on how to effectively use these GenAI tools to
support students in writing literature reviews. In this study, we explore how
university students use one of the most popular GenAI tools, ChatGPT, to write
literature reviews and how prompting frameworks can enhance their output. To
this aim, prompts and literature reviews written by a group of university
students were collected before and after they had been introduced to three
prompting frameworks, namely CO-STAR, POSE, and Sandwich. The results indicate
that after being exposed to these prompting frameworks, the students
demonstrated improved prompting behaviour, resulting in more effective prompts
and higher quality literature reviews. However, it was also found that the
students did not fully utilise all the elements in the prompting frameworks,
and aspects such as originality, critical analysis, and depth in their reviews
remain areas for improvement. The study, therefore, raises important questions
about the significance of utilising prompting frameworks in their entirety to
maximise the quality of outcomes, as well as the extent of prior writing
experience students should have before leveraging GenAI in the process of
writing literature reviews. These findings are of interest for educators
considering the integration of GenAI into academic writing tasks such as
literature reviews or evaluating whether to permit students to use these tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于推理复杂度的中文-英文越狱安全基准，将15种越狱攻击方法按复杂度分为三个等级，系统评估大语言模型的安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全评估方法主要关注内容维度或简单聚合不同攻击方法，缺乏对复杂度的考量。不同复杂度的指令能反映模型不同的安全能力：简单指令反映基本价值观，复杂指令反映处理深层安全风险的能力。

Method: 首先量化"推理复杂度"作为可评估的安全维度，将15种越狱攻击方法按推理复杂度分为三个等级，建立分层的中英文越狱安全基准。同时提出了中文特有的越狱攻击方法，包括汉字拆解攻击、灯谜攻击和藏头诗攻击。

Result: 实验表明当前的大语言模型和大推理模型在不同推理复杂度下表现出不同的安全边界。

Conclusion: 这为开发更安全的大语言模型和大推理模型提供了新的视角，通过复杂度分层的安全评估能更好地理解模型的安全边界。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread recognition for their
superior comprehension and have been deployed across numerous domains. Building
on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) ideology, Large Reasoning models (LRMs) further
exhibit strong reasoning skills, enabling them to infer user intent more
accurately and respond appropriately. However, both LLMs and LRMs face the
potential safety risks under jailbreak attacks, which raise concerns about
their safety capabilities. Current safety evaluation methods often focus on the
content dimensions, or simply aggregate different attack methods, lacking
consideration of the complexity. In fact, instructions of different complexity
can reflect the different safety capabilities of the model: simple instructions
can reflect the basic values of the model, while complex instructions can
reflect the model's ability to deal with deeper safety risks. Therefore, a
comprehensive benchmark needs to be established to evaluate the safety
performance of the model in the face of instructions of varying complexity,
which can provide a better understanding of the safety boundaries of the LLMs.
Thus, this paper first quantifies "Reasoning Complexity" as an evaluable safety
dimension and categorizes 15 jailbreak attack methods into three different
levels according to the reasoning complexity, establishing a hierarchical
Chinese-English jailbreak safety benchmark for systematically evaluating the
safety performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, to fully utilize unique language
characteristics, we first propose some Chinese jailbreak attack methods,
including the Chinese Character Disassembly attack, Lantern Riddle attack, and
Acrostic Poem attack. A series of experiments indicate that current LLMs and
LRMs show different safety boundaries under different reasoning complexity,
which provides a new perspective to develop safer LLMs and LRMs.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个爱尔兰动态微观模拟模型，用于模拟2022-2057年的人口动态和个体生命历程变迁，包括生育、死亡、迁移等事件，能够进行精细化地方分析和政策评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够模拟爱尔兰人口动态的微观模拟模型，为学术研究和基于证据的政策制定提供工具，支持长期规划和战略决策。

Method: 基于经验数据建立随机转移概率模型，模拟个体的年龄、性别、婚姻状况、教育水平和经济状态等核心属性的演变，并在选举分区级别进行空间分解。

Result: 模型在人口规模和结构上与人口组分法高度匹配；预测教育水平将显著提高，近70%的年轻人将获得高等教育学位；失业率预计将因教育水平提高而减少近一半。

Conclusion: 该微观模拟模型是一个多功能的工具，能够为爱尔兰直至2057年的人口动态和社会经济变化提供可靠的预测，支持政策制定和学术研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic microsimulation model developed for Ireland,
designed to simulate key demographic processes and individual life-course
transitions from 2022 to 2057. The model captures four primary events: births,
deaths, internal migration, and international migration, enabling a
comprehensive examination of population dynamics over time. Each individual in
the simulation is defined by five core attributes: age, sex, marital status,
highest level of education attained, and economic status. These characteristics
evolve stochastically based on transition probabilities derived from empirical
data from the Irish context. Individuals are spatially disaggregated at the
Electoral Division level. By modelling individuals at this granular level, the
simulation facilitates in-depth local analysis of demographic shifts and
socioeconomic outcomes under varying scenarios and policy assumptions. The
model thus serves as a versatile tool for both academic inquiry and
evidence-based policy development, offering projections that can inform
long-term planning and strategic decision-making through 2057. The
microsimulation achieves a close match in population size and makeup in all
scenarios when compared to Demographic Component Methods. Education levels are
projected to increase significantly, with nearly 70% of young people projected
to attain a third level degree at some point in their lifetime. The
unemployment rate is projected to nearly half as a result of the increased
education levels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和AI智能体的快速发展，代理工作流在教育领域展现出变革潜力，需要从传统的线性交互转向更动态、协作的工作模式。

Method: 基于von Neumann多智能体系统架构，提出四组件AWE模型（自我反思、工具调用、任务规划、多智能体协作），并通过数学测试生成的案例研究验证效果。

Result: AWE生成的数学测试题目与真实考试题目在统计上具有可比性，验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: AWE为减轻教师工作负担、提高教学质量、推动更广泛的教育创新提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) agents, agentic workflows are showing transformative
potential in education. This study introduces the Agentic Workflow for
Education (AWE), a four-component model comprising self-reflection, tool
invocation, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration. We distinguish AWE
from traditional LLM-based linear interactions and propose a theoretical
framework grounded in the von Neumann Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture.
Through a paradigm shift from static prompt-response systems to dynamic,
nonlinear workflows, AWE enables scalable, personalized, and collaborative task
execution. We further identify four core application domains: integrated
learning environments, personalized AI-assisted learning, simulation-based
experimentation, and data-driven decision-making. A case study on automated
math test generation shows that AWE-generated items are statistically
comparable to real exam questions, validating the model's effectiveness. AWE
offers a promising path toward reducing teacher workload, enhancing
instructional quality, and enabling broader educational innovation.

Motivation: 研究AI对假新闻的影响，尤其是生成式AI在新闻生产和媒体组织中的快速发展带来的挑战

Method: 采用定量研究方法，对巴斯克地区504名记者进行结构化问卷调查，包括社会人口学和职业变量以及对AI态度的问题

Result: 89.88%记者认为AI会大幅增加假新闻风险；经验丰富的记者风险感知更高；主要风险包括检测假内容困难、深度假照和获取错误数据

Conclusion: 记者对AI在信息生态中的作用存在复杂而多面的担忧，尤其是关于假新闻风险的增长，这些发现强调了记者行业面临的挑战

Abstract: This study examines journalists' perceptions of the impact of artificial
intelligence (AI) on disinformation, a growing concern in journalism due to the
rapid expansion of generative AI and its influence on news production and media
organizations. Using a quantitative approach, a structured survey was
administered to 504 journalists in the Basque Country, identified through
official media directories and with the support of the Basque Association of
Journalists. This survey, conducted online and via telephone between May and
June 2024, included questions on sociodemographic and professional variables,
as well as attitudes toward AI's impact on journalism. The results indicate
that a large majority of journalists (89.88%) believe AI will considerably or
significantly increase the risks of disinformation, and this perception is
consistent across genders and media types, but more pronounced among those with
greater professional experience. Statistical analyses reveal a significant
association between years of experience and perceived risk, and between AI use
and risk perception. The main risks identified are the difficulty in detecting
false content and deepfakes, and the risk of obtaining inaccurate or erroneous
data. Co-occurrence analysis shows that these risks are often perceived as
interconnected. These findings highlight the complex and multifaceted concerns
of journalists regarding AI's role in the information ecosystem.

Motivation: 研究维基百科在学术环境中被系统性拒绝的现象，挑战传统学术来源相对于维基百科的不成比例的可信度，揭示认识论偏见和科学出版结构危机的影响。

Method: 通过分析维基百科的验证机制和传统学术出版的局限性，进行理论论证和比较分析，探讨学术引用规范中的偏见问题。

Result: 发现维基百科的可靠性经常被低估，而传统学术来源尽管存在明显缺陷却享有过高的可信度，这种排斥源于过时的认识论框架。

Conclusion: 学术界对维基百科的拒绝反映了需要更新的认识论观念，应当更客观地评估不同信息源的价值，同时认识到科学出版体系本身存在的结构性问题。

Abstract: Wikipedia, a widely successful encyclopedia recognized in academic circles
and used by both students and professors alike, has led educators to question
whether it can be cited as an information source, given its widespread use for
this very purpose. The dilemma quickly emerged: if Wikipedia has become the
go-to information source for so many, why can't it be cited? If consulting and
using Wikipedia as a source of information is permitted, why does it become
controversial the moment one attempts to cite it? This manuscript examines the
systematic rejection of Wikipedia in academic settings, not to argue for its
legitimacy as a source, but to demonstrate that its reliability is often
underestimated while traditional academic sources enjoy disproportionate
credibility, despite their increasingly apparent shortcomings. The central
thesis posits that Wikipedia's rejection stems from an outdated epistemological
bias that overlooks both the project's verification mechanisms and the
structural crises affecting scientific publishing.
