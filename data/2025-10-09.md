### [1] [Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06229)
*Josh Hunter,John McDermid,Simon Burton,Poppy Fynes,Mia Dempster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于里程碑确定的方法来生成铁路自动化所需的序列数据集，通过关注路线特定的上下文线索，简化学习过程并提高系统安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铁路自动化领域缺乏高质量序列数据，传统数据集缺乏时空上下文，替代方案存在真实性和适用性问题。

Method: 采用里程碑确定的概念，开发基于规则的目标模型，专注于路线上的关键决策点，而非动态组件的通用识别。

Result: 能够生成与真实世界操作逻辑更一致的丰富序列数据集，为在可控环境中训练视觉代理提供实用框架。

Conclusion: 该方法为铁路自动化机器学习系统提供了更安全、更高效的训练框架，通过简化学习过程提升系统性能。

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

### [2] [CML-Bench: A Framework for Evaluating and Enhancing LLM-Powered Movie Scripts Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06231)
*Mingzhe Zheng,Dingjie Song,Guanyu Zhou,Jun You,Jiahao Zhan,Xuran Ma,Xinyuan Song,Ser-Nam Lim,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CML-Bench基准测试，用于评估LLM生成的电影剧本质量，并开发了CML-Instruction提示策略来提升LLM的剧本生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在生成结构化文本方面表现出色，但在创作需要情感深度和微妙叙事技巧的电影剧本时存在不足，缺乏电影艺术的'灵魂'。

Method: 首先构建了CML-Dataset数据集，包含高质量电影剧本片段及其摘要；然后基于对真实剧本的分析确定了三个关键评估维度：对话连贯性、角色一致性和情节合理性；最后提出了CML-Instruction提示策略来指导LLM生成更好的剧本。

Result: CML-Bench能够有效区分人类创作的高质量剧本和LLM生成的剧本，并识别LLM的弱点。使用CML-Instruction指导的LLM能够生成更高质量的剧本，结果与人类偏好一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和改进LLM在电影剧本生成方面的能力提供了有效的基准测试和指导方法，证明了结构化指导策略能够显著提升LLM生成剧本的质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

### [3] [User to Video: A Model for Spammer Detection Inspired by Video Classification Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06233)
*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Yucai Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户视频化的垃圾信息发送者检测模型UVSD，将用户行为子空间视为帧图像，连续帧构成视频，结合视频分类技术识别垃圾信息发送者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受视频分类技术启发，将用户行为子空间视为帧图像，连续帧构成视频，为垃圾信息检测提供新视角。

Method: 1. 用户像素化算法(user2piexl)；2. 行为图像化算法(behavior2image)；3. 基于时序特征构建用户行为视频；4. 结合视频分类算法识别垃圾信息发送者。

Result: 在WEIBO和TWITTER公开数据集上的实验表明，UVSD模型优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: UVSD模型通过用户视频化方法有效检测垃圾信息发送者，在真实数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

### [4] [Uncertainty Quantification In Surface Landmines and UXO Classification Using MC Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06238)
*Sagar Lekhak,Emmett J. Ientilucci,Dimah Dera,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究将蒙特卡洛Dropout集成到微调的ResNet-50架构中，用于地表地雷和未爆弹药的分类，通过不确定性量化提高预测可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定性神经网络在嘈杂条件和对抗性攻击下容易出错，可能导致漏检或误分类，这在人道主义扫雷行动中具有严重后果。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛Dropout方法集成到微调的ResNet-50架构中，在模拟数据集上进行测试，量化认知不确定性。

Result: 在干净、对抗性扰动和嘈杂测试图像上的实验结果表明，该模型能够在挑战性条件下标记不可靠的预测。

Conclusion: 该概念验证研究强调了扫雷中不确定性量化的重要性，提高了对现有神经网络在扫雷中对抗性威胁脆弱性的认识，并强调了为实际应用开发更稳健可靠模型的重要性。

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

### [5] [multimodars: A Rust-powered toolkit for multi-modality cardiac image fusion and registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06241)
*Anselm W. Stark,Marc Ilic,Ali Mokhtari,Pooya Mohammadi Kazaj,Christoph Graeni,Isaac Shiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: multimodars是一个用于多模态冠状动脉成像融合的开源工具包，专门针对多状态分析（静息/应激、支架植入前后）设计，具有确定性对齐算法和优化的Rust后端。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合互补的成像模态对于构建可靠的3D冠状动脉模型至关重要：血管内成像提供亚毫米分辨率但缺乏完整血管上下文，而冠状动脉CT血管成像提供3D几何形状但受限于空间分辨率和伪影。现有方法缺乏专门针对多状态分析的开源、灵活工具包。

Method: 采用确定性对齐算法，基于NumPy的紧凑数据模型，以及优化的Rust后端，支持CSV/NumPy输入格式，包括AIVUS-CAA软件生成的数据。

Result: 开发了一个适合可扩展、可重复实验的工具包，提供高性能和易于管道集成的解决方案。

Conclusion: multimodars填补了现有工具在冠状动脉多模态融合分析方面的空白，为多状态分析提供了确定性、高性能的开源解决方案。

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D
coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from
limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work
demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is
tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while
offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline
integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment
algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend
suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy
inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

### [6] [Does Physics Knowledge Emerge in Frontier Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06251)
*Ieva Bagdonaviciute,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现前沿视觉语言模型在物理动力学理解和预测方面存在局限，感知能力和物理推理能力未能有效结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在物理模拟任务中的表现，探究其感知与物理推理能力的结合程度。

Method: 在三个物理模拟数据集上测试六个前沿VLM，设计诊断子测试分离感知和物理推理能力。

Result: 模型在感知或物理推理上的优势并不总能转化为预测或反事实评估的更好表现，两者相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 当前VLM的感知和物理技能呈现碎片化，未能形成因果理解，需要更紧密绑定感知与推理的架构。

Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

### [7] [Enhanced Self-Distillation Framework for Efficient Spiking Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06254)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Chengting Yu,Kairong Yu,Lei Liu,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强的自蒸馏框架，结合基于速率的反向传播，用于高效训练脉冲神经网络(SNN)，在降低训练复杂度的同时实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SNN训练方法存在性能落后于人工神经网络(ANN)、计算和内存开销随时间维度线性增长的问题，需要在高性能SNN训练与有限计算资源之间取得平衡。

Method: 将中间SNN层的发放率投影到轻量级ANN分支上，利用模型自身生成的高质量知识通过ANN路径优化子结构，并将教师信号解耦为可靠和不可靠组件，仅使用可靠知识指导模型优化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、CIFAR10-DVS和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，该方法在降低训练复杂度的同时实现了高性能SNN训练。

Conclusion: 所提出的增强自蒸馏框架有效解决了SNN训练中的计算效率问题，为资源受限环境下的高性能SNN训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

### [8] [Ensemble Deep Learning and LLM-Assisted Reporting for Automated Skin Lesion Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06260)
*Sher Khan,Raz Muhammad,Adil Hussain,Muhammad Sajjad,Muhammad Rashid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的皮肤病AI诊断框架，通过异构神经网络集成和嵌入式语言模型，解决现有系统的诊断可靠性和沟通障碍问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前皮肤病诊断存在观察者间变异性和获取不平等问题，现有AI系统受限于同质架构、肤色数据集偏见，以及将自然语言处理作为事后解释而非临床决策核心的碎片化方法。

Method: 1) 使用架构多样的卷积神经网络异构集成，提供互补诊断视角，内置不确定性机制标记不一致病例；2) 将大语言模型能力直接嵌入诊断工作流，将分类输出转化为临床有意义的评估。

Result: 该框架生成结构化报告，包含精确病变特征描述、可理解的诊断推理和可行的监测指导，弥合了先前AI实施未能达到临床影响的关键转化差距。

Conclusion: 该框架代表了可部署皮肤病AI的重要进展，在提高诊断精度的同时，从初始检测到患者教育全程支持，最终提高皮肤病变的早期干预率。

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

### [9] [Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06273)
*Divyansh Srivastava,Andrzej Niedzielski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用Vision Transformer模型对LIGO数据中的瞬态噪声进行分类，将22个现有类别和O3a运行中的2个新类别进行分类，达到92.26%的分类效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIGO数据中的瞬态噪声（毛刺）会阻碍引力波的探测，随着O3运行增加了两个新的噪声类别，需要训练新模型进行有效分类。

Method: 在结合了Gravity Spy数据集和LIGO O3a运行中两个新类别的数据集上，训练预训练的Vision Transformer（ViT-B/32）模型。

Result: 实现了92.26%的分类效率，证明Vision Transformer在有效区分瞬态噪声方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: Vision Transformer模型能够提高引力波探测的准确性，通过有效区分瞬态噪声来改善探测效果。

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.
  Key words: gravitational waves --vision transformer --machine learning

### [10] [General and Efficient Visual Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning using Object-Agnostic Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06277)
*Fahim Shahriar,Cheryl Wang,Alireza Azimi,Gautham Vasan,Hany Hamed Elanwar,A. Rupam Mahmood,Colin Bellinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码的目标表示方法，用于目标导向强化学习，该方法使用对象无关的视觉线索，实现了高效学习和优秀泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标表示方法（如目标状态图像、3D坐标、one-hot向量）存在泛化能力差、收敛慢、需要特殊摄像头等问题，需要更好的目标表示系统。

Method: 使用掩码作为目标表示，通过处理掩码生成密集奖励而无需距离计算，在仿真中使用真实掩码进行训练，并利用预训练的开源词汇对象检测模型生成掩码。

Result: 在训练和未见测试对象上达到了99.9%的到达准确率，能够高精度执行拾取任务而不使用目标位置信息，并成功实现了从零学习和仿真到实物的迁移应用。

Conclusion: 掩码目标表示方法在目标导向强化学习中表现出色，提供了高效学习、优秀泛化和实用的仿真到实物迁移能力。

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

### [11] [Improving the Spatial Resolution of GONG Solar Images to GST Quality Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06281)
*Chenyang Li,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Bo Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于GAN的超分辨率方法，将GONG的低分辨率Hα全日面图像增强至接近BBSO/GST高分辨率观测的质量，有效恢复太阳黑子半影和细丝/纤维结构的细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率太阳成像对捕捉细丝和纤维等精细动态特征至关重要，但现有GONG的Hα全日面图像空间分辨率不足，无法解析这些小尺度结构。

Method: 使用Real-ESRGAN模型，采用残差中的残差密集块和相对判别器，对GONG-GST图像对进行精心对齐，实现超分辨率重建。

Result: 模型有效恢复了太阳黑子半影内的精细细节，并解析了细丝和纤维的细微结构，平均MSE为467.15，RMSE为21.59，交叉相关为0.7794。

Conclusion: 图像对之间的轻微不对齐限制了定量性能，未来工作将解决对齐问题并扩展数据集以进一步提高重建质量。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

### [12] [ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating Relation Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06292)
*Yike Wu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainMPQ是一种无需训练的方法，通过多视角问题和图像-文本交错链来减少大型视觉语言模型中的关系幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在关系推理方面存在严重的关系幻觉问题，这类幻觉在三种幻觉类型中占比最大但关注最少，影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: ChainMPQ首先从问题中提取主体和客体关键词来增强相应图像区域，然后构建关注关系三个核心组件（主体、客体和关系）的多视角问题，通过文本和视觉记忆形成交错链进行渐进式关系推理。

Result: 在多个大型视觉语言模型和基准测试上的实验表明，ChainMPQ显著减少了关系幻觉，消融研究验证了其三个核心模块的有效性。

Conclusion: ChainMPQ通过利用累积的文本和视觉记忆，有效提升了大型视觉语言模型的关系推理能力，为解决关系幻觉问题提供了有效的训练免费方案。

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

*Young D. Kwon,Abhinav Mehrotra,Malcolm Chadwick,Alberto Gil Ramos,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobilePicasso是一个高效的高分辨率图像编辑系统，通过三阶段方法在移动设备上实现4K图像编辑，显著降低计算成本和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在资源受限设备上进行高分辨率图像编辑时面临内存和图像质量的挑战，需要开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 标准分辨率下使用幻觉感知损失进行图像编辑；2) 潜在投影避免进入像素空间；3) 自适应上下文保持分块将编辑后的图像潜在表示上采样到更高分辨率。

Result: 用户研究表明，MobilePicasso比现有方法提高图像质量18-48%，减少幻觉14-51%，实现高达55.8倍的加速，仅增加9%的运行内存，在设备上运行速度甚至快于A100 GPU上的服务器模型。

Conclusion: MobilePicasso成功解决了移动设备上高分辨率图像编辑的挑战，在保持高质量的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

### [14] [RGBD Gaze Tracking Using Transformer for Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06298)
*Tobias J. Bauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文实现了一个基于RGBD图像的AI视线追踪系统，使用Transformer架构融合特征，并在三个数据集上评估了不同模型配置的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集要么缺乏深度信息，要么只包含不适合视线角度估计的标签，因此需要创建新数据集并研究RGBD图像与Transformer结合的方法。

Method: 使用基于Lian等人工作的AI模型架构，采用GAN去除深度图伪影并提取头部姿态特征，同时引入Transformer模块进行特征融合。

Result: 在ShanghaiTechGaze+数据集上，带Transformer模块的模型平均欧几里得误差为55.3mm，不使用预训练GAN模块降至30.1mm，用MLP替换Transformer后进一步降至26.9mm。在ETH-XGaze数据集上，带Transformer模块的平均角度误差为3.59°，不带Transformer为3.26°。

Conclusion: Transformer模块在视线追踪任务中表现不如预期，使用MLP替代Transformer能获得更好的性能，表明简单的特征融合方法可能更适合此任务。

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm
on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to
a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are
coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the
model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and

*Tiago de Conto,John Armston,Ralph Dubayah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合GEDI激光雷达和SAR数据的深度学习框架，用于生成全球25米分辨率森林结构复杂性连续地图，实现了高精度预测和不确定性校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GEDI激光雷达的稀疏采样限制了高分辨率连续制图，需要结合多模态SAR数据来实现全球范围的森林结构复杂性连续监测。

Method: 采用改进的EfficientNetV2架构，融合GEDI激光雷达观测和多模态SAR数据，训练超过1.3亿个GEDI足迹，参数量少于40万。

Result: 模型达到全球R²=0.82的高性能，能够准确预测并校准不确定性，生成2015-2022年全球多时相森林结构复杂性数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架支持全球森林结构动态的连续多时相监测，为生物多样性保护和生态系统管理提供了有效工具，并可通过迁移学习扩展到其他森林结构变量的预测。

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFIRA是一个轻量级、无需标注的人脸图像可识别性评估框架，通过嵌入空间的几何特性直接评估可识别性，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸图像质量评估方法依赖视觉启发式、人工标注或计算密集型生成流程，其预测与编码器的决策几何特性脱节。

Method: 提出基于类中心相似度(CCS)和类中心角度分离(CCAS)的可识别性定义，开发了可识别性感知的聚合策略，无需外部标签或特定主干网络训练。

Result: 在BRIAR和IJB-C验证任务中达到最先进准确率，与真实可识别性的相关性几乎翻倍，在身体识别评估中也表现强劲。

Conclusion: TransFIRA建立了一个统一的、几何驱动的可识别性评估框架，在准确性、可解释性和跨模态扩展性方面显著推进了FIQA领域。

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,
and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,
illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络和随机森林模型，结合摄像头图像和天气数据，自动分类道路表面状况，为纽约州交通部门提供决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纽约州交通部门目前通过人工驾驶观察和实时摄像头监控来评估道路状况，这些任务劳动密集且必要。机器学习模型可以为交通部门提供自动化的道路状况分类支持。

Method: 在约22,000张人工标记的摄像头图像数据集上训练卷积神经网络和随机森林模型，将道路表面状况分为六类：严重积雪、积雪、潮湿、干燥、能见度差或被遮挡。

Result: 模型在完全未见过的摄像头图像上达到了81.5%的准确率，优先考虑了模型的泛化能力以满足交通部门决策者的操作需求。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能够有效支持交通部门自动分类道路表面状况，在冬季天气事件中为关键运营决策提供辅助。

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TDiff，一种基于patch的扩散框架，用于解决低成本热成像相机图像的低分辨率、固定模式噪声等局部退化问题，通过在小热图像patch上训练实现多任务统一恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低成本热成像相机图像存在低分辨率、固定模式噪声等局部退化问题，且现有热成像数据集在规模和多样性上都很有限。

Method: 提出patch-based扩散框架TDiff，利用局部失真的特性在小热图像patch上训练，通过去噪重叠patch并使用平滑空间窗口融合来恢复全分辨率图像。

Result: 在去噪、超分辨率和去模糊任务上的实验表明，该方法在模拟和真实热数据上均取得了强劲结果。

Conclusion: TDiff是首个基于patch的扩散框架，为热图像恢复建立了统一的多任务恢复流程。

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed
pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal
imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated
and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration
pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时实现多主体身份保留和精确的空间结构控制，需要开发统一框架来支持不同精度的用户引导。

Method: 引入SIGMA-SET27K合成数据集，提供身份、结构和空间信息；开发单模型支持从粗粒度边界框到像素级分割和深度的多级引导。

Result: 在身份保留、图像生成质量和速度方面达到最先进性能，支持多种精度级别的用户控制。

Conclusion: SIGMA-GEN首次实现了单次多主体身份保留生成，为精确可控的图像生成提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image
generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable
single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation guided by both
structural and spatial constraints. A key strength of our method is its ability
to support user guidance at various levels of precision -- from coarse 2D or 3D
boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth -- with a single model. To enable
this, we introduce SIGMA-SET27K, a novel synthetic dataset that provides
identity, structure, and spatial information for over 100k unique subjects
across 27k images. Through extensive evaluation we demonstrate that SIGMA-GEN
achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, image

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SIGRID（超像素集成网格）数据结构，在分割任务中替代全分辨率图像，通过结合颜色和形状信息显著降低输入维度，同时保持甚至超越像素级表示的准确性并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超像素虽能简化图像处理，但其不规则分布迫使深度学习使用特殊架构，违背了简化初衷。需要一种既能利用超像素效率优势，又能与标准深度学习架构兼容的方法。

Method: 开发SIGRID数据结构，利用经典形状描述符编码超像素的颜色和形状信息，大幅降低输入维度，使其能直接用于标准卷积分割架构。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上测试，使用两种流行卷积分割架构，SIGRID不仅匹配甚至在某些情况下超越像素级表示性能，同时显著加速模型训练。

Conclusion: SIGRID在准确性和计算效率之间达到了良好平衡，证明了超像素简化数据在分割任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more
efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational
potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning
approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures,
undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we
introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated
Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By
leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人-人交互建模面临两个主要挑战：1) 有限的两人训练数据无法捕捉交互的多样性；2) 文本到交互建模不够细粒度，语言条件将丰富的结构化提示压缩为单一句子嵌入。

Method: 1) InterCompose：基于组合的合成管道，将LLM生成的交互描述与强单人运动先验对齐；2) InterActor：具有词级条件的文本到交互模型，保留令牌级线索和自适应交互损失。

Result: 广泛实验显示在运动多样性、保真度和泛化能力方面取得一致提升，包括分布外场景和用户研究。

Conclusion: Text2Interact框架通过可扩展的数据合成和细粒度文本条件，显著提升了人-人交互建模的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了KeyScore多模态帧评分框架和STACFP时空自适应聚类方法，用于从长视频中选择少量关键帧，实现99%的帧减少，在多个视频理解任务上显著优于标准8帧编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解需要选择少量能保留语义和上下文信息的关键帧，以提高效率并减少计算开销。

Method: KeyScore结合语义相似性、时间多样性和上下文影响来评估帧重要性；STACFP生成紧凑多样的帧候选集。两者协同工作实现高效帧选择。

Result: 在MSRVTT、MSVD和DiDeMo数据集上，相比全帧推理实现99%的帧减少，性能显著优于标准8帧编码器。

Conclusion: 强调视觉和文本信号的多模态对齐可以实现可扩展、高效且基于字幕的视频理解，无需显式的视频摘要。

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and
caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

Motivation: 将神经网络模型（如YOLO、HuBERT）的局部检测得分提升到时间序列属性，有助于下游应用如查询匹配和排序检索。

Method: 提出LogSTOP评分函数，能够高效计算线性时序逻辑表示的时间属性得分，处理可能包含噪声的局部属性预测器。

Result: 在视频对象和语音情感的时间属性查询匹配任务中，LogSTOP比大型视觉/音频语言模型和其他时序逻辑基线至少提升16%；在视频对象和动作的排序检索任务中，比零样本文本到视频检索基线在平均精度和召回率上分别提升至少19%和16%。

Conclusion: LogSTOP方法能有效计算时间属性得分，在多个任务中显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

Motivation: 解决有限角度电子层析中的缺失楔形问题，避免传统深度学习方法对高质量3D地面实况数据的依赖。

Method: 使用FIB-SEM体积数据训练扩散模型，通过模拟器将其映射到TEM倾斜序列，直接在3D体积上操作以保持切片间一致性。

Result: 在模拟数据集上优于现有方法，在真实TEM倾斜数据上泛化良好，可在仅8度倾斜范围内重建准确结构。

Conclusion: TEMDiff提供了一种无需干净地面实况的有效重建方法，在极端有限角度条件下仍能恢复准确结构。

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VUGEN是一个新颖的视觉语言模型框架，通过利用预训练的视觉理解先验来实现高效高质量的图像生成，无需复杂的自编码器或桥接机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型虽然能统一理解文本和图像，但为其添加稳健的图像生成能力仍然具有挑战性。现有方法依赖重建导向的自编码器或复杂的桥接机制，导致理解与生成表示不对齐或架构复杂。

Method: VUGEN首先将VLM视觉编码器的高维潜在空间转换为低维可处理分布，最大化保留视觉信息。然后训练VLM在该降维潜在空间中采样，确保与其视觉理解能力对齐。最后使用专门的像素解码器将这些生成的潜在映射回图像空间。

Result: 实验表明VUGEN在图像生成方面表现优异，将DPG Bench从71.17提升到74.32，在COCO数据集上FID从11.86提升到9.06，同时完全保留了VLM原有的理解能力。

Conclusion: VUGEN通过有效利用VLM的预训练视觉理解先验，实现了理解与生成能力的统一，在保持原有理解能力的同时显著提升了图像生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding
capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出cluster paths方法，通过聚类激活值生成可解释的序列路径，用于理解深度神经网络的决策过程，并验证其在多个任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度神经网络在视觉任务中表现出色但决策过程不透明，存在信任风险、偏差检测困难和意外失败等问题，需要可解释性方法来揭示其内部工作机制。

Method: 在选定层对激活值进行聚类，将每个输入表示为聚类ID序列（cluster paths），并引入四个评估指标：路径复杂度、加权路径纯度、决策对齐忠实度和路径一致性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10虚假线索实验中识别出颜色捷径；CelebA头发颜色任务中达到90%忠实度和96%一致性；扩展到ImageNet预训练的ViT模型；可作为有效的OOD检测器。

Conclusion: cluster paths能够扩展到大型视觉模型，生成简洁且人类可读的解释，揭示多网络深度的视觉概念如调色板、纹理和对象上下文。

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

Conclusion: HSNet通过异质子图网络成功解决了图像超分辨率中的结构不灵活和计算复杂问题，在保持高质量重建的同时实现了计算效率。

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半自动化、不确定性感知的地面激光扫描点云语义分割标注流程，通过球形投影、特征增强、集成学习和针对性标注来减少标注工作量，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面激光扫描点云的手动语义分割标注成本高昂，需要开发更高效的标注方法。

Method: 将3D点云投影到2D球形网格，增强多源特征，训练分割网络集成生成伪标签和不确定性图，指导标注模糊区域，最后将2D结果反投影回3D。

Result: 性能在约12个标注扫描后饱和，几何特征贡献最大，9通道特征堆叠捕获了几乎所有判别能力，mIoU稳定在0.76左右。

Conclusion: 该流程实现了可扩展的高质量TLS点云分割，为生态监测等应用提供了实用工具和数据集。

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly
available at https://fz-rit.github.io/through-the-lidars-eye/.

*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了领域自适应方法在医学影像中处理新伪影的能力，使用领域对抗神经网络(DANN)在OrganAMNIST腹部CT数据集上成功应对环形伪影，无需对应标签即可保持分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在训练分布外的图像上性能会显著下降，特别是当CT扫描仪引入新伪影时。直接标注新分布图像成本高昂，需要寻找更经济的替代方案。

Method: 在正弦图空间模拟探测器增益误差产生的环形伪影，使用领域对抗神经网络(DANN)与基线方法和基于增强的方法进行比较。

Result: 基线模型在环形伪影图像上泛化失败，传统增强方法无效。DANN方法仅使用未标记的伪影数据就能在环形伪影测试数据上保持高分类准确率，性能与显式使用标记伪影图像训练的模型相当，并意外地泛化到均匀噪声。

Conclusion: 领域自适应能有效处理医学影像中的分布偏移，无需昂贵的新伪影分布专家标注，在临床环境中具有应用前景。

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

TL;DR: MingTok提出了一种连续潜在空间的视觉分词器，通过三阶段架构解决视觉理解与生成任务在分词需求上的冲突，实现了统一的视觉语言建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散潜在空间的分词方法存在量化误差，限制了语义表达能力并降低了视觉语言理解能力。需要一种能同时满足理解和生成任务需求的分词器。

Method: 采用三阶段序列架构：低级编码、语义扩展和视觉重建。基于此构建Ming-UniVision，在共享连续空间中将理解和生成统一为下一个token预测任务。

Result: 使用统一的连续视觉表示调和了理解和生成任务对分词器的竞争需求，在两个领域都达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 连续域的视觉分词能够有效统一视觉理解和生成任务，支持多轮上下文任务如迭代理解、生成和编辑。

Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

Conclusion: 提出的BeerLaNet模型能有效处理病理图像的颜色不一致问题，提升模型在跨域部署时的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 机器学习模型的性能严重依赖训练数据，但大规模、高质量标注数据集的稀缺性限制了模型性能。合成数据虽然能增强数据集多样性，但缺乏有效的质量评估指标。

Method: 提出了合成数据集质量指标(SDQM)，用于在不需要模型训练收敛的情况下评估目标检测任务中合成数据的质量。

Result: 实验表明SDQM与YOLOv11的mAP分数呈现强相关性，而之前的指标仅显示中等或弱相关性。该指标还能为改进数据集质量提供可操作的见解。

Conclusion: SDQM为评估合成数据质量设定了新标准，是一个可扩展且高效的指标，能够最小化昂贵的迭代训练需求。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描时间过长限制了其广泛应用，深度学习重建方法能有效缩短采集时间。在难以获取全采样数据的情况下，自监督和无监督学习方法尤为重要。

Method: 采用物理引导的展开迭代重建架构，引入隐式神经表示(INR)作为正则化先验来约束解空间，结合深度展开结构和INR的隐式表示能力。

Result: 在10倍高加速率下，UnrollINR实现了优于监督学习方法的重建性能。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了所提方法的优越性，展示了零样本自监督重建在MRI应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 当前语音驱动面部动画合成模型在英语上表现良好，但在非英语语言中效果不佳，产生错误嘴型和僵硬表情，主要原因是英语主导的训练数据集和缺乏跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 使用音素和视位作为音频和视频模态的通用中介，提出PG-MoE架构和PV-Align对齐机制，并构建包含12种语言的多语言基准数据集MTFB。

Result: MuEx在MTFB所有语言上都取得优越性能，并在未见语言上表现出有效的零样本泛化能力，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: MuEx框架通过音素-视位中介和跨模态对齐机制，成功实现了高质量的多语言面部动画合成，具有强大的跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike
facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English
but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and
rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the
English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits
effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional
training.

Motivation: 现实世界中的视觉目标跟踪面临遮挡、相似物体干扰和复杂背景等挑战，限制了RGB跟踪器的效果。多光谱图像能增强目标区分能力，但现有多光谱跟踪数据集有限。

Method: 构建MSITrack数据集，包含300个多光谱视频、129k帧图像，涵盖55个物体类别和300个自然场景。每个帧都经过精细处理、手动标注和多阶段验证以确保标注精度。

Conclusion: MSITrack数据集有潜力推动多光谱跟踪领域的未来发展，该数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges
including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex
backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers.
Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,
enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral
tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack,
the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to
date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging
Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color
and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a
wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral
data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines,
highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The

Conclusion: StaR-KVQA通过结构化推理轨迹监督显著提高了基于知识的视觉问答的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground
entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its
implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases
(KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single
autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临类内差异和类间相似性两大挑战，现有手动设计模型需要大量试错且难以有效解决这两个问题。

Method: 提出AutoNAD框架，联合搜索卷积、Transformer和MLP，采用交叉权重共享策略加速训练，集成可搜索的多级特征聚合模块，并引入延迟感知先验指导高效架构选择。

Result: 在三个工业缺陷数据集上验证了有效性，并应用于缺陷成像和检测平台。

Conclusion: AutoNAD能够有效解决表面缺陷检测的关键挑战，减少手动网络设计成本，同时保证运行效率，适合工业部署。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product
quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

Abstract: We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the
foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs \textbf{causal
attention}, \textbf{eliminates reliance on CFG}, and \textbf{eschews the trend
of semantic tokenizers}. Our key innovation is \textit{next 2D distribution
prediction}: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer,
learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at
each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of
autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked
autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via
generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an
FID of $2.70$, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive
approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language
modeling on visual signals and beyond.

generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

*Jie Luo,Yuxuan Jiang,Xin Jin,Mingyu Liu,Yihui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个融合光场数据和点云数据的多模态语义分割数据集，并开发了Mlpfseg网络，通过特征补全和深度感知模块提升复杂遮挡条件下的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶场景理解中复杂遮挡条件下的语义分割挑战，利用光场和LiDAR的互补视觉与空间线索，克服视角多样性有限和模态差异的问题。

Method: 提出Mlpfseg多模态融合分割网络，包含特征补全模块（通过点云特征图的差分重建解决密度不匹配问题）和深度感知模块（通过增强注意力分数提升遮挡感知能力）。

Result: 相比仅使用图像的分割方法提升1.71 mIoU，相比仅使用点云的分割方法提升2.38 mIoU，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能够有效提升复杂遮挡条件下的语义分割性能，为自动驾驶场景理解提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCas4D是一个用于动态场景建模的级联优化框架，利用3D高斯泼溅中的结构模式，通过从粗到细的变形优化实现高效训练和高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态场景建模中准确捕捉变形同时保持计算效率的挑战，利用现实世界变形通常呈现层次化模式的特点。

Method: 提出级联优化框架，从粗粒度的部件级变形逐步细化到细粒度的点级变形，利用高斯组共享相似变换的特性。

Result: 每个时间帧仅需100次迭代即可收敛，训练迭代次数仅为现有方法的二十分之一，结果质量相当。在自监督关节物体分割、新视角合成和密集点跟踪任务中表现有效。

Conclusion: SCas4D通过层次化变形建模实现了动态场景的高效高质量建模，显著减少了训练成本。

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view
synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

*Maria Levchenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了针对LLM历史文档OCR的评估方法，解决传统指标无法捕捉时间偏差和特定时期错误的问题，引入了历史字符保存率和古语插入率等新指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字人文学者越来越多地使用大语言模型进行历史文档数字化，但缺乏适当的评估框架来评估基于LLM的OCR系统，传统指标无法捕捉对历史语料库创建至关重要的时间偏差和特定时期错误。

Method: 使用18世纪俄文民用字体文本，引入历史字符保存率(HCPR)和古语插入率(AIR)等新指标，以及污染控制和稳定性测试协议，评估了12个多模态LLM。

Result: 发现Gemini和Qwen模型优于传统OCR，但表现出过度历史化：从错误的历史时期插入古语字符。OCR后校正反而降低了性能。

Conclusion: 该评估方法为数字人文学者在历史语料库数字化中的模型选择和质量评估提供了指导方针。

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for
historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks
for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and
period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an
evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination
risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century
Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical
Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside
protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12
multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR
while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from
incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves
performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with
guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus
digitization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeRainMamba是一个用于图像去雨的新方法，结合了频域感知状态空间模块和多方向感知卷积，在保持图像细节的同时有效去除雨纹，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mamba模型在序列建模方面效率高，但缺乏捕捉细粒度细节的能力和频域感知，限制了图像去雨效果的进一步提升。

Method: 提出DeRainMamba，集成频域感知状态空间模块(FASSM)和多方向感知卷积(MDPConv)。FASSM利用傅里叶变换区分雨纹和高频图像细节，MDPConv通过捕捉各向异性梯度特征和多分支卷积融合来恢复局部结构。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DeRainMamba在PSNR和SSIM指标上持续优于最先进方法，同时需要更少的参数和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 在状态空间框架中结合频域建模和空间细节增强对于单图像去雨是有效的，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

TL;DR: OBS-Diff是一个无需训练的一剪枝框架，专门针对大规模文本到图像扩散模型，通过改进经典OBS算法和提出时间步感知Hessian构建，实现高效压缩和推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型计算成本过高，现有的一剪枝方法难以直接应用于扩散模型，因为扩散模型具有迭代去噪的特性。

Method: 1. 改进经典OBS算法，支持多种剪枝粒度；2. 提出时间步感知Hessian构建，采用对数递减权重方案；3. 设计计算高效的组级顺序剪枝策略。

Result: 实验表明OBS-Diff在扩散模型一剪枝方面达到最先进水平，在视觉质量退化最小的情况下实现推理加速。

Conclusion: OBS-Diff成功解决了扩散模型高效压缩的挑战，为大规模文本到图像扩散模型的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种直方图匹配方法，将任意噪声转换为目标高斯分布，通过噪声转换与去噪的相互增强循环，使单一高斯去噪器能够处理各种分布外噪声。


<details>

Motivation: 监督高斯去噪器在面对分布外噪声时泛化能力有限，因为不同噪声类型具有不同的分布特征。

Method: 使用直方图匹配将任意噪声转换为已知强度的目标高斯分布，建立噪声转换与去噪的相互增强循环，采用局部直方图匹配处理信号相关噪声，帧内排列处理通道相关噪声，频域直方图匹配结合像素洗牌下采样打破空间相关性。

Result: 单一高斯去噪器获得了处理各种分布外噪声的显著能力，包括泊松噪声、椒盐噪声、重复模式噪声以及复杂的真实世界噪声。

Conclusion: 该方法通过噪声转换和去噪的协同作用，显著提高了高斯去噪器的泛化能力和有效性。

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度多示例学习的方法，使用高分辨率卫星图像和低分辨率参考数据训练土地覆盖分类器，通过灵活的池化层连接像素语义与低分辨率标签，并在多类和多标签设置下重新构建MIL问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率土地覆盖制图中训练标签数量和质量的问题，利用现有低分辨率产品获取大量弱标签数据。

Method: 使用深度多示例学习框架，通过灵活池化层连接高分辨率图像像素语义与低分辨率参考标签，在多类设置中低分辨率标注代表像素多数类别，在多标签设置中采用正未标记学习策略。

Result: 在2020 IEEE GRSS数据融合竞赛数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法相比标准训练策略具有更好的效果。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效利用弱标签数据训练高分辨率土地覆盖分类器，为缺乏高质量标注数据的场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TTRV方法，在推理时无需标注数据即可增强视觉语言理解，通过基于基础模型输出频率设计奖励信号，并在每个测试样本上进行多次推理来实现测试时强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法需要标注数据和专门训练分割，这与人类直接从环境中学习的方式形成对比。

Method: 改进GRPO框架，基于基础模型输出频率设计奖励信号，同时通过控制输出分布的熵来奖励低多样性输出，在每个测试样本上进行多次推理。

Result: 在物体识别和视觉问答任务上分别获得最高52.4%和29.8%的提升，平均提升24.6%和10.0%；在图像识别上，TTRV应用于InternVL 8B超越GPT-4o平均2.3%。

Conclusion: 测试时强化学习可以匹配或超越最强的专有模型，即使在极端数据受限场景下，仅使用单个随机选择的未标注测试样本也能获得显著改进。

Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

Motivation: 解决极端非模态检测问题，即从输入图像中推断视野外物体的2D位置，特别关注人脸检测在安全和隐私应用中的重要性。

Method: 设计基于热图的极端非模态目标检测器，利用图像中的上下文线索推断未见面部，采用选择性粗到细解码器高效预测视野外区域。

Result: 该方法在新任务上取得了强劲结果，甚至优于效率较低的生成功方法。

Conclusion: 提出的单图像样本自由方法能够有效利用上下文信息进行极端非模态检测，在效率和性能上都表现出色。

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

Conclusion: VA-Adapter成功将基础模型的医学知识迁移到探头引导任务，为初级超声医师提供了有效的实时操作指导解决方案。

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

Motivation: 多模态检索主要依赖基于嵌入的模型，但缺乏类似文本检索中的联合编码器重排器。现有联合编码器如BLIP因昂贵的视觉特征提取阶段而受限，无法在实际大规模部署。

Method: EDJE预计算视觉token并离线存储，通过轻量级注意力适配器压缩，在线推理时仅运行紧凑的联合编码器处理少量视觉token和文本。

Result: EDJE处理速度达50k图像-文本对/秒，每张图像仅需49kB磁盘存储，在Flickr（零样本）和COCO（微调）检索任务上达到先进水平。

Conclusion: EDJE通过预计算和压缩视觉token，有效解决了联合编码器在视觉-语言重排中的计算瓶颈，实现了高效的大规模多模态检索。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast
vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval,
where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

Motivation: 现有视觉提示方法存在内容泄漏问题，即视觉风格提示中不需要的内容元素会与预期风格一起被转移。

Method: 1) 扩展无分类器引导(CFG)以利用交换自注意力；2) 提出负视觉查询引导(NVQG)，通过故意模拟内容泄漏场景来交换自注意力层的查询而非键和值。

Result: 该方法在各种风格和文本提示的广泛评估中表现出优于现有方法的性能，能准确反映参考图像的风格并确保生成图像与文本提示匹配。

Conclusion: NVQG是一种简单而有效的方法，能显著减少内容泄漏，并为使用真实图像作为视觉风格提示提供了解决方案。

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we
provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.
Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method
demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the
references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code
is available \href{https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleKeeper}{here}.

Motivation: 事件相机能有效捕捉人造环境的几何特征，但现有方法要么依赖额外的帧相机，要么难以处理高事件率。本研究旨在实现仅使用现代高分辨率事件相机的实时线段检测和跟踪。

Method: 采用网格分配流水线，包括：(i) 速度不变事件表示；(ii) 基于拟合得分的线段检测；(iii) 通过端点扰动进行线段跟踪。

Result: 在专门记录的数据集和公共数据集上的评估表明，该方法实现了实时性能，并且在准确性上优于最先进的仅使用事件和事件-帧混合基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法使事件相机能够在真实世界环境中实现完全独立的实时操作。

Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of
human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to
contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant
data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event
camera operation in real-world settings.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

TL;DR: 提出在线通用事件边界检测任务(On-GEBD)，开发Estimator框架实时检测流媒体视频中的事件边界，无需未来帧信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GEBD方法需要处理完整视频帧，而人类能够在线实时处理数据，需要弥合这一差距

Method: 基于事件分割理论，提出Estimator框架，包含一致性事件预测器和在线边界判别器，通过预测未来帧与实际的差异来检测事件边界

Result: 在Kinetics-GEBD和TAPOS数据集上，Estimator优于所有在线视频理解基线，性能与离线GEBD方法相当

Conclusion: 提出的On-GEBD任务和Estimator框架成功实现了实时事件边界检测，为在线视频理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在卫星上使用原始传感器数据进行目标检测时深度学习模型的性能表现，发现原始数据训练模型在高置信度下边界识别存在困难，建议改进轮廓检测方法以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着处理能力提升，在卫星上部署AI模型变得可行，但使用原始传感器数据而非预处理数据带来了新的挑战，目前缺乏直接利用原始数据的方法。

Method: 开发了模拟工作流程从高分辨率L1图像生成原始类产品，训练YOLOv11s和YOLOX-S模型在原始和L1数据集上，使用标准检测指标和可解释性工具比较性能。

Result: 在低到中置信度阈值下两种模型表现相似，但在高置信度水平下，原始数据训练的模型在目标边界识别方面表现较差。

Conclusion: 通过改进轮廓检测方法调整AI架构可以增强原始图像上的目标检测性能，从而改进遥感星载AI系统。

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing
directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints
arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARP-NeXt是一个高速准确的LiDAR语义分割网络，通过新颖的预处理方法、Conv-SE-NeXt特征提取块和多尺度范围点融合骨干网络，在保持高精度的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LiDAR语义分割方法在精度和速度之间存在权衡：基于点和稀疏卷积的方法准确但速度慢，基于投影的方法速度快但丢失几何信息，且许多方法依赖测试时增强进一步降低推理速度。

Method: 提出新颖的预处理方法减少计算开销；设计Conv-SE-NeXt特征提取块高效捕获表示；采用多尺度范围点融合骨干网络在多个抽象级别利用信息以保留几何细节。

Result: 在nuScenes和SemanticKITTI基准测试中，HARP-NeXt实现了优于所有最先进方法的速度-精度权衡，在不依赖集成模型或测试时增强的情况下，性能与排名第一的PTv3相当，但运行速度快24倍。

Conclusion: HARP-NeXt通过创新的预处理、特征提取和融合方法，成功解决了LiDAR语义分割中精度与速度的权衡问题，为资源受限的嵌入式系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

Abstract: Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can
escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity
prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical
decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel
method applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung
infection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a
Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated
attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale
features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation
strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image
patches during training. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, RALO CXR and
Per-COVID-19 CT, our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art
deep learning models. The results emphasize the critical role of data
augmentation and gated attention in improving both robustness and predictive
accuracy. This approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical

Conclusion: 提出的主动学习方法通过生成关键虚拟范例进行高效标注，能够有效减少标注成本，同时提升变化检测算法的性能。

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

TL;DR: IAR2提出了一个先进的层次化自回归框架，通过语义-细节关联双码本将图像表示解耦为语义码本和细节码本，显著提升了生成质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型忽略了视觉数据的固有结构特性，且之前的IAR方法受限于预训练码本的刚性和硬聚类的不足。

Method: 使用语义-细节关联双码本进行层次化表示，结合语义-细节自回归预测方案和局部上下文增强自回归头，以及渐进注意力引导的自适应CFG机制。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到FID 1.50的新SOTA，不仅性能超越先前方法，还展示了优越的计算效率。

Conclusion: IAR2通过结构化的从粗到细生成策略，有效提升了自回归图像生成的表达能力和条件对齐质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

Method: 提出物理信息文本到3D对抗生成(Phy3DAdvGen)，通过系统优化文本提示（动词、对象和姿态）来生成LiDAR不可见行人。构建包含13个真实物体3D模型的对象池，约束生成过程确保物理可实现性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成物理可实现的对抗性3D物体，有效暴露LiDAR检测系统的脆弱性，为自动驾驶安全测试提供了重要工具。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

Conclusion: DirectGaussian是一个有效的方法，能够处理复杂几何形状的3D对象生成问题，并在多视角一致性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DETR的HD地图构建方法依赖独立的可学习对象查询，导致主要关注局部视角，忽略了HD地图中固有的全局表示。

Method: 提出MapGR架构，包含两个协同模块：全局表示学习模块（GRL）通过整体分割任务使查询分布与全局地图对齐；全局表示引导模块（GRG）为每个查询提供显式的全局上下文信息。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上的评估显示，与领先基线相比，平均精度（mAP）有显著提升。

Conclusion: MapGR通过学习和利用全局表示，有效提升了HD地图构建的性能，验证了全局表示在自动驾驶系统中的重要性。

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

Conclusion: RICE方法有效解锁了LVLMs的内在ID匹配能力，显著提升了长视频字幕中的身份识别准确性，为文本到视频生成和多模态理解提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

### [69] [Concept Retrieval -- What and How?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07058)
*Ori nizan,Oren Shrout,Ayellet Tal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念相似性的图像检索方法，超越传统的视觉或语义相似性，通过双峰高斯分布建模嵌入空间邻域来识别共享概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像检索方法主要关注视觉或语义相似性，但无法有效捕捉图像背后的核心概念和叙事。本文旨在检索共享相同中心概念的图像，即使它们在视觉上可能不相似。

Method: 基于两个关键观察：(1) 嵌入空间中的邻居可能与查询共享至少一个概念，但邻居之间不一定共享相同概念；(2) 使用双峰高斯分布建模邻域可以揭示有意义的结构，从而识别概念。

Result: 通过定性、定量和人工评估验证了方法的有效性，证明能够成功检索共享核心概念的图像。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效识别和检索共享相同中心概念的图像，超越了传统基于视觉或语义相似性的检索方法。

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input
image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central
concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond
conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or
semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,
and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DADO是一种结合注意力机制和深度模型的无监督对象发现方法，通过动态加权策略自适应调整注意力与深度特征的权重，在标准基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督对象发现（无需人工标注标签识别和定位图像中的对象）是计算机视觉中的重要挑战，现有方法在噪声注意力图或复杂深度场景中存在局限性。

Method: 提出DADO模型，结合注意力机制和深度模型，采用动态加权策略根据图像全局特征自适应强调注意力或深度特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，DADO在对象发现准确性和鲁棒性方面优于最先进方法，且无需微调。

Conclusion: DADO通过有效结合注意力与深度信息，为无监督对象发现提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects
in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a
growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model,
DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen
Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify
potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps
or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出CHILI方法来解决CLIP在概念瓶颈模型中的概念幻觉问题，通过解耦图像嵌入和定位目标概念的像素来抑制幻觉，生成更可解释的显著性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本概念提取中容易产生概念幻觉，错误预测图像中概念的存在或缺失，这削弱了概念瓶颈模型解释的可信度。

Method: 提出CHILI技术，通过解耦图像嵌入和定位目标概念对应的像素来抑制概念幻觉，支持生成更可解释的显著性解释。

Result: CHILI方法能够有效抑制CLIP的概念幻觉问题，提高概念预测的准确性，并生成更可靠的解释。

Conclusion: CHILI技术解决了CLIP在概念瓶颈模型中的概念幻觉问题，为可解释AI提供了更可靠的概念基础解释方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations,
relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show
that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target
concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based
explanations that are more interpretable.

TL;DR: MoRe是一种无需训练的单目几何优化方法，通过特征匹配和图优化框架提升跨视图一致性和尺度对齐，改善3D重建和新视角合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D基础模型为感知任务提供了可扩展的解决方案，但存在跨视图一致性和尺度模糊性问题，需要改进以适用于更广泛的3D视觉应用。

Method: 使用特征匹配建立帧间对应关系，采用基于图的优化框架进行局部平面近似，利用单目基础模型估计的3D点和表面法向量，解决尺度模糊性同时保持3D结构。

Result: MoRe不仅增强了3D重建质量，还改善了新视角合成效果，特别是在稀疏视图渲染场景中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费单目几何优化方法MoRe有效解决了单目几何先验的尺度模糊性问题，提升了跨视图一致性和尺度对齐，为3D视觉应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception
tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this
paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了联邦学习在医学影像中处理非独立同分布数据的能力，通过模拟不同MRI强度归一化方法创建异构数据，发现联邦学习在脑肿瘤分割任务中表现稳健，达到92%的3D Dice分数，与集中式模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在医学影像中面临的数据隐私、存储和传输挑战，同时应对非独立同分布数据对联邦学习效果的影响。

Method: 通过应用不同的MRI强度归一化技术创建非独立同分布数据子集，用于脑肿瘤分割模型的联邦学习训练和测试。

Result: 联邦学习方法对客户端间不一致归一化数据表现出韧性，3D Dice分数达到92%，与使用所有数据的集中式模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是有效训练高性能模型而不违反数据隐私的解决方案，在医疗应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散概率模型在噪声潜在空间中操作，缺乏语义结构和强先验，难以在医学图像等敏感领域实现有意义的受控生成，而医学图像的结构特征对诊断至关重要。

Method: 生成对应图像主要结构的图节点，捕捉个体特征和关系，通过transformer模块处理图表示，并利用文本条件机制集成到扩散模型中，实现细粒度生成控制。

Result: 在真实组织病理学用例中评估，证明生成的数据可以可靠地替代标注的患者数据用于下游分割任务。

Conclusion: 图条件扩散方法能够有效解决医学图像生成中的结构控制问题，为敏感领域的受控生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new
standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains
challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于评估遥感视觉语言模型在少样本学习场景下适应能力的结构化基准测试，通过10个遥感场景分类数据集和5种少样本适应策略对3个先进RSVLM模型进行综合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然遥感视觉语言模型在大规模预训练后展现出强大的零样本性能，但它们在少样本学习等低数据场景下的泛化能力尚未得到充分探索，需要系统性的评估基准。

Method: 在10个遥感场景分类数据集上，对3个不同骨干网络的先进RSVLM模型应用5种广泛使用的少样本适应策略，进行全面的实验评估。

Result: 研究发现，具有相似零样本性能的模型在少样本适应下表现出显著不同的行为，某些RSVLM模型天生更适合这种适应。现有方法的性能存在较大差异，没有明确的优胜者。

Conclusion: 需要开发更鲁棒的专门针对遥感领域的少样本适应方法。作者提供了可复现的基准测试框架和开源代码，以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable
potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot
performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data
regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this
work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot
adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a
reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically
evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions. The source code is publicly

Conclusion: 需要专门设计的评估框架来准确评估视觉令牌压缩方法，VTC-Bench通过数据过滤机制解决了现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness
of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an
evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise
existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of
visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at

TL;DR: MV-Performer是一个用于从单目全身捕捉生成同步新视角视频的创新框架，专注于以人为中心的360度新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成方法主要集中于前视视角的相机轨迹重定向，难以生成360度视角变化。本文专注于以人为中心的子领域，旨在解决从单目视频生成同步多视角视频的挑战。

Method: 利用MVHumanNet数据集，使用从定向部分点云渲染的相机相关法线图作为信息条件信号，提出多视角以人为中心的视频扩散模型，融合参考视频、部分渲染和不同视角的信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，MV-Performer在效果和鲁棒性方面达到最先进水平，为以人为中心的4D新视角合成建立了强大模型。

Conclusion: MV-Performer通过创新的框架设计，成功实现了从单目视频生成同步360度新视角视频，在人类中心4D新视角合成领域取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and
diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as
implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily
concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while
struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on
human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for
creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To
achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel
view synthesis.

*Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh,Mina Shaigan,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在胸部X光图像分析中，DINOv3自监督学习模型在512x512分辨率下表现最佳，优于DINOv2和ImageNet初始化。ConvNeXt-B骨干网络优于ViT-B/16，而更高分辨率(1024x1024)未带来额外收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估自监督学习(SSL)在胸部X光图像分析中的价值，特别是Meta的DINOv3模型是否比早期SSL模型和ImageNet初始化在胸部放射学中表现更好。

Method: 在7个数据集(n>814,000)上对比DINOv3、DINOv2和ImageNet初始化，使用ViT-B/16和ConvNeXt-B两种骨干网络，在224x224、512x512和1024x1024三种分辨率下评估。

Result: 在512x512分辨率下，DINOv3表现优于DINOv2和ImageNet；ConvNeXt-B始终优于ViT-B/16；更高分辨率(1024x1024)未带来额外收益；冻结的7B模型特征表现不如完全微调的模型。

Conclusion: 512x512分辨率是胸部X光图像分析的实用上限，DINOv3初始化的ConvNeXt-B网络提供最强性能，对边界依赖和小病灶异常的检测增益最明显。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

TL;DR: 提出EigenScore方法，利用扩散模型后验协方差矩阵的特征值谱进行OOD检测，在近OOD场景下表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型能够捕捉复杂数据分布，但现有基于扩散的OOD检测方法在近OOD场景下表现不佳，需要更可靠的分布偏移信号

Method: 通过分析扩散模型后验协方差矩阵的特征值谱，发现OOD输入会产生更大的迹和主导特征值；采用无雅可比子空间迭代法估计主导特征值

Result: EigenScore在OOD检测上达到SOTA性能，AUROC比最佳基线提升5%，在CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100等近OOD场景下保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: 后验协方差矩阵提供了可靠的分布偏移信号，EigenScore方法在OOD检测中表现出色，特别是在具有挑战性的近OOD场景下

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像合成方法在处理复杂长提示时存在语义不一致和细节缺失问题，而现有的自动提示优化方法缺乏系统性的错误分析和优化策略，测试时缩放方法也缺乏可解释性和适应性。

Method: 提出GenPilot多代理系统，包含错误分析、基于聚类的自适应探索、细粒度验证和记忆模块，实现迭代优化的测试时提示优化策略。

Result: 在DPG-bench和Geneval数据集上分别实现了16.9%和5.7%的提升，显著增强了文本与图像的一致性和结构连贯性。

Conclusion: GenPilot提供了一种模型无关、可解释的测试时提示优化方法，能够有效处理复杂长提示，并总结了常见错误模式和优化策略。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately
interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting
in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis
and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.
Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and
image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the
effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the
cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech
videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in
controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal
learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病黄斑水肿是导致糖尿病患者视力丧失的主要原因，深度学习在自动检测方面有潜力但面临标注数据有限的问题，基础模型作为替代方案但其在DME检测中的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 系统比较RETFound和FLAIR两种视网膜图像基础模型与EfficientNet-B0主干网络，在不同训练机制和评估设置下在IDRiD、MESSIDOR-2和OEFI数据集上进行测试。

Result: 基础模型在大多数评估设置中未能持续优于微调CNN，EfficientNet-B0在ROC和精确率/召回率曲线下面积方面排名第一或第二，RETFound仅在OEFI中表现良好，FLAIR在零样本设置下表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: 基础模型可能不是细粒度眼科任务（如DME检测）的良好工具，即使在微调后也是如此，轻量级CNN在数据稀缺环境中仍是强基线。

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

*Inzamamul Alam,Md Tanvir Islam,Khan Muhammad,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecGuard是一种新颖的鲁棒隐形图像水印方法，通过将信息嵌入隐藏的卷积层，从空间域转换到频域，使用小波分解的高频带进行频谱投影，增强了对各种攻击的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法缺乏对各种变换的鲁棒性，包括失真、图像再生和对抗性扰动，这在现实应用中造成了挑战。

Method: 通过频谱投影将空间数据高效转换为频域，在编码阶段使用强度因子增强对多种攻击的抵抗力，解码器利用Parseval定理有效学习和提取水印模式。

Result: 综合实验表明，SpecGuard在嵌入水印的不可见性、容量和鲁棒性方面优于最先进的模型。

Conclusion: SpecGuard提供了一种鲁棒且不可见的图像水印解决方案，能够有效保护版权信息，并在各种挑战性变换下保持准确性。

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视频DiT模型在表示多实例和主体-对象交互方面的局限性，提出了MATRIX-11K数据集和MATRIX正则化方法，通过注意力对齐增强交互建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频DiT模型在多实例或主体-对象交互建模方面存在困难，需要深入理解模型内部如何表示交互关系。

Method: 构建MATRIX-11K数据集，包含交互感知的标注和多实例掩码轨迹；提出MATRIX正则化方法，在特定层对齐注意力与掩码轨迹；设计InterGenEval评估协议。

Result: MATRIX方法提高了交互保真度和语义对齐，减少了漂移和幻觉现象；发现交互效应集中在少数交互主导层中。

Conclusion: 通过注意力对齐的简单正则化方法能有效增强视频DiT模型的交互建模能力，为理解模型内部表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

*Zezhong Qian,Xiaowei Chi,Yuming Li,Shizun Wang,Zhiyuan Qin,Xiaozhu Ju,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WristWorld是首个仅从锚点视角生成腕部视角视频的4D世界模型，通过几何重建和视频生成两阶段方法，解决了腕部视角数据稀缺的问题，显著提升了视觉语言动作模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腕部视角观测对于VLA模型至关重要，能捕捉精细的手-物交互，但大规模数据集很少包含此类记录，导致锚点视角和腕部视角之间存在巨大差距。现有世界模型无法仅从锚点视角生成腕部视角视频。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 重建阶段：扩展VGGT并引入空间投影一致性损失，估计几何一致的腕部视角姿态和4D点云；2) 生成阶段：使用视频生成模型从重建视角合成时序连贯的腕部视角视频。

Result: 在Droid、Calvin和Franka Panda数据集上的实验显示，WristWorld实现了最先进的视频生成效果，具有优越的空间一致性，同时提升了VLA性能：在Calvin上将平均任务完成长度提高了3.81%，并缩小了42.4%的锚点-腕部视角差距。

Conclusion: WristWorld成功解决了腕部视角数据稀缺的问题，通过几何重建和视频生成的方法，仅从锚点视角就能生成高质量的腕部视角视频，显著提升了视觉语言动作模型的性能表现。

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

TL;DR: 提出Pixel-Perfect Depth模型，通过像素空间扩散生成实现无飞点的高质量单目深度估计，避免了VAE压缩带来的边缘伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Stable Diffusion的深度估计模型需要VAE将深度图压缩到潜在空间，这会在边缘和细节处引入飞点伪影。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1) 直接在像素空间进行扩散生成，避免VAE引入的伪影；2) 提出语义提示扩散变换器(SP-DiT)，结合视觉基础模型的语义表示来提示扩散过程；3) 采用级联DiT设计，逐步增加token数量以提高效率和精度。

Result: 在五个基准测试中达到所有已发布生成模型的最佳性能，在边缘感知点云评估中显著优于其他所有模型。

Conclusion: 像素空间扩散生成能够有效解决VAE压缩导致的飞点问题，结合语义提示和级联设计可以同时保证全局语义一致性和细粒度细节，实现高质量的深度估计。

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Motivation: 现有经典方法在某些场景下无法在合理时间内找到解决方案或只能计算近似解，量子计算可为多类问题提供更好的时间可扩展性优势。

Method: 开发与量子硬件兼容的专门算法，利用基于门的量子计算和量子退火两大主要量子计算范式，研究参数化量子电路作为经典神经网络替代方案。

Conclusion: QeCV具有改变视觉信号处理方式的潜力，但需要开发专门的新算法来充分发挥量子计算范式在计算机视觉中的优势，并面临开放挑战和社会影响问题。

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to
publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social
implications.

TL;DR: 提出Tenet框架，利用现有基础分割模型，通过时间提示生成与选择来高效解决参考视频对象分割问题，避免端到端训练的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参考视频对象分割方法需要端到端训练和密集掩码标注，计算成本高且扩展性差。本文旨在探索该任务的关键因素，并利用基础模型实现高效适配。

Method: 将RVOS任务分解为参考、视频和分割三个因素，提出时间提示生成与选择框架。使用现成目标检测器和跟踪器生成时间提示，并通过提示偏好学习评估提示质量。

Result: 在RVOS基准测试中证明了Tenet框架的有效性，能够产生高质量的参考对象掩码。

Conclusion: Tenet框架通过利用基础分割模型和时间提示机制，实现了对参考视频对象分割任务的高效适配，避免了昂贵的端到端训练。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.
Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet
framework.

Motivation: 传统机器学习分类器开发周期长，缺乏对内容的深度、细微理解，无法满足短视频推荐系统对内容"氛围"等微妙属性的理解需求。

Method: 端到端工作流包括：(1)迭代定义和评估目标属性；(2)利用多模态特征和优化推理进行大规模离线批量标注；(3)将丰富标注集成到在线推荐系统中。

Result: LLM在微妙属性标注质量上超越人工标注者，在线A/B测试显示用户参与度和满意度显著提升。

Conclusion: LLM生成的细微理解能够有效增强内容发现、用户满意度和现代推荐系统的整体效能，展示了生产级LLM管道的设计和扩展潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a case study on deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) as
an advanced "annotation" mechanism to achieve nuanced content understanding
(e.g., discerning content "vibe") at scale within a large-scale industrial
short-form video recommendation system. Traditional machine learning
classifiers for content understanding face protracted development cycles and a
lack of deep, nuanced comprehension. The "LLM-as-annotators" approach addresses
these by significantly shortening development times and enabling the annotation
of subtle attributes. This work details an end-to-end workflow encompassing:
(1) iterative definition and robust evaluation of target attributes, refined by
offline metrics and online A/B testing; (2) scalable offline bulk annotation of
video corpora using LLMs with multimodal features, optimized inference, and
knowledge distillation for broad application; and (3) integration of these rich
annotations into the online recommendation serving system, for example, through
personalized restrict retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of this approach, with LLMs outperforming human raters in offline annotation
quality for nuanced attributes and yielding significant improvements of user
participation and satisfied consumption in online A/B tests. The study provides
insights into designing and scaling production-level LLM pipelines for rich
content evaluation, highlighting the adaptability and benefits of LLM-generated
nuanced understanding for enhancing content discovery, user satisfaction, and
the overall effectiveness of modern recommendation systems.

Motivation: 传统LLM评估主要关注标注正确性，但本文旨在探索LLM是否能像人类一样进行主观判断，并评估其在群体中的统计不可区分性。

Method: 开发了基于Krippendorff's α、配对自举法和TOST等价性检验的统计评估方法，测试LLM是否能融入人类标注者群体而不被区分。

Result: 在MovieLens 100K数据集上LLM与人类标注者统计不可区分(p=0.004)，但在PolitiFact数据集上可区分(p=0.155)，显示任务依赖性差异。

Conclusion: 该方法能在少量人类数据上进行早期评估，判断LLM是否适合特定应用的大规模标注任务。

Abstract: Many evaluations of large language models (LLMs) in text annotation focus
primarily on the correctness of the output, typically comparing model-generated
labels to human-annotated ``ground truth'' using standard performance metrics.
In contrast, our study moves beyond effectiveness alone. We aim to explore how
labeling decisions -- by both humans and LLMs -- can be statistically evaluated
across individuals. Rather than treating LLMs purely as annotation systems, we
approach LLMs as an alternative annotation mechanism that may be capable of
mimicking the subjective judgments made by humans. To assess this, we develop a
statistical evaluation method based on Krippendorff's $\alpha$, paired
bootstrapping, and the Two One-Sided t-Tests (TOST) equivalence test procedure.
This evaluation method tests whether an LLM can blend into a group of human
annotators without being distinguishable.
  We apply this approach to two datasets -- MovieLens 100K and PolitiFact --
and find that the LLM is statistically indistinguishable from a human annotator
in the former ($p = 0.004$), but not in the latter ($p = 0.155$), highlighting
task-dependent differences. It also enables early evaluation on a small sample
of human data to inform whether LLMs are suitable for large-scale annotation in
a given application.

Method: 采用激活修补的因果可解释性方法，在信息检索领域应用该框架，并扩展了词频公理分析。

Result: 验证了Chen等人的主要发现，成功识别出编码词频递减效应的注意力头组，揭示了神经排序模型不仅捕获词频信息，还能将这些表征定位到特定组件。

Conclusion: 因果干预框架能有效揭示神经检索模型的内部计算机制，特定注意力头确实编码了检索公理，为理解模型决策提供了新视角。

Abstract: Neural ranking models have shown outstanding performance across a variety of
tasks, such as document retrieval, re-ranking, question answering and
conversational retrieval. However, the inner decision process of these models
remains largely unclear, especially as models increase in size. Most
interpretability approaches, such as probing, focus on correlational insights
rather than establishing causal relationships. The paper 'Axiomatic Causal
Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval
Models' by Chen et al. addresses this gap by introducing a framework for
activation patching - a causal interpretability method - in the information
retrieval domain, offering insights into how neural retrieval models compute
document relevance. The study demonstrates that neural ranking models not only
capture term-frequency information, but also that these representations can be
localized to specific components of the model, such as individual attention
heads or layers. This paper aims to reproduce the findings by Chen et al. and
to further explore the presence of pre-defined retrieval axioms in neural IR
models. We validate the main claims made by Chen et al., and extend the
framework to include an additional term-frequency axiom, which states that the
impact of increasing query term frequency on document ranking diminishes as the
frequency becomes higher. We successfully identify a group of attention heads
that encode this axiom and analyze their behavior to give insight into the
inner decision-making process of neural ranking models.

Conclusion: 提出的LLM-based方法在自动术语抽取任务中表现优异，为下游NLP任务提供了更鲁棒和可扩展的解决方案，并发布了数据集和模型以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) is a critical component in downstream NLP
tasks such as document tagging, ontology construction and patent analysis.
Current state-of-the-art methods require expensive human annotation and
struggle with domain transfer, limiting their practical deployment. This
highlights the need for more robust, scalable solutions and realistic
evaluation settings. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark
spanning seven diverse domains, enabling performance evaluation at both the
document- and corpus-levels. Furthermore, we propose a robust LLM-based model
that outperforms both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot
learning baselines and performs competitively with its GPT-4o teacher on this
benchmark. The first step of our approach is generating psuedo-labels with this
black-box LLM on general and scientific domains to ensure generalizability.
Building on this data, we fine-tune the first LLMs for ATE. To further enhance
document-level consistency, oftentimes needed for downstream tasks, we
introduce lightweight post-hoc heuristics. Our approach exceeds previous
approaches on 5/7 domains with an average improvement of 10 percentage points.
We release our dataset and fine-tuned models to support future research in this
area.

Abstract: With the increasing use of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), strong
retrieval models have become more important than ever. In healthcare,
multimodal retrieval models that combine information from both text and images
offer major advantages for many downstream tasks such as question answering,
cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal summarization, since medical data often
includes both formats. However, there is currently no standard benchmark to
evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this
gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark.
M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over
1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under
approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this
benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities
and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing
M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation,
and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal

Motivation: 传统PINN训练需要平衡多个损失项（如PDE残差和边界条件），这些损失项往往目标冲突且曲率差异巨大，导致训练困难。现有方法采用'预组合'策略存在根本局限性。

Method: 提出'后组合'训练范式AutoBalance，为每个损失分量分配独立的自适应优化器，然后聚合经过预处理的更新结果。

Result: 在具有挑战性的PDE基准测试中，AutoBalance始终优于现有框架，在MSE和L∞范数下均显著降低了解误差。

Conclusion: AutoBalance是一种正交且互补的方法，能够增强其他流行PINN方法在要求苛刻基准测试中的有效性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a powerful and general
framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by embedding
physical laws into loss functions. However, training PINNs is notoriously
difficult due to the need to balance multiple loss terms, such as PDE residuals
and boundary conditions, which often have conflicting objectives and vastly
different curvatures. Existing methods address this issue by manipulating
gradients before optimization (a "pre-combine" strategy). We argue that this
approach is fundamentally limited, as forcing a single optimizer to process
gradients from spectrally heterogeneous loss landscapes disrupts its internal
preconditioning. In this work, we introduce AutoBalance, a novel "post-combine"
training paradigm. AutoBalance assigns an independent adaptive optimizer to
each loss component and aggregates the resulting preconditioned updates
afterwards. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that
AutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks, achieving significant
reductions in solution error, as measured by both the MSE and $L^{\infty}$
norms. Moreover, AutoBalance is orthogonal to and complementary with other
popular PINN methodologies, amplifying their effectiveness on demanding
benchmarks.

*Khartik Uppalapati,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Bora Yimenicioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RareGraph-Synth是一个基于知识图谱引导的连续时间扩散框架，用于生成真实且保护隐私的超罕见疾病电子健康记录轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超罕见疾病研究中数据稀缺和隐私保护的问题，通过生成合成数据来促进研究，同时保护患者隐私。

Method: 整合五个公共资源构建异质知识图谱，使用元路径分数调节扩散模型的前向噪声计划，引导生成生物合理的医疗数据序列。

Result: 相比无引导扩散基线，分类最大均值差异降低40%；相比GAN方法降低超过60%；在成员推理攻击中AUROC为0.53，低于安全发布阈值0.55。

Conclusion: 将生物医学知识图谱直接集成到扩散噪声计划中，可以同时提高数据保真度和隐私保护能力，为罕见疾病研究实现更安全的数据共享。

Abstract: We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion
framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic
electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.
RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph
comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this
8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward
stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically
plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining
score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces
timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag
triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated
ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean
Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by
greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream
predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the
DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55
safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61
plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong
resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating
biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can
simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for
rare-disease research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MCCE框架，结合冻结的闭源大语言模型和轻量可训练模型，通过协同进化解决多目标离散优化问题，在药物设计基准测试中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化算法容易陷入局部最优，而专家知识对加速收敛至关重要。闭源LLM虽探索能力强但无法更新参数，开源小模型可微调但缺乏广泛知识和推理能力。

Method: MCCE框架联合冻结闭源LLM和轻量可训练模型，维护搜索过程轨迹记忆，通过强化学习逐步优化小模型，两模型在全局探索中相互支持和补充。

Result: 在多目标药物设计基准测试中，MCCE实现了最优的帕累托前沿质量，持续超越基线方法。

Conclusion: MCCE为混合LLM系统提供了一种持续进化的新范式，结合了知识驱动探索和经验驱动学习。

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design,
pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial
spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima,
while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating
convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning
ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However,
closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their
parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open
models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning
strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid
framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable
model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the
small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two
models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration.
Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both
models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design
benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and
consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for
enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven
exploration with experience-driven learning.

Conclusion: RVFL-X通过将复数组件集成到随机向量功能链接网络中，成功提升了模型性能，为复数在随机神经网络中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical
insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers.
However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited
due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular
datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we
propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from
real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven
method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued
extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X
integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining
the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging
complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X
processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.
Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that
RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art
(SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse
application domains.

Abstract: Analytics play an important role in modern business. Companies adapt data
science lifecycles to their culture to seek productivity and improve their
competitiveness among others. Data science lifecycles are fairly an important
contributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data
science and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are
involved in a project. A typical life cycle states that it is a linear or
cyclical model that revolves around. It is mostly depicted that it is possible
in a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after
reaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate
data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new
technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility,
agility and iterative approach to business processes.

Conclusion: 这种两阶段方法突显了机器学习处理噪声视觉数据与不变量强制执行严格拓扑区分之间的互补性，为稳健的绳结分类提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

Conclusion: transformer架构在轨迹生成任务中优于传统卷积方法，能够更好地保持轨迹的精细细节并减少生成偏差。

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data
mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and
generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and
privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for
high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on
convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the
diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of
fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper,
we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer
backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We
explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and
longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different
scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory
Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively
alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

Motivation: 解决现有降水临近预报方法中存在的归纳偏差问题、推理速度慢以及扩散模型计算成本高的问题，需要开发既准确又高效的实时预报模型。

Method: 提出BlockGPT模型，采用批量标记化方法，在每个时间步预测完整的二维降水场。模型通过帧内自注意力和帧间因果注意力分解时空关系。

Result: 在KNMI和SEVIR两个降水数据集上的实验表明，BlockGPT在准确性、事件定位和推理速度方面均优于现有基线模型，推理速度比可比基线快达31倍。

Conclusion: BlockGPT作为一种模型无关的视频预测范式，在降水临近预报任务中表现出色，为实时天气预测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling
task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term
precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only
accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current
methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed
inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be
computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT,
a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block)
method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step.
Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT
factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal
attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation
nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI
(Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines
including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet)
models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event
localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x
faster than comparable baselines.

TL;DR: SDAR提出了一种协同扩散-自回归范式，将自回归模型的训练效率与扩散模型的并行推理能力相结合，通过轻量级范式转换实现高效AR到扩散模型的转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统扩散模型训练成本高的问题，同时保持自回归模型的训练效率优势，并实现并行生成能力。

Method: 将训练好的自回归模型通过数据高效的轻量适应转换为块级扩散模型，在推理时跨块自回归生成以保证全局一致性，块内通过离散扩散过程并行解码所有token。

Result: SDAR在保持自回归模型性能水平的同时实现并行生成，30B MoE模型在GPQA和ChemBench等科学推理基准上超越其AR对应模型，在多数投票和pass@k等测试时缩放方法下获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: SDAR建立了一个实用的范式，结合了自回归和扩散模型的优势，实现了可扩展的高吞吐量推理。

Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies
the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference
capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR
performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained
autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,
data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences
autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens
within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive
experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient
than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.
Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion
with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel
generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures
confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger
robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups
without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning
and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on
challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and
gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting
and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that
combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable,
high-throughput reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基础模型在动态环境中的局限性，提出使用分散式的小型智能体网络（SANs）架构来克服维度诅咒，实现更好的自适应决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在复杂动态系统（如重症监护）中的表现提升有限，需要开发能够在数据有限和机制知识不足情况下自适应的AI模型。

Method: 提出分散式的小型智能体网络架构，每个智能体只覆盖系统功能的子集，通过群体学习实现自适应决策。

Result: 分散式SANs在动态环境中能够提供比单一基础模型更优越的决策能力，但代价是降低了细节的可重现性。

Conclusion: 在基础模型承担更广泛决策角色之前，AI需要在动态复杂系统中证明其明确优势，分散式SANs架构是克服维度诅咒的有效途径。

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether
their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains.
The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes
such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for
daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is
diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.
Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly
interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires
reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins
of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively
understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI
models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge
extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these
settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient
self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual
limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized
architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents
representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent
covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical
results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing
applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable
self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments
compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced
reproducibility in detail.

Motivation: 无人机通信需要准确且可解释的空地信道模型，但确定性模型过于刚性，深度学习模型缺乏可解释性，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出物理启发的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(PIKAN)，将自由空间路径损耗、双射线反射等物理原理作为灵活的归纳偏置嵌入学习过程。

Result: 在无人机空地测量数据上的实验表明，PIKAN达到与深度学习模型相当的精度，同时提供符合传播定律的符号化可解释表达式，且仅需232个参数，比多层感知机轻量37倍。

Conclusion: PIKAN是5G和6G网络中无人机信道建模的高效、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet
interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to
nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer
interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both
approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge
this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN)
that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray
reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it
introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible
training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN
achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and
explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN
achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times
lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of
parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also
providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient,
interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and
6G networks.

Conclusion: 拉格朗日神经ODE能够直接学习欧拉-拉格朗日方程，在零额外推理成本下提升性能。

Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in
particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is
an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this
resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several
fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE
to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations
in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate
that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and
non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.

Motivation: 解决关系领域缺乏能够跨数据集和任务迁移的架构问题，核心挑战是关系数据的多样性，包括异构模式、图结构和函数依赖。

Method: RT通过（i）使用表/列元数据对单元格进行标记化，（ii）通过掩码标记预测进行预训练，（iii）利用新颖的关系注意力机制覆盖列、行和主外键链接。

Conclusion: RT为零样本迁移提供了实用路径，利用任务-表上下文、关系注意力模式和模式语义，为关系数据的基础模型开辟了道路。

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via
zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that
transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of
relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and
functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer
(RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and
directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific
fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with
table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and
(iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns,
rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning
tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot
performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification
tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%
for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample
efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses
task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics.
Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational
data.

TL;DR: MCPS是一种改进GRAVE算法的通用MCTS算法，适用于无法使用深度强化学习或计算资源有限的情况。通过在节点探索项中包含从根节点到该节点路径上所有移动的统计信息，MCPS在多种游戏中表现优于GRAVE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当深度强化学习不可行或计算资源有限时（如通用游戏博弈），需要一种有效的MCTS算法。GRAVE算法存在改进空间，特别是在探索项统计信息的利用方面。

Method: MCPS在节点探索项中包含了从根节点到该节点路径上所有移动的统计信息。使用抽象代码而非精确代码来改进置换统计和AMAF统计，并提供了三种统计源加权公式的数学推导。

Result: 在多种游戏（棋盘游戏、战争游戏、投资游戏、视频游戏和多人游戏）上的广泛测试表明，MCPS在所有双人游戏中表现优于GRAVE。在多人游戏中表现相当，因为这类游戏即使玩家实力不同也天然平衡。

Conclusion: MCPS是GRAVE算法的有效改进，消除了GRAVE的偏差超参数敏感性，且在ref超参数上不敏感。使用抽象代码对MCPS和GRAVE都有益，能改善统计信息质量。

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS
is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the
computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General
Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the
exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all
the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a
variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and
multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player
games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are
inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show
that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to
both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF
statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for
weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on
the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE.
Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

Motivation: 现有校准度量大多是非真实的，会激励预测器说谎以显得更校准。虽然Hartline等人提出了二元预测的完美真实度量，但多类预测领域仍缺乏类似的真实校准度量。

Result: 提出的校准度量不仅完美真实，而且在鲁棒性方面优于分箱ECE，能稳定地保持主导和被主导预测器之间的排序关系，不受超参数选择的影响。

Conclusion: 成功将真实校准度量的概念从二元预测扩展到多类预测，解决了分箱ECE的非鲁棒性问题，为多类预测提供了可靠的真实校准评估工具。

Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An
important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate
calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a
predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies
the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized
when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure
incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous
calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced
the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks
in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class
prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary
prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from
binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve
truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and
empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness:
it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors,
regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses
the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in
prior work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了非欧几里得基础模型在双曲几何中的边界驱动不对称性，这种几何特性使得后门触发器能够利用边界附近的小输入变化产生不成比例的大表示空间位移，从而规避标准输入空间检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非欧几里得基础模型在双曲几何等弯曲空间中部署表示，需要理解这些几何特性带来的安全漏洞，特别是边界驱动的非对称性如何被后门攻击利用。

Method: 通过理论分析形式化双曲几何中的边界效应，提出几何自适应触发器，并在不同任务和架构上进行实证评估，同时分析防御方法的局限性。

Result: 实证结果显示攻击成功率向边界增加，而传统检测器效果减弱，与理论趋势一致。防御方法通过沿半径向内拉回点可以抑制此类触发器，但会牺牲模型在该方向上的有用敏感性。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了非欧几里得模型特有的几何漏洞，并为设计和理解防御方法的局限性提供了基于分析的指导。

Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved
spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a
boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the
boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors
but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation
space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for
defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can
suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in
that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple
geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.
Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional
detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results
surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer
analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of
defenses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了标签噪声对深度神经网络隐藏表示的影响，发现隐藏表示的信息内容随网络参数数量呈现双下降现象，与测试误差行为类似。在欠参数化状态下，带噪声标签学习的表示比干净标签更信息丰富；在过参数化状态下，两者信息量相当，表明过参数化网络对标签噪声具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然标签噪声对深度学习模型性能的影响已被广泛研究，但其对网络隐藏表示的影响尚不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白，系统性地分析标签噪声如何影响深度网络的内部表示。

Method: 使用信息不平衡（Information Imbalance）作为条件互信息的计算高效代理，系统地比较不同参数化状态下网络的隐藏表示，分析在干净标签、噪声标签和随机标签训练下的表示特性。

Result: 发现隐藏表示的信息内容随网络参数数量呈现双下降现象；在欠参数化状态下，噪声标签学习的表示比干净标签更信息丰富；在过参数化状态下，两者信息量相当；随机标签学习的表示性能比随机特征更差。

Conclusion: 过参数化网络的表示对标签噪声具有鲁棒性；末层和softmax前层之间的信息不平衡随交叉熵损失减少；这为理解分类任务中的泛化提供了新视角；随机标签训练使网络远超惰性学习，权重适应编码标签信息。

Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for
each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to
annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep
learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden
representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically
comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a
computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this
analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations
follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,
akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the
underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more
informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the
overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our
results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are
robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the
penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the
overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding
generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to
representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse
than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives
networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels
information.

Abstract: Is bigger always better for time series foundation models? With the question
in mind, we explore an alternative to training a single, large monolithic
model: building a portfolio of smaller, pretrained forecasting models. By
applying ensembling or model selection over these portfolios, we achieve
competitive performance on large-scale benchmarks using much fewer parameters.
We explore strategies for designing such portfolios and find that collections
of specialist models consistently outperform portfolios of independently
trained generalists. Remarkably, we demonstrate that post-training a base model
is a compute-effective approach for creating sufficiently diverse specialists,
and provide evidences that ensembling and model selection are more
compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于Hellinger定位框架的新方法，用于多轨迹设置中的实例最优学习，显著扩展了现有方法的适用范围，并在四个不同案例中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习中，从时间相关数据中学习是一个核心问题，但现有方法在多轨迹设置下存在局限性，要么只能应用于最小二乘回归，要么需要依赖混合假设，无法充分利用全部数据预算。

Method: 采用Hellinger定位框架，首先在路径测度级别通过简化到i.i.d.学习来控制平方Hellinger距离，然后在参数空间中以轨迹Fisher信息加权的二次形式进行定位。

Result: 该方法在四个不同案例中（马尔可夫链混合、非高斯噪声下的依赖线性回归、非单调激活的广义线性模型、线性注意力序列模型）都获得了接近渐近正态的实例最优速率，显著优于标准简化方法。

Conclusion: Hellinger定位框架为多轨迹设置提供了广泛的实例最优保证，能够充分利用全部数据预算，在多种模型和损失函数下都表现出色。

Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine
learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete,
particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many
independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important
regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation
models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing
assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal
bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;
for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable
guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective
sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing
single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective
sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in
multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general
approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first
controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a
reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in
parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields
instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set
of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a
simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian
noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and
linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the
instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over
standard reductions.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system
itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization
under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a
novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under
uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in
stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the
underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation
operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the
random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per
iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based
optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points,
resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in
computational engineering.

Conclusion: 性能预测方法可用于任何需要预测性而非反应性模型加权的场景，但需要根据具体问题调整特征和训练参数。

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are
combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated
performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing
strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to
dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations
that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.
Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving
averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing
circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that
uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at
each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning
higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We
show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning
network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the
accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that
predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret
z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than
models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network
inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series
of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model
can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.
These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each
domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using
performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any
situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing
pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and
without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in
developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have
gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of
widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We
argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are
fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model
spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived
performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic
heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities
of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete
recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide
future research in a more meaningful direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力下沉和压缩谷作为大语言模型中的两个谜题现象，此前被孤立研究。本文旨在揭示两者之间的内在联系，并建立统一的理论框架来解释LLM的信息处理机制。

Method: 通过理论证明大规模激活必然产生表征压缩，并在多个模型（410M-120B参数）上进行实验验证。当序列开始标记在中间层产生极端激活范数时，压缩谷和注意力下沉同时出现。进行针对性消融研究验证理论预测。

Result: 实验证实了大规模激活与表征压缩之间的因果关系，当BOS标记在中间层产生极端激活时，压缩谷和注意力下沉现象同时出现。消融研究验证了理论预测的正确性。

Conclusion: 提出了Mix-Compress-Refine信息流理论，认为基于Transformer的LLM在三个不同阶段处理标记：早期层广泛混合、中间层压缩计算、后期层选择性精炼。该框架解释了为什么嵌入任务在中间层表现最佳，而生成任务受益于全深度处理。

Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention
as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in
isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention
sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive
activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive
activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish
bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several
models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence
token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression
valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies
validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose
the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain
how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and
representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit
that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad
mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in
the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our
framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate
layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying
differences in task-dependent representations.

Conclusion: EDFL作为第一阶段过滤器可减少83%的验证负担，但不能作为安全关键领域的独立解决方案，因为10.9%的停止序列仍不正确。

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying
anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our
approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full
models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized
empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control
regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean
estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support
adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL
reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining
delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated
skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across
skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence
boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving
anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control
information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences
remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a
first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone
solution for safety-critical domains.

Result: 使用GUIDE后，师生质量差距减少了25-26%，在大型学生模型上效果显著，且与知识蒸馏结合时效果接近叠加。

Conclusion: GUIDE方法在几乎零成本的情况下显著提升模型质量，比单独使用知识蒸馏效果更好。

Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency techniques such as distillation
(\cite{hinton2015distillation}) are useful in improving model quality without
increasing serving costs, provided a larger teacher model is available for a
smaller student model to learn from during training. Standard distillation
methods are limited to only forcing the student to match the teacher's outputs.
Given the costs associated with training a large model, we believe we should be
extracting more useful information from a teacher model than by just making the
student match the teacher's outputs.
  In this paper, we introduce \guide (Guided Initialization and Distillation of
Embeddings). \guide can be considered a distillation technique that forces the
student to match the teacher in the parameter space. Using \guide we show
25-26\% reduction in the teacher-student quality gap when using large student
models (400M - 1B parameters) trained on $\approx$ 20B tokens. We also present
a thorough analysis demonstrating that \guide can be combined with knowledge
distillation with near additive improvements. Furthermore, we show that
applying \guide alone leads to substantially better model quality than applying
knowledge distillation by itself.
  Most importantly, \guide introduces no training or inference overhead and
hence any model quality gains from our method are virtually free.

Abstract: Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced
by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper
introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that
automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based
on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to
time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to
enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality
datasets, including both GAMS-dataset and proprietary data collected from a

optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improves the accuracy of
machine learning models compared to fixed time lengths. ATLO-ML shows potential
for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a
robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning
workflows.

Conclusion: Medix框架通过中位数操作有效识别异常值，结合理论保证和实证验证，为OOD检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world
applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data,
showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However,
effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the
mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a
distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD
classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to
identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We
use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency,
as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and
outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we
train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error
bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results
further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across
the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical
insights.

Abstract: Generative AI leaderboards are central to evaluating model capabilities, but
remain vulnerable to manipulation. Among key adversarial objectives is rank
manipulation, where an attacker must first deanonymize the models behind
displayed outputs -- a threat previously demonstrated and explored for large
language models (LLMs). We show that this problem can be even more severe for
text-to-image leaderboards, where deanonymization is markedly easier. Using
over 150,000 generated images from 280 prompts and 19 diverse models spanning
multiple organizations, architectures, and sizes, we demonstrate that simple
real-time classification in CLIP embedding space identifies the generating
model with high accuracy, even without prompt control or historical data. We
further introduce a prompt-level separability metric and identify prompts that
enable near-perfect deanonymization. Our results indicate that rank
manipulation in text-to-image leaderboards is easier than previously
recognized, underscoring the need for stronger defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络输出的独立性，以验证Alignment Research Center提出的计算无巧合猜想，该猜想旨在衡量AI可解释性的极限。

Method: 分析随机初始化神经网络的输出特性，特别关注激活函数在Gaussian测度下是否具有零均值性质。

Result: 当激活函数在Gaussian测度下具有零均值时，大宽度神经网络的输出几乎相互独立。这适用于ReLU+偏移、GeLU+偏移、tanh等函数，但不适用于原始ReLU或GeLU。

Conclusion: 具有零均值激活函数的神经网络因其输出独立性，是验证计算无巧合猜想的有力候选模型，对AI可解释性研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and
a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly
when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian
measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this
includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or
GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose
neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate
for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture --
a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.

*Ameya Anjarlekar,Rasoul Etesami,R Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出将POMDP近似为有限状态MDP（称为超状态MDP）的方法，通过理论保证和基于策略的学习方法，使用TD学习和策略优化来近似求解POMDP问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: POMDP中信念状态的连续性给学习最优策略带来了显著的计算挑战，需要找到有效的近似方法来处理非马尔可夫动态。

Method: 将POMDP模型近似为有限状态MDP（超状态MDP），使用线性函数近似的基于策略学习方法，结合TD学习和策略优化。

Result: 推导了改进的理论保证，表明近似误差随历史长度呈指数级下降，并首次量化了在非马尔可夫动态中应用标准TD学习引入的误差。

Conclusion: POMDP可以通过将其视为MDP并使用TD学习和策略优化来近似求解，其中MDP状态对应于有限历史，且近似性能随历史长度指数级提升。

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant
computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we
consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning
(PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first
derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the
optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value
function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning
approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the
Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be
approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by
treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We
show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of
this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the
first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD
learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

TL;DR: 本文从数学角度分析了强化学习中通过自回归模型简单目标条件化产生的策略不连贯性问题，证明了在线RL微调离线学习策略可以减少不连贯性并提高回报，建立了训练-推断权衡的三重对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强化学习策略中由于自回归模型简单目标条件化导致的结构性不连贯问题，以及通过在线RL微调离线策略的改进效果。

Method: 通过重新构建控制即推断和软Q学习标准概念，建立三重对应关系，分析迭代重训练过程，并讨论软条件生成模型与有效视野的联系。

Result: 证明在线RL微调可以减少策略不连贯性并提高回报，建立了训练-推断权衡的计算对应关系。

Conclusion: 通过软条件生成模型揭示了不连贯性与有效视野之间的联系，为改进强化学习策略提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue
with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of
autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their
own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We
prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and
we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing
standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a
three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative
re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the
deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence
has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through
soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence
and the effective horizon.

TL;DR: 提出了Markovian Thinking范式，通过将推理分解为固定大小的块来避免注意力机制的二次计算开销，实现线性计算和恒定内存使用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习推理环境中，状态随推理长度增长而无限扩大，导致注意力机制需要二次计算开销，限制了长链推理的可扩展性

Method: 提出Delethink环境，将推理结构化为固定大小的块，在每个块边界重置上下文并用简短摘要重新初始化提示，通过强化学习训练模型学习在块结束时写入足够的文本状态以实现无缝推理延续

Result: 1.5B模型在8K令牌块中推理但思考长度可达24K令牌，性能匹配或超越使用24K预算的LongCoT-RL；在96K平均思考长度下，Delethink成本仅为LongCoT-RL的1/4

Conclusion: 重新设计思考环境是实现高效可扩展推理LLMs的有力杠杆，能够实现超长推理而无需二次开销

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

Motivation: AI在临床试验中具有巨大潜力，但缺乏安全保障的部署存在显著风险，特别是在评估直接影响试验结论的患者终点时。

Method: 比较两种AI框架与纯人工评估，测量成本、准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力，通过注入从随机猜测到简单预测的劣质模型来压力测试框架。使用两个基于脊柱X射线图像的随机对照试验进行评估。

Result: AI作为辅助阅读器（AI-SR）方法在所有标准下表现最佳，即使使用劣质模型也能提供可靠的疾病估计，保持临床试验治疗效果估计和结论的有效性，并在不同人群中保持这些优势。

Conclusion: AI-SR是临床试验中最合适的AI应用方法，能够在各种模型类型下保持可靠性，确保治疗效果估计的有效性，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical
trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response
prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,
particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial
conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for
medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,
and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad
models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that
observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We
evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints
derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a
supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as
it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This
method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical
trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages
when applied to different populations.

*Canyu Lei,Benjamin Lobo,Jianxin Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPA-Net双路径注意力神经网络，从稀疏的SMBG数据直接估计AGP血糖指标，解决CGM设备昂贵且不易获取的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CGM设备成本高、可及性差，而SMBG虽然便宜易得但数据稀疏不规则，难以转化为有临床意义的血糖指标。

Method: DPA-Net包含两个互补路径：空间通道注意力路径重建CGM样轨迹，多尺度ResNet路径直接预测AGP指标，并引入对齐机制减少偏差。还开发了主动点选择器识别有意义的采样点。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验表明，DPA-Net实现了稳健的准确性和低误差，同时减少了系统偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首个从SMBG数据估计AGP指标的监督机器学习框架，为无法使用CGM的场景提供了实用的临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides dense and dynamic glucose
profiles that enable reliable estimation of Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)
metrics, such as Time in Range (TIR), Time Below Range (TBR), and Time Above
Range (TAR). However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict
its widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In
contrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely
available but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to
translate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.
  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to
estimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two
complementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a
CGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet
path that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two
paths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we
develop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG
sampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.
  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net
achieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first supervised machine learning framework
for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, offering a practical and clinically
relevant decision-support tool in settings where CGM is not accessible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POME是一种无需额外数据或优化的后处理算法，通过对微调权重与预训练权重之差进行截断SVD投影，提升微调后大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法往往在优化过程中引入噪声或导致某些更新方向过度主导，影响模型性能。需要一种简单、零成本的方法来优化微调后的模型权重。

Method: 计算微调权重与预训练权重的差值ΔW，使用截断奇异值分解(SVD)对ΔW进行投影，平衡主导更新方向的影响并修剪代表噪声的小奇异值。

Result: 在GSM8K上平均性能提升+2.5%，在代码生成任务上提升+1.0%，适用于从7B到72B的各种规模模型，包括RLHF指导的模型。

Conclusion: POME作为一种简单后处理步骤，与训练流程完全解耦，无需修改训练过程，为零成本提升任何微调流程性能提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Post-Optimization Model Edit (POME), a new algorithm that
enhances the performance of fine-tuned large language models using only their
pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, without requiring extra data or further
optimization. The core idea is to apply a muon-style projection to $\Delta W$,
the difference between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. This projection
uses truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to equalize the influence of
dominant update directions and prune small singular values, which often
represent noise. As a simple post-processing step, POME is completely decoupled
from the training pipeline. It requires zero modifications and imposes no
overhead, making it universally compatible with any optimizer or distributed
framework. POME delivers consistent gains, boosting average performance by
+2.5\% on GSM8K and +1.0\% on code generation. Its broad applicability -- from
7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models -- establishes it as a
practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline. Code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/POME.

Conclusion: 该方法能够从有限的传感器部署中实现准确的网络范围预测，可有效扩展到各种地下水管网系统。

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but
plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water
loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual
inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively
expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is
increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an
integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak
detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of
remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet -
a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter,
slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a
real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system
collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to
outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing
with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from
limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively
extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

Result: 实验结果表明，在生物医学信号上聚类准确率提升5.6%±2.7%，在面部图像上提升11.1%±7.2%。

Conclusion: Chem-NMF方法通过物理化学视角成功解决了多层NMF的收敛问题，显著提升了聚类性能，为NMF收敛分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning method
offering low-rank representations across various domains such as audio
processing, biomedical signal analysis, and image recognition. The
incorporation of $\alpha$-divergence in NMF formulations enhances flexibility
in optimization, yet extending these methods to multi-layer architectures
presents challenges in ensuring convergence. To address this, we introduce a
novel approach inspired by the Boltzmann probability of the energy barriers in
chemical reactions to theoretically perform convergence analysis. We introduce
a novel method, called Chem-NMF, with a bounding factor which stabilizes
convergence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a physical
chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze the convergence behaviour of the
NMF algorithm. We start from mathematically proven asymptotic convergence
results and then show how they apply to real data. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves clustering accuracy by 5.6%
$\pm$ 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% $\pm$ 7.2% on face images (mean
$\pm$ std).

Result: 在五个不同的成像任务中，该方法将生成质量平均提升了9个FID分数，并降低了输入与生成样本之间的传输成本。

Conclusion: 该方法使流匹配成为科学中各种分布变换的更实用工具，能更好地突出变换的真实效果。

Abstract: Modeling transformations between arbitrary data distributions is a
fundamental scientific challenge, arising in applications like drug discovery
and evolutionary simulation. While flow matching offers a natural framework for
this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting,
while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is
underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data
distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails
due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and
computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training
process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse
imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method
significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by
an average of 9 FID points. Our approach also reduces the transport cost
between input and generated samples to better highlight the true effect of the
transformation, making flow matching a more practical tool for simulating the
diverse distribution transformations that arise in science.

Motivation: 传统符号回归方法缺乏从时间序列观测中提取结构化物理先验的机制，难以捕捉反映系统全局行为的符号表达式

Method: 在训练好的PINN输出上执行局部泰勒展开获取导数结构信息；引入基于掩码的归因机制量化子树贡献；使用混合适应度函数联合最小化物理残差和泰勒系数失配

Result: 在基准PDE系统上的实验表明，StruSR相比传统基线提高了收敛速度、结构保真度和表达式可解释性

Conclusion: StruSR为基于物理的符号发现提供了一个有原则的范式

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains
underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained
ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习中的一个核心挑战是建模连续现象，这些现象在实践中以离散方式表示。MLOs被引入作为实现这一建模目标的工具，但需要评估其是否能够进行零样本超分辨率推理。

Method: 将多分辨率推理分解为两个关键行为：1)对不同频率信息的推断；2)在不同分辨率间的插值。通过实证评估MLOs的零样本能力，并提出了一个计算效率高、数据驱动的多分辨率训练协议。

Result: 实证研究表明MLOs无法以零样本方式完成频率推断和分辨率插值任务，在未经训练的分辨率上推理不准确，容易受到混叠影响。提出的训练协议能够克服混叠问题并提供稳健的多分辨率泛化。

Conclusion: MLOs本身无法实现零样本多分辨率推理，需要通过专门的多分辨率训练协议来获得稳健的跨分辨率泛化能力。

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

Motivation: 前向-前向算法主要局限于监督学习，而强化学习领域自然产生学习信号，需要将其扩展到RL领域。

Method: 引入动作条件均方根Q函数(ARQ)，结合前向-前向算法的优良函数和动作条件，使用时间差分学习进行局部强化学习。

Result: 在MinAtar和DeepMind Control Suite基准测试中，ARQ优于最先进的局部无反向传播RL方法，并在大多数任务中超过使用反向传播的算法。

Conclusion: ARQ方法虽然简单且具有生物学基础，但在强化学习任务中表现出色，证明了前向-前向算法思想在RL领域的有效性。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure
for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional
forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains
largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where
learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work,
inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we
introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value
estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for
local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and
biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind

Method: 放松概率约束，采用灵活的高斯投影参数化，基于高斯混合模型和高斯核距离特性构建可微分模块

Result: 在MLP、CNN、注意力机制、LSTM等架构中集成GMNM，相比标准基线模型性能均有提升

Conclusion: GMNM作为强大灵活模块，有潜力提升各种机器学习应用的效率和准确性

Abstract: Neural networks in general, from MLPs and CNNs to attention-based
Transformers, are constructed from layers of linear combinations followed by
nonlinear operations such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax. Despite their strength,
these conventional designs are often limited in introducing non-linearity by
the choice of activation functions. In this work, we introduce Gaussian
Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM), a new class of differentiable
modules that draw on the universal density approximation Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and distance properties (metric space) of Gaussian kernal. By
relaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of
Gaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural
architectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as
MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance
over standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful
and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range
of machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer架构中注意力头数量对表达能力的理论影响，建立了参数复杂度的上下界，证明多头注意力在函数逼近中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer已成为序列建模的主流架构，但其结构参数如何影响表达能力尚缺乏深入理解，特别是注意力头数量的作用机制需要理论分析。

Method: 引入广义D-检索任务作为理论基础，建立ε-逼近的参数复杂度上下界，分析单头和多头情况，并在合成数据和真实任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 证明多头Transformer可实现高效逼近，而头数过少时参数复杂度需按O(1/ε^{cT})增长；单头情况下需要O(T)维嵌入才能完全记忆输入。

Conclusion: 注意力头数量是Transformer表达能力的关键因素，为理解其逼近性质提供了首个非线性场景下的严格下界，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a
detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive
power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of
transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention
heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval
task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby
providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper
and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for
$\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with
sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few
heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$,
for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge,
this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and
practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and
demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete
memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the
feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with
experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the
practical relevance of our results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XRPO是一个基于探索-利用原则的强化学习框架，通过自适应rollout分配、上下文种子策略和优势锐化机制，提升LLM推理能力，在数学和编程基准上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO等强化学习方法存在探索不足的问题：跨提示的rollout分配缺乏上下文感知，主要依赖稀疏奖励，导致在困难提示上训练停滞且信息反馈信号未被充分利用。

Method: 1. 数学基础的rollout分配器，自适应优先处理不确定性降低潜力大的提示；2. 上下文种子策略，注入精选示例引导模型进入更困难的推理轨迹；3. 组相对、新颖性感知的优势锐化机制，利用序列似然放大低概率但正确的响应。

Result: 在多样化的数学和编程基准测试中，XRPO在推理和非推理模型上均优于现有方法（如GRPO和GSPO），pass@1提升达4%，cons@32提升达6%，同时训练收敛速度加快达2.7倍。

Conclusion: XRPO通过统一的探索-利用框架有效解决了LLM强化学习中的探索不足问题，证明了自适应rollout分配和优势锐化在提升模型推理性能方面的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO have driven recent advances in
large language model (LLM) reasoning. While scaling the number of rollouts
stabilizes training, existing approaches suffer from limited exploration on
challenging prompts and leave informative feedback signals underexploited, due
to context-independent rollout allocation across prompts (e.g., generating 16
rollouts per prompt) and relying heavily on sparse rewards. This paper presents
XRPO(eXplore - eXploit GRPO), a unified framework that recasts policy
optimization through the principled lens of rollout exploration-exploitation.
To enhance exploration, XRPO introduces a mathematically grounded rollout
allocator that adaptively prioritizes prompts with higher potential for
uncertainty reduction. It further addresses stagnation on zero-reward prompts
through an in-context seeding strategy that injects curated exemplars, steering
the model into more difficult reasoning trajectories. To strengthen
exploitation, XRPO develops a group-relative, novelty-aware advantage
sharpening mechanism that leverages sequence likelihoods to amplify
low-probability yet correct responses, thereby extending the policy's reach
beyond sparse rewards. Experiments across diverse math and coding benchmarks on
both reasoning and non-reasoning models demonstrate that XRPO outperforms
existing advances (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, while
accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TimeFormer，一种专为时间序列设计的Transformer架构，通过改进的自注意力机制MoSA来捕捉时间序列的单向性和衰减特性，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳，主要因为未充分考虑文本与时间序列模态的差异，特别是时间序列的单向影响和随时间衰减的特性。

Method: 提出TimeFormer架构，核心是MoSA自注意力机制，结合Hawkes过程和因果掩码来建模时间序列先验；采用多尺度和子序列分析框架捕捉不同时间尺度的语义依赖。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，TimeFormer显著优于现有方法，MSE最多降低7.45%，在94.04%的评估指标上创下新纪录；MoSA机制可泛化提升其他Transformer模型性能。

Conclusion: TimeFormer通过专门设计的时间序列注意力机制有效解决了Transformer在时序预测中的局限性，为时序建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Transformers excel in natural language processing, their extension
to time series forecasting remains challenging due to insufficient
consideration of the differences between textual and temporal modalities. In
this paper, we develop a novel Transformer architecture designed for time
series data, aiming to maximize its representational capacity. We identify two
key but often overlooked characteristics of time series: (1) unidirectional
influence from the past to the future, and (2) the phenomenon of decaying
influence over time. These characteristics are introduced to enhance the
attention mechanism of Transformers. We propose TimeFormer, whose core
innovation is a self-attention mechanism with two modulation terms (MoSA),
designed to capture these temporal priors of time series under the constraints
of the Hawkes process and causal masking. Additionally, TimeFormer introduces a
framework based on multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture semantic
dependencies at different temporal scales, enriching the temporal dependencies.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that
TimeFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to
a 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to the best baseline and setting new
benchmarks on 94.04\% of evaluation metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
MoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance the performance of other
Transformer-based models.

Motivation: 解决分布式多玩家多臂老虎机问题中玩家间的碰撞问题，在无中心协调的情况下，仅通过自身动作和碰撞反馈实现高效协作。

Method: 设计分布式算法，采用自适应高效通信协议，玩家仅观察自身动作和碰撞反馈，无需中央协调。

Result: 算法实现近最优的群体和个人遗憾，通信成本仅为O(log log T)，实验显示相比现有方法显著降低个人遗憾。

Conclusion: 所提方法在分布式多玩家多臂老虎机问题中表现优异，通信效率高，并可扩展到周期性异步设置中实现对数遗憾。

Abstract: We study the stochastic Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problem, where
multiple players select arms to maximize their cumulative rewards. Collisions
occur when two or more players select the same arm, resulting in no reward, and
are observed by the players involved. We consider a distributed setting without
central coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and
collision feedback. We propose a distributed algorithm with an adaptive,
efficient communication protocol. The algorithm achieves near-optimal group and
individual regret, with a communication cost of only $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$.
Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing
baselines. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves a
notable reduction in individual regret. Finally, we extend our approach to a
periodic asynchronous setting, proving the lower bound for this problem and
presenting an algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了现有深度神经网络模型提取攻击在深度增加时假设不现实的问题，提出了跨层提取方法，通过利用神经元跨层交互显著降低查询复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于硬标签的模型提取攻击（如Carlini等人的工作）在攻击深度增加时假设变得不现实，实际需要指数级查询量，无法保持多项式时间复杂性。

Method: 提出CrossLayer Extraction方法，不直接提取特定神经元的秘密参数，而是利用神经元在跨层间的交互作用，从更深层提取信息。

Result: 新方法显著降低了查询复杂度，缓解了现有模型提取方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 跨层提取技术为深度神经网络模型提取提供了更实用的解决方案，克服了现有方法在深度增加时的指数级查询成本问题。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention, and their
internal models are now considered valuable intellectual assets. Extracting
these internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to
extracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,
cryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been
actively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely
deployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)
assume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent
works (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,
where only the final classification result (e.g., "dog" or "car") is available
to the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that
model extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted
setting.
  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack
become increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,
satisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with
respect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in
polynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack
method called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret
parameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs
exponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this
information from deeper layers. This technique significantly reduces query
complexity and mitigates the limitations of existing model extraction
approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两步框架，用于生成不规则时间序列数据：首先使用时间序列变换器补全序列，然后使用带掩码的视觉扩散模型进行生成，显著提升了生成质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列数据通常存在不规则采样和缺失值问题，现有方法处理这些不规则性时效果不佳且计算成本高。ImagenTime模型虽然展示了强大的生成能力，但直接应用于不规则序列时会产生不自然的邻域关系。

Method: 1. 使用时间序列变换器补全不规则序列，创建自然邻域；2. 使用带掩码的视觉扩散模型，最小化对补全值的依赖。结合补全和掩码的优势，实现鲁棒高效的时间序列生成。

Result: 在判别分数上实现了70%的相对提升，计算成本降低了85%，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合补全和掩码策略，有效解决了不规则时间序列生成中的邻域问题，为医疗、金融和科学领域的应用提供了高质量的合成数据生成方案。

Abstract: Generating realistic time series data is critical for applications in
healthcare, finance, and science. However, irregular sampling and missing
values present significant challenges. While prior methods address these
irregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high
computational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as
the diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable
generative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations,
making them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular
sequences using simple masking introduces "unnatural" neighborhoods, where
missing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome
this, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer
completes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a
vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed
values. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking,
enabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in
discriminative score by $70\%$ and in computational cost by $85\%$. Code is at

<details>

Motivation: 解决目标条件强化学习中状态表示对原始表示敏感、包含外生噪声的问题，寻求一种仅依赖环境内在动态的鲁棒表示方法。

Method: 开发了双重目标表示学习框架，通过状态间时间距离关系来编码状态，该方法可与现有GCRL算法结合使用。

Result: 在OGBench任务套件的20个状态和像素任务上实验表明，双重目标表示能持续提升离线目标达成性能。

Conclusion: 双重目标表示为GCRL提供了一种理论上有保证且实用的表示学习方法，能有效提高学习效率和性能。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state
by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it
encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by
temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical
properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment
and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains
provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy,
while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we
develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined
with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench
task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently
improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based
tasks.

Motivation: 在异构领域中，现有的先验知识获取方法假设单一因果图，不适用于异构设置，需要开发能够处理因果图混合的方法。

Method: 基于贝叶斯实验设计原则的因果获取策略，以及扩展DiBS方法的变分混合结构学习方法，通过迭代推断因果贝叶斯网络混合物。

Result: 在异构合成数据上，当有模拟专家信息时，该方法成功生成替代因果模型集合，并提高了结构学习性能。在乳腺癌数据库中能够捕捉复杂分布。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理异构领域的因果发现问题，结合专家反馈生成因果模型混合物，在合成和真实数据上都表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery benefits from prior information elicited from
domain experts, and in heterogeneous domains any prior knowledge would be badly
needed. However, so far prior elicitation approaches have assumed a single
causal graph and hence are not suited to heterogeneous domains. We propose a
causal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous settings, based on Bayesian
experimental design (BED) principles, and a variational mixture structure
learning (VaMSL) method -- extending the earlier differentiable Bayesian
structure learning (DiBS) method -- to iteratively infer mixtures of causal
Bayesian networks (CBNs). We construct an informative graph prior incorporating
elicited expert feedback in the inference of mixtures of CBNs. Our proposed
method successfully produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture
components or clusters), and achieves an improved structure learning
performance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by a simulated
expert. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of capturing
complex distributions in a breast cancer database.

Motivation: 函数回归是机器学习的基本应用，Forward-Forward算法是一种无需反向传播的新型训练方法，但目前仅限于分类任务，需要扩展其应用范围。

Method: 开发了基于Forward-Forward算法的函数回归方法，并扩展到Kolmogorov Arnold网络和深度物理神经网络。

Result: 成功实现了函数回归任务，在单变量和多变量函数上进行了验证。

Conclusion: Forward-Forward算法可以有效地应用于函数回归任务，为神经网络的训练提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine
learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression
using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning
algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without
backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic
computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is
currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new
methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the
Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed
methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary
studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Conclusion: 证明了PINNs在局域化、长期流行病学建模中的实用性，能够有效跟踪疫情进展并揭示区域传播动态。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and
analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc
analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the
effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies
and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly
incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the
SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main
contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics
across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate
state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying
reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results
highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing
correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with
major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in
localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了推理计算稳健性假设(RICH)，认为当模型训练数据更好地反映被攻击数据的组成成分时，推理计算防御能带来稳健性收益。通过组合泛化，即使面对对抗性OOD数据，模型也能遵循防御规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明LLM推理能提高对防御规范的遵循度，从而增强对越狱攻击的稳健性，但这种测试时计算的好处在使用梯度或多模态输入的强大攻击者面前会减弱。论文旨在填补这一空白，证明推理计算在这些情况下仍能提供稳健性收益。

Method: 提出稳健性来自推理计算假设(RICH)，通过组合泛化使模型能够理解OOD数据的ID组成成分，从而在对抗性OOD输入上遵循防御规范。在视觉语言模型和多种攻击类型上进行实证验证。

Result: 研究发现，如果通过组合泛化解锁了对OOD数据的规范遵循，测试时计算能带来稳健性收益，而RL微调和长时间推理不是关键因素。例如，通过提示增强防御规范能降低对经过对抗预训练的VLM的梯度多模态攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 推理计算的稳健性收益与基础模型稳健性相关，形成富者愈富的动态。建议将训练时和测试时防御层叠使用以获得协同效益。

Abstract: Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data
despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba
et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning
improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks,
resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to
jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are
given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying
that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues
that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via
its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive
specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness
from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as
the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We
empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack
types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification
following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL
finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing
emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of
gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial
pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to
not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness
benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:
attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding
compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering
train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

Conclusion: 在OCGL中，通过架构简单性和稳定性可以最小化灾难性遗忘，无需复杂的重放或正则化机制。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the main obstacles for Online Continual
Graph Learning (OCGL), where nodes arrive one by one, distribution drifts may
occur at any time and offline training on task-specific subgraphs is not
feasible. In this work, we explore a surprisingly simple yet highly effective
approach for OCGL: we use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to generate
robust and expressive node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information,
training online only a lightweight classifier. By freezing the encoder, we
eliminate drifts of the representation parameters, a key source of forgetting,
obtaining embeddings that are both expressive and stable. When evaluated across
several OCGL benchmarks, despite its simplicity and lack of memory buffer, this
approach yields consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, with surprising
improvements of up to 30% and performance often approaching that of the joint
offline-training upper bound. These results suggest that in OCGL, catastrophic
forgetting can be minimized without complex replay or regularization by
embracing architectural simplicity and stability.

Motivation: 前沿LLM需要大量推理token来解决基本计算问题，且现有tokenization策略将单个数字分割成多个token，限制了LLM处理复杂数值问题的能力。

Method: 提出BitTokens tokenization策略，使用IEEE 754二进制浮点表示将任何数字嵌入到单个token中，并建立了一套编码需求标准。

Result: 实验表明BitTokens使小型语言模型能够近乎完美地学习解决基本算术运算的算法，显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: BitTokens的新效率可以扩展语言模型能够解决的问题的长度和复杂性，为科学和工程应用提供更好的数值处理能力。

Abstract: To drive progress in science and engineering, large language models (LLMs)
must be able to process large amounts of numerical data and solve long
calculations efficiently. This is currently only possible through the use of
external tools or extensive reasoning chains, either limiting the numerical
intuition of LLMs or limiting the length of problems they can solve. We show
that frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even
basic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that
split single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for
efficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of
desiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill
them. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization
strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary
floating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our
BitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic
arithmetic operations nearly perfectly. This newly gained efficiency could
expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve.

Result: 训练损失随序列长度遵循幂律关系，长序列训练虽然时间成本线性增加，但总能获得更低的损失，在时间效率上具有优势。

Conclusion: 循环机制在长序列智能体任务中不可或缺，提出的循环完备架构在长时间任务中表现优于纯注意力模型。

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in
the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously
unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are
not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this
paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable
forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically
interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical
time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs
correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software
engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete
architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a
power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains
fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly
increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Abstract: Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and
forms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally,
research cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a
diagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study
aims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms
from triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our
proposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on
twosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term
memory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the
classification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm.
Thisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few
specific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years
are used as a case study; the results demonstrated 82%, 52%,and 41% accurate
forecasts for 10, 20, and 30 min alarm forecasts, respectively. The results
substantiateanticipating and averting alarms, which is significant in curbing
alarm frequency and enhancing operationalefficiency through proactive
intervention.

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial
intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel
using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based
on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the
first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and
simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by
softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for
exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the
exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new
custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the
goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability
of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the
vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical
applications.

Motivation: CNN擅长捕捉局部模式和平移不变性，而变换器通过自注意力有效建模长程依赖关系，结合两者优势以提升多变量时间序列预测性能。

Method: 使用一维卷积层层次结构从原始输入序列中提取显著局部模式，降噪降维后输入TFT，通过多头注意力捕获短长期依赖并自适应加权相关协变量。

Conclusion: CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW架构对于需要高保真度多变量时间序列预测的应用具有前景，通过SHAP-MHAW方法获得模型可解释性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer
strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns
and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range
dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture
integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer
(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module
first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill
salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and
dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which
applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies
and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a
hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,
with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the
model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head
attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,
is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series
forecasts, being available for future analysis at

TL;DR: 该研究使用机器学习方法（逻辑回归、随机森林、支持向量机）预测银行破产概率，相比传统统计方法具有更高准确性，有助于维护金融系统稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银行破产会破坏金融系统稳定，传统统计方法（如Altman Z-Score）依赖僵化假设，预测准确性低，需要更有效的新方法。

Method: 使用机器学习技术（LR、RF、SVM）开发破产预测模型，数据来自土耳其44家活跃银行和21家破产银行的年度财务报表（1994-2004），以及印尼43家活跃和43家破产农村银行的季度财务报告（2013-2019）。

Result: 随机森林对商业银行数据的预测准确率达到90%，三种机器学习方法都能准确预测农村银行破产可能性。

Conclusion: 提出的创新机器学习方法有助于实施降低破产成本的政策，为银行风险管理提供更有效的工具。

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the
banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial
system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual
banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the
probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is
safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such
as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a
bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and
sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.
New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are
developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),
random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several
studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical
methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present
Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial
statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to
2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports
of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.
Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the
feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The
results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from
commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine
learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank
bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine
learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of
bankruptcy.

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale
power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.
Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with
scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable
scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose
a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models
buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as
distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for
handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN
achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot
to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap
despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also
improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to
10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,
generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

TL;DR: 提出了SaFeR-VLM框架，通过安全对齐的强化学习将安全性直接嵌入多模态推理过程，解决了MLRMs在对抗性或不安全提示下放大安全风险的"推理税"问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大推理模型在跨模态推理方面表现出色，但在对抗性或不安全提示下会放大安全风险，现有防御主要在输出层面，未能约束推理过程，导致模型面临隐含风险。

Method: 提出SaFeR-VLM框架，包含四个组件：QI-Safe-10K数据集、安全感知的rollout机制、结构化奖励建模和GRPO优化，将安全性从被动保护转变为主动推理驱动。

Result: SaFeR-VLM-3B在六个基准测试中安全性和帮助性平均得分分别为70.13和78.97，超越同规模及10倍以上更大模型；SaFeR-VLM-7B在安全指标上超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash，且不降低帮助性性能。

Conclusion: SaFeR-VLM将安全性直接嵌入推理过程，实现了可扩展和可泛化的安全感知推理，对显性和隐性风险都具有鲁棒性，支持超越表面过滤的动态可解释安全决策。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.
SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and
helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$
larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.
Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass
GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points
respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any
degradation in helpfulness performance. Our codes are available at

mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data.
Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN
captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing

Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream
cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity,

Conclusion: SpherePair方法通过角度约束嵌入成功解决了深度约束聚类中的关键问题，提供了理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare,
and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing
multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for
such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in
this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their
deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge
computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural
Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a
new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather
than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike
Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural
activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also
proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,
assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a
single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to
conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available
datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance
while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep
learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is
validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies
power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its
potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.

We examine two classification tasks: (i) a binary classification problem
focused on predicting driver alertness states, and (ii) a multilabel
classification problem based on the yeast dataset. Three state-of-the-art LLMs
(i.e. OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek) are prompted to design
training pipelines for four common classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost,
Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The generated
models are evaluated in terms of predictive performance (recall, precision, and
F1-score) and explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
Specifically, we measure Average SHAP Fidelity (Mean Squared Error between SHAP
approximations and model outputs) and Average SHAP Sparsity (number of features
deemed influential). The results reveal that LLMs are capable of producing
effective and interpretable models, achieving high fidelity and consistent
sparsity, highlighting their potential as automated tools for interpretable ML
pipeline generation. The results show that LLMs can produce effective,
interpretable pipelines with high fidelity and consistent sparsity, closely
matching manually engineered baselines.

Conclusion: 通过分解真实感和过滤误导性交互，DecompGAIL有效解决了多智能体模仿学习的不稳定性问题，为自动驾驶系统开发提供了更可靠的交通仿真方法。

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim
Agents 2025 benchmark.

Abstract: Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal
graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender
systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting
state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity
prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving
Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in
training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction
and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS -
Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the
equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising,
training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss
function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that
it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular
quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation
metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for
predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the
equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the
interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model
towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and
performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased,
towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results
in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that
are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is
likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an
analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features
controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models
with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We
furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier
models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN
models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay
between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are
relevant for the broader machine learning community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分组差分注意力(GDA)，通过非均衡的头分配策略改进自注意力机制，将更多头分配给信号提取组，较少头分配给噪声控制组，从而提高信号保真度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制存在效率问题，经常将大量注意力分配给冗余或噪声上下文。现有的差分注意力方法由于需要均衡的头分配，限制了表示灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 引入非均衡头分配策略，将注意力头分为信号保留组和噪声控制组，为信号提取分配更多头，为噪声控制分配较少头，并通过受控重复稳定噪声控制组。

Result: 大规模预训练和持续训练实验表明，适度的不平衡比率在泛化性和稳定性方面相比对称基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: 比率感知的头分配和选择性扩展为设计可扩展、计算高效的Transformer架构提供了有效实用的路径。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer
architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates
substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention
addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but
its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on
representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel
approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving
and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by
strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to
noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to
GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational
overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a
scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,
thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we
demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial
improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.
Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and
selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing
scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

*Zheng-An Chen,Tao Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文使用梯度流分析框架研究线性化Transformer的训练动态，发现注意力模块的训练分为两个阶段：第一阶段权重扰动帮助逃离小初始化状态，第二阶段键查询矩阵参与训练导致秩崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于Transformer的模型表现出优异的实证性能，但其训练动态的基本原理在特定配置研究之外缺乏充分表征。受语言模型在小初始化尺度下推理能力提升的实证证据启发，需要系统研究Transformer训练动态。

Method: 采用[Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022]建立的梯度流分析框架，系统研究线性化Transformer的训练动态，理论分析将注意力模块动态分解为两个不同阶段。

Result: 第一阶段：随机初始化的非对称权重扰动维持参数矩阵中的非退化梯度动态，促进系统性地逃离小初始化状态；第二阶段：先前静态的键查询矩阵积极参与训练，驱动归一化矩阵趋于渐近秩崩溃。

Conclusion: 这个两阶段框架推广了经典的方向收敛结果，为理解Transformer训练动态提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown exceptional empirical
performance, the fundamental principles governing their training dynamics are
inadequately characterized beyond configuration-specific studies. Inspired by
empirical evidence showing improved reasoning capabilities under small
initialization scales in language models, we employ the gradient flow
analytical framework established in [Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022] to
systematically investigate linearized Transformer training dynamics. Our
theoretical analysis dissects the dynamics of attention modules into two
distinct stages. In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from
random initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter
matrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes.
Subsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning
toward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static
key-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized
matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse. This two-stage framework generalizes
classical directional convergence results.

*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixout是一种替代Dropout的随机正则化技术，通过在训练过程中概率性地将微调权重与预训练权重交换来缓解过拟合，在领域泛化任务中需要高掩码率（ViT为0.9，ResNet为0.8），在保持与集成方法相当性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成多个基于预训练模型的微调模型是提高分布偏移下鲁棒性的常用策略，但计算和存储成本高昂。Dropout虽然轻量，但在预训练模型上容易过度正则化并破坏关键表示。

Method: 提出High-rate Mixout方法，使用高掩码率（ViT 0.9，ResNet 0.8）概率性地将微调权重替换为预训练权重，平衡适应性和先验知识保留。

Result: 在五个领域泛化基准测试中，High-rate Mixout达到了与集成方法相当的域外准确率，同时将梯度计算减少45%，梯度内存使用减少90%。

Conclusion: 高掩码率的Mixout在领域泛化任务中既能有效惩罚偏离预训练参数的行为，又能显著降低计算开销，是集成方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

TL;DR: GMixout是一种改进的随机正则化方法，通过动态权重锚点和显式重采样频率控制，在微调视觉基础模型时同时提升域内精度和分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法在提高域内精度的同时会损害模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性，需要一种能平衡两者性能的方法。

Method: 提出GMixout方法：1）用指数移动平均快照替代固定锚点；2）通过显式重采样频率超参数调节掩码周期；3）稀疏核实现仅更新小部分参数，无推理开销。

Result: 在ImageNet、DomainNet、iWildCam和CIFAR100-C等基准测试中，GMixout在域内精度超越零样本性能，在分布偏移下优于Model Soups和参数高效微调基线。

Conclusion: GMixout通过动态权重锚点和可控掩码机制，有效平衡了微调模型的域内精度和分布偏移鲁棒性，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

Conclusion: 提出的考虑量化模型锐度的零样本量化方法能够有效提升量化模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

<details>

Motivation: 联邦学习中的机器遗忘存在公平性问题（所有客户端被迫重新训练）和评估不现实（依赖合成数据假设），需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 提出FedCCCU方法，通过联邦跨客户端约束遗忘机制，在保持公平性的同时实现高效遗忘，适用于现实世界的数据异质性场景。

Result: 实验结果显示现有方法在真实设置下表现不佳，而FedCCCU方法在所有测试场景中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedCCCU为现实世界的联邦遗忘提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，解决了公平性和数据异质性的核心挑战。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the
"right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)
also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major
challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked.
Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining,
even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or
distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance
for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on
synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity.
These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit
the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive
benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and
fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach,
Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address
both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for
real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly
in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

Conclusion: FlexMol框架能够学习统一的分子表示，支持单模态输入，在分子表示学习领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/tewiSong/FlexMol.

Motivation: 现实世界中的LLM智能体需要通过多轮交互掌握策略性工具使用和用户偏好优化，以协助用户完成复杂规划任务。

Method: 构建了涵盖20个美国国家公园的交通、住宿和票务的真实旅行数据库，以及模拟商业预订平台的综合工具生态系统，将旅行规划建模为约束偏好优化问题。

Result: 评估发现两个关键差距：(i)可接受-最优差距：智能体可靠满足约束但未能优化偏好；(ii)规划协调差距：在多服务协调任务上性能崩溃，特别是开源模型。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过在实际用户导向领域中扎根推理和规划，提供了一个直接衡量智能体在真实任务中优化用户偏好能力的基准，连接理论进展与现实影响。

Abstract: Real-world large language model (LLM) agents must master strategic tool use
and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions to assist
users with complex planning tasks. We introduce COMPASS (Constrained
Optimization through Multi-turn Planning and Strategic Solutions), a benchmark
that evaluates agents on realistic travel-planning scenarios. We cast travel
planning as a constrained preference optimization problem, where agents must
satisfy hard constraints while simultaneously optimizing soft user preferences.
To support this, we build a realistic travel database covering transportation,
accommodation, and ticketing for 20 U.S. National Parks, along with a
comprehensive tool ecosystem that mirrors commercial booking platforms.
Evaluating state-of-the-art models, we uncover two critical gaps: (i) an
acceptable-optimal gap, where agents reliably meet constraints but fail to
optimize preferences, and (ii) a plan-coordination gap, where performance
collapses on multi-service (flight and hotel) coordination tasks, especially
for open-source models. By grounding reasoning and planning in a practical,
user-facing domain, COMPASS provides a benchmark that directly measures an
agent's ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging
theoretical advances with real-world impact.

Conclusion: 预训练编码器与高效超参数优化的结合可在普通CPU上实现竞争性的语音情感识别性能，并具有良好的跨语言泛化能力

Abstract: We propose a workflow for speech emotion recognition (SER) that combines
pre-trained representations with automated hyperparameter optimisation (HPO).
Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we
compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and
Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional
search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the
German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with
32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt
implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires
143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020
baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual
generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by
0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS. Results show that efficient HPO with
pre-trained encoders delivers competitive SER on commodity CPUs. Source code to

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督方法能够有效构建角功率图，在真实大规模MIMO网络中实现18米精度的定位，主要依赖单个服务小区的测量数据。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem in
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Radio maps provide a
promising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI
acquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction
require location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper
investigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large
timescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.
A hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a
mobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the
mobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power
map. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed
base stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error
can vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined
to a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent
measurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in
a real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18
meters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single
serving cell.

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: HTME能够提取更丰富有意义的序列表示，使Transformer预测器能更好地理解序列，实现轻量化高性能的时间序列预测。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series
forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in
sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This
incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding
performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly
dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To
address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective
information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional
embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.
These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand
the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate
Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature
extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction
module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between
model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer
architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction
capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments
conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文针对非平稳环境下的在线结构化预测问题，提出了一种新的遗憾界分析框架，将累积目标损失表示为比较器序列的累积代理损失和路径长度的函数，突破了传统有限遗憾界在非平稳环境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在线结构化预测中的代理遗憾界在平稳环境下具有与时间范围无关的有限界，但在非平稳环境中失效，因为固定估计器可能产生与时间线性增长的代理损失。需要开发适用于非平稳环境的遗憾界分析框架。

Method: 将在线梯度下降(OGD)的动态遗憾界与利用代理间隙的技术相结合，提出新的分析框架。同时引入Polyak风格的学习率，并通过卷积Fenchel-Young损失扩展到更广泛的问题类别。

Result: 证明了形式为$F_T + C(1 + P_T)$的累积目标损失界，其中$F_T$是比较器序列的累积代理损失，$P_T$是其路径长度，$C>0$为常数。该界仅通过$F_T$和$P_T$依赖于时间$T$。

Conclusion: 提出的分析框架在非平稳环境中提供了更强的保证，通过下界证明了对$F_T$和$P_T$的依赖是最优的。新方法不仅提供理论保证，还展现出有前景的实证性能。

Abstract: Online structured prediction, including online classification as a special
case, is the task of sequentially predicting labels from input features.
Therein the surrogate regret -- the cumulative excess of the target loss (e.g.,
0-1 loss) over the surrogate loss (e.g., logistic loss) of the fixed best
estimator -- has gained attention, particularly because it often admits a
finite bound independent of the time horizon $T$. However, such guarantees
break down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may
incur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving
a bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where
$F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its
path length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only
through $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in
non-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret
bound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the
surrogate gap. Our analysis also sheds light on a new Polyak-style learning
rate for OGD, which systematically offers target-loss guarantees and exhibits
promising empirical performance. We further extend our approach to a broader
class of problems via the convolutional Fenchel--Young loss. Finally, we prove
a lower bound showing that the dependence on $F_T$ and $P_T$ is tight.

Abstract: World models are a powerful paradigm in AI and robotics, enabling agents to
reason about the future by predicting visual observations or compact latent
states. The 1X World Model Challenge introduces an open-source benchmark of
real-world humanoid interaction, with two complementary tracks: sampling,
focused on forecasting future image frames, and compression, focused on
predicting future discrete latent codes. For the sampling track, we adapt the
video generation foundation model Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B to video-state-conditioned
future frame prediction. We condition the video generation on robot states
using AdaLN-Zero, and further post-train the model using LoRA. For the
compression track, we train a Spatio-Temporal Transformer model from scratch.
Our models achieve 23.0 dB PSNR in the sampling task and a Top-500 CE of 6.6386
in the compression task, securing 1st place in both challenges.

### [179] [Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Efficiency in Conformalized Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07093)
*Yunzhen Yao,Lie He,Michael Gastpar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了保形预测在回归任务中的效率问题，建立了非渐近边界来分析预测集长度与理想区间长度的偏差，揭示了不同α值下的收敛率相变现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于保形预测效率的研究通常将误覆盖率α视为固定常数，缺乏对α、训练集大小n和校准集大小m联合依赖关系的深入理解。

Method: 使用SGD训练的保形化分位数和中位数回归方法，在温和的数据分布假设下，建立了预测集长度偏差的非渐近边界。

Result: 获得了阶数为O(1/√n + 1/(α²n) + 1/√m + exp(-α²m))的边界，识别了不同α值下的收敛率相变现象。

Conclusion: 研究结果为数据分配以控制预测集超额长度提供了指导，实证结果与理论发现一致。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The
informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically
quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the
efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level
$\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds
on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length
for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild
assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$
capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,
the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results
identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of
$\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction
set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.

*Mariona Jaramillo-Civill,Peng Wu,Pau Closas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPMM-CFL是一种聚类联邦学习算法，使用狄利克雷过程先验来自动推断聚类数量和客户端分配，无需预先指定聚类数K。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的聚类联邦学习方法需要预先固定聚类数量K，但在实际应用中潜在聚类结构通常是未知的，这限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 在聚类参数分布上放置狄利克雷过程先验，通过非参数贝叶斯推断联合推断聚类数量和客户端分配，同时优化每聚类的联邦目标。

Result: 在Dirichlet和类分割非IID分区下的基准数据集上进行了验证。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在每轮中耦合联邦更新和聚类推断，自动确定最优聚类结构。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client
heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby
balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most
CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is
impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL
algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of
cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly
infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing
per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each
round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in
this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet
and class-split non-IID partitions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于状态保持的多智能体进化搜索框架，用于自动化单元测试生成，相比无状态方法在测试覆盖率上有显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无状态推理方法在多步任务上表现不佳，缺乏持久状态；特定任务微调只能实现表面代码生成，在需要深度推理和长程依赖的任务上表现脆弱

Method: 结合持久推理状态、对抗性变异和进化保留，通过专门智能体依次提出、变异和评分候选测试用例，控制器在代际间维护持久状态

Result: 在HumanEval和TestGenEvalMini等基准测试上，使用Llama、Gemma和GPT三种LLM，相比无状态单步基线方法在覆盖率上有显著提升

Conclusion: 将持久推理状态与进化搜索相结合能显著改进单元测试生成效果

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELMUR是一种具有结构化外部记忆的Transformer架构，通过LRU记忆模块扩展有效视野，在部分可观测环境中显著提升决策性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实机器人需要在部分可观测和长视野环境下行动，但现有方法主要依赖瞬时信息，难以有效利用长期依赖关系

Method: 提出ELMUR架构，每层维护记忆嵌入，通过双向交叉注意力与记忆交互，使用LRU记忆模块进行替换或凸混合更新

Result: 在合成T-Maze任务中达到100%成功率（走廊长达100万步），在POPGym中超过半数任务优于基线，在MIKASA-Robo稀疏奖励操作任务中性能几乎翻倍

Conclusion: 结构化的层本地外部记忆为部分可观测环境下的决策提供了一种简单且可扩展的方法

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long
horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.
However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,
without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer
models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context
windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and
sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a
transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains
memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and
updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using
replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000
times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a
synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it
outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo
sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles
the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,
layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision
making under partial observability.

*Patrick Peixuan Ye,Chen Shani,Ellen Vitercik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Bridged Clustering框架，通过独立聚类输入X和输出Y，然后用少量配对样本学习稀疏可解释的桥梁，实现半监督预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半监督学习未充分利用输出端数据，而密集传输方法缺乏可解释性。需要一种既能利用输出数据又保持稀疏可解释的方法。

Method: 首先独立聚类X和Y，然后用少量配对样本学习输入簇与输出簇之间的稀疏桥梁。推理时，新输入分配到最近输入簇，返回对应输出簇中心作为预测。

Result: 理论分析表明在聚类和桥梁错误率有界时，该算法是有效高效的预测器。实证结果与SOTA方法竞争，同时保持简单、模型无关和高标签效率。

Conclusion: Bridged Clustering在低监督设置下提供了一种简单、模型无关且标签高效的方法，能够利用输出端数据并保持可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce Bridged Clustering, a semi-supervised framework to learn
predictors from any unpaired input $X$ and output $Y$ dataset. Our method first
clusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge
between clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input
$x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked
output cluster is returned as the prediction $\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL,
Bridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense
transport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment.
Through theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and
mis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor.
Empirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining
simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，对大语言模型的投毒攻击只需要恒定数量的恶意文档（约250个），而不随模型大小或训练数据量增加而增加，这揭示了大型模型可能比预期更容易受到投毒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设攻击者需要控制一定比例的训练数据，但对大型模型而言，即使很小比例也意味着不切实际的大量数据。本文旨在验证投毒攻击是否真的需要与数据集大小成比例的恶意数据。

Method: 进行了迄今为止最大规模的预训练投毒实验，训练了从6亿到130亿参数的模型，使用Chinchilla最优数据集（60亿到2600亿tokens）。同时进行了小规模实验来研究影响攻击成功的因素。

Result: 发现250个投毒文档就能在所有模型和数据规模上造成类似的损害，即使最大的模型训练了超过20倍的干净数据。在微调阶段也观察到相同的动态。

Conclusion: 通过数据投毒注入后门可能比之前认为的更容易，因为所需的投毒数量不随模型规模扩大而增加，这凸显了需要更多研究来开发防御措施以减轻未来模型中的这种风险。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs)
by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has
studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the
training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to
impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time
that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents
regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning
experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on
chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned
documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,
despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We
also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence
attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and
non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same
dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that
injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than
previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with
model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate
this risk in future models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了宽度为n和n+1的ReLU神经网络在逼近特定反例函数时的表现，分析了深度变化对逼近质量的影响，特别是神经元死亡现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hanin和Sellke在2017年证明了当且仅当宽度w>n时，ReLU神经网络才能在紧集上一致逼近连续函数。本文旨在研究在临界宽度w=n和w=n+1时，神经网络如何逼近该反例函数。

Method: 通过构建具体的神经网络，在宽度w=n和w=n+1两种情况下逼近Hanin和Sellke使用的反例函数，并分析不同深度下的逼近质量变化。

Result: 研究发现神经网络在临界宽度下的逼近质量受深度影响，并观察到神经元死亡现象对逼近行为的影响。

Conclusion: 即使在临界宽度w=n和w=n+1时，神经网络也能在一定程度上逼近反例函数，但逼近质量受到深度和神经元死亡现象的限制。

Abstract: In 2017, Hanin and Sellke showed that the class of arbitrarily deep,
real-valued, feed-forward and ReLU-activated networks of width w forms a dense
subset of the space of continuous functions on R^n, with respect to the
topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, if and only if w>n holds. To
show the necessity, a concrete counterexample function f:R^n->R was used. In
this note we actually approximate this very f by neural networks in the two
cases w=n and w=n+1 around the aforementioned threshold. We study how the
approximation quality behaves if we vary the depth and what effect (spoiler
alert: dying neurons) cause that behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管混合专家架构在现代AI系统中广泛应用，但其训练动态的理论理解仍局限于分离的专家-路由器优化或特定构造的数据集场景，需要更全面的理论分析。

Method: 在师生框架下分析软路由MoE模型的联合训练，使用非线性路由器和专家，证明在适度过参数化条件下的收敛性。

Result: 证明了学生网络能通过特征学习阶段恢复教师网络参数，路由器学习过程由专家引导，训练后剪枝能有效消除冗余神经元，微调过程能收敛到全局最优。

Conclusion: 这是首个深入理解MoE架构优化景观的分析，为软路由MoE模型的训练提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a cornerstone of
modern AI systems. In particular, MoEs route inputs dynamically to specialized
experts whose outputs are aggregated through weighted summation. Despite their
widespread application, theoretical understanding of MoE training dynamics
remains limited to either separate expert-router optimization or only top-1
routing scenarios with carefully constructed datasets. This paper advances MoE
theory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed
MoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework.
We prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student network
undergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is
``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters. Moreover, we
show that a post-training pruning can effectively eliminate redundant neurons,
followed by a provably convergent fine-tuning process that reaches global
optimality. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to bring novel insights
in understanding the optimization landscape of the MoE architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了Thompson Sampling作为在线优化算法的本质，通过引入"忠实"平稳化方法，将有限时域动态优化问题转换为平稳对应问题，解释了Thompson Sampling如何平衡探索与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Thompson Sampling被广泛使用和研究，但其通过后验采样来"恰当"平衡探索与利用的确切机制仍然是个谜。本文旨在揭示这一核心机制。

Method: 引入"忠实"平稳化方法，将有限时域动态优化问题转换为平稳对应问题，使用Bellman原理研究时间不变最优策略，将Thompson Sampling重新表述为在线优化形式。

Result: 发现Thompson Sampling具有简单的在线优化形式，模仿Bellman最优策略结构，其中贪婪性通过基于点二列相关性的剩余不确定性度量进行正则化。

Conclusion: 这回答了Thompson Sampling如何平衡探索与利用的问题，并为研究和改进Thompson原始思想提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit
algorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid
theoretical guarantees. Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit
algorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced
by Thompson) is able to "properly" balance exploration and exploitation,
remains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this
question stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization
algorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer
to as "faithful" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the
finite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary
counterpart which "closely resembles" the original objective (in contrast, the
classical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins
index, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly
crafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which
leads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,
Thompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the
structure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by
a measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This
answers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances
exploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to
study and further improve Thompson's original idea.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了判别性特征反馈（DFF）学习协议的理论性质，分析了其在可实现和不可实现设置下的最优错误界限，并与在线学习等经典协议进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFF协议使用判别性特征解释作为反馈，但缺乏与经典学习协议（如监督学习和在线学习）框架下的系统理论研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，深入理解DFF的理论特性。

Method: 在一般框架下研究DFF协议，分析可实现和不可实现设置下的错误界限，引入新的维度概念来刻画可实现设置下的错误界限，并提供不可实现设置下的错误上界。

Result: 在可实现设置中，使用新维度概念刻画了错误界限；在不可实现设置中，给出了错误上界并证明其一般不可改进。结果显示DFF与在线学习不同，可实现维度不足以刻画最优不可实现错误界限或无遗憾算法的存在性。

Conclusion: DFF协议与在线学习存在本质差异，可实现维度在DFF中不足以完全表征学习性能，这揭示了具有丰富反馈的学习设置与经典在线学习之间的重要区别。

Abstract: We study the theoretical properties of the interactive learning protocol
Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) (Dasgupta et al., 2018). The DFF learning
protocol uses feedback in the form of discriminative feature explanations. We
provide the first systematic study of DFF in a general framework that is
comparable to that of classical protocols such as supervised learning and
online learning. We study the optimal mistake bound of DFF in the realizable
and the non-realizable settings, and obtain novel structural results, as well
as insights into the differences between Online Learning and settings with
richer feedback such as DFF. We characterize the mistake bound in the
realizable setting using a new notion of dimension. In the non-realizable
setting, we provide a mistake upper bound and show that it cannot be improved
in general. Our results show that unlike Online Learning, in DFF the realizable
dimension is insufficient to characterize the optimal non-realizable mistake
bound or the existence of no-regret algorithms.

TL;DR: TTGS是一种轻量级规划方法，通过构建数据集状态图并搜索子目标序列来改进离线目标导向强化学习的长期决策能力，无需训练修改或额外监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标导向强化学习在长期决策中存在时间信用分配和错误累积问题，离线设置会放大这些效应，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: TTGS接受任何状态空间距离或成本信号，构建数据集状态加权图，执行快速搜索来组装子目标序列，由冻结策略执行。对于基于值的基学习器，距离直接从学习的目标导向价值函数推导。

Result: 在OGBench基准测试中，TTGS提高了多个基学习器在具有挑战性的运动任务上的成功率。

Conclusion: 简单的度量引导测试时规划对离线GCRL有益，TTGS无需训练修改、额外监督、在线交互或特权信息，完全在推理时运行。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that
reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,
domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free
datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL
agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the
offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the
GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a
weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a
sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is
value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned
value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to
training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged
information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS
improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion
tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for
offline GCRL.

Motivation: 解决在线全预测问题中，学习者需要为多个下游决策者生成预测序列，这些决策者各有不同的效用函数和约束函数，目标是让所有决策者都能获得最坏情况效用保证并最小化约束违反。

Method: 设计了一种算法，为所有智能体同时获得动态遗憾保证，其中每个智能体的遗憾都是相对于交互回合中可能变化的动作序列来衡量的，同时确保每个智能体的约束违反趋近于零。

Result: 该算法是首个能够同时为所有智能体获得动态遗憾保证的方法，且不需要智能体自身维护任何状态，只需解决由每轮预测定义的单轮约束优化问题。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在在线全预测框架下实现了同时的动态遗憾保证和约束违反控制，为多智能体决策系统提供了有效的预测解决方案。

Abstract: We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online
omniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced
problem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are
broadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker
has their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions,
each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or
constraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "as
if" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to
produce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions
that give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case
constraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that
obtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --
where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence
of actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing
constraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents
themselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained
optimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.

Conclusion: GTCN-G框架有效整合时空特征，通过残差机制成功解决类别不平衡问题，为网络入侵检测提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance
in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological
structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in
capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates
both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal
Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these
limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting
hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core
innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,
implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves
original feature information through residual connections, which is critical
for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity
for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to
validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming
existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Result: 在ProteinGym基准测试(217个突变实验，>250万个突变体)中，EvoIF及其MSA增强变体达到最先进或竞争性性能，仅使用0.15%训练数据和较少参数。消融实验证实两种进化信号具有互补性。

Conclusion: EvoIF提供了一种高效且可解释的蛋白质突变适应性预测方法，通过整合多尺度进化信息实现了优越性能，为蛋白质工程提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering
but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.
Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)
exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by
interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert
demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this
perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two
complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from
retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints
distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure
representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding
calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational
assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the
training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm
that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving
robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

*Xingtong Yu,Chang Zhou,Xinming Zhang,Yuan Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolGA是一种将预训练的2D图编码器适配到下游分子应用的方法，通过灵活整合多种分子领域知识来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练2D图编码器忽略了与亚分子实例相关的丰富分子领域知识，而专门的分子预训练方法又缺乏整合多样化知识的灵活性。

Method: 提出了分子对齐策略来弥合预训练拓扑表示与领域知识表示之间的差距，并引入了条件适配机制来生成实例特定的标记以实现细粒度的知识整合。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了MolGA的有效性。

Conclusion: MolGA提供了一种实用的替代方案，能够在保持预训练2D编码器优势的同时，灵活整合分子领域知识以提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and
biomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated
strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge
associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular
pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training
objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of
knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in
molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D
encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream
adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose
MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular
applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.
First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between
pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.
Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates
instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain
knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on
eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLE-Smith是一个全自动多智能体流水线，通过生成-验证-执行范式将原始数据集转化为竞赛式机器学习工程挑战，解决了现有MLE基准测试可扩展性差和适用性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLE基准测试依赖静态、手动策划的任务，制作耗时且费力，导致高质量MLE训练数据获取受限。需要一种自动化方法来扩展MLE任务，同时保证质量和多样性。

Method: 采用多智能体流水线进行结构化任务设计和标准化重构，结合混合验证机制强制执行严格的结构规则和高级语义合理性，并通过交互式执行验证经验可解性和真实世界保真度。

Result: 在224个真实世界数据集上生成了606个任务，涵盖多个类别、目标和模态。评估显示主流LLM在MLE-Smith任务上的表现与在人工设计任务上的表现高度相关。

Conclusion: MLE-Smith能够有效扩展MLE任务规模，同时保持任务质量，为机器学习工程提供了可扩展且高质量的基准测试生成方案。

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating
machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE
training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from
low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually
curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We
introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw
datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient
generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,
real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in
MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled
with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and
high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and
real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of
real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,
objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively
across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks
shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on
MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully
human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to
scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用现有短视距数据来提升语言模型长视距推理能力的方法，通过将简单问题组合成复杂的多步依赖链，并采用基于结果的奖励和自动增加复杂度的课程学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖推理时支架或昂贵的步骤级监督，难以扩展。需要一种仅使用现有丰富短视距数据就能提升长视距推理能力的可扩展方法。

Method: 将简单问题合成复杂多步依赖链，使用仅结果奖励在自动增加复杂度的课程下进行强化学习训练。

Result: 在6年级数学问题上训练后，在更长竞赛级基准测试上的准确率提升高达2.06倍，长视距改进显著高于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用现有数据扩展强化学习处理长视距问题提供了高效路径，理论上样本复杂度相比全视距训练有指数级改进。

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance
drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this
rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of
which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap
long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon
data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,
multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data
using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in
complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.
Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on
composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,
competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.
Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than
baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning
paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards
achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon
training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1
therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon
problems using only existing data.

*Yong Oh Lee,Byeonghun Bang,Sejun Oh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出并评估了一个基于大语言模型的评分框架，用于评估学生在代数能力和现实情境编程任务中的表现，该框架与专家评分高度一致且能提供过程导向的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育平台需要不仅能测量答案准确性，还能捕捉学生认知过程深度的评估方法，以符合课程目标。

Method: 设计了一个基于评分标准的评估框架，使用LLM评估学生解决问题的正确性和质量，并在在线平台上实施，收集中间响应并使用LLM进行评分标准对齐的成就评估。

Result: LLM基于的评分评估与专家判断高度一致，并持续产生评分标准对齐、过程导向的反馈。

Conclusion: 将LLM驱动的评分评估整合到在线数学和STEM教育平台中具有有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: As online education platforms continue to expand, there is a growing need for
assessment methods that not only measure answer accuracy but also capture the
depth of students' cognitive processes in alignment with curriculum objectives.
This study proposes and evaluates a rubric-based assessment framework powered
by a large language model (LLM) for measuring algebraic competence,
real-world-context block coding tasks. The problem set, designed by mathematics
education experts, aligns each problem segment with five predefined rubric
dimensions, enabling the LLM to assess both correctness and quality of
students' problem-solving processes. The system was implemented on an online
platform that records all intermediate responses and employs the LLM for
rubric-aligned achievement evaluation. To examine the practical effectiveness
of the proposed framework, we conducted a field study involving 42 middle
school students engaged in multi-stage quadratic equation tasks with block
coding. The study integrated learner self-assessments and expert ratings to
benchmark the system's outputs. The LLM-based rubric evaluation showed strong
agreement with expert judgments and consistently produced rubric-aligned,
process-oriented feedback. These results demonstrate both the validity and
scalability of incorporating LLM-driven rubric assessment into online
mathematics and STEM education platforms.

TL;DR: 提出离线RAG管道，将小型语言模型与检索机制结合，为低资源环境提供无需联网的教育AI助手，解决LLM在教育中的计算需求问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在教育中具有潜力，但高计算需求限制了在低资源环境的使用，加剧了教育不平等。需要解决离线环境下的AI教育工具部署问题。

Method: 使用离线检索增强生成(RAG)管道，将小型语言模型与强大的检索机制配对，基于特定领域教育内容(生物学课程)进行评估。

Result: 分析发现小型模型(SmolLM)难以有效利用RAG管道提供的扩展上下文，特别是在包含噪声或不相关文本块时。性能有待提升。

Conclusion: 证明了在受限环境中部署AI导师的可行性，为公平、离线和基于设备的教育工具奠定了基础。建议探索先进分块技术、量化模型和更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education offers
significant potential to enhance accessibility and engagement, yet their high
computational demands limit usability in low-resource settings, exacerbating
educational inequities. To address this, we propose an offline
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that pairs a small language model
(SLM) with a robust retrieval mechanism, enabling factual, contextually
relevant responses without internet connectivity. We evaluate the efficacy of
this pipeline using domain-specific educational content, focusing on biology
coursework. Our analysis highlights key challenges: smaller models, such as
SmolLM, struggle to effectively leverage extended contexts provided by the RAG
pipeline, particularly when noisy or irrelevant chunks are included. To improve
performance, we propose exploring advanced chunking techniques, alternative
small or quantized versions of larger models, and moving beyond traditional
metrics like MMLU to a holistic evaluation framework assessing free-form
response. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying AI tutors in
constrained environments, laying the groundwork for equitable, offline, and
device-based educational tools.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应公平联邦学习(AFFL)框架，通过动态知识传递、公平感知蒸馏和课程引导加速，解决医疗AI在隐私保护协作学习中的公平性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI面临隐私保护协作学习的挑战，现有联邦学习方法存在静态架构、收敛缓慢、公平性差距和可扩展性限制等问题，特别是小型医疗机构在协作中容易被边缘化。

Method: 采用三个创新方法：(1)自适应知识传递器根据异构性和任务复杂度动态扩展容量；(2)公平感知蒸馏使用影响加权聚合；(3)课程引导加速将训练轮次减少60-70%。

Result: 理论分析提供收敛保证和epsilon公平性边界，预计实现55-75%通信减少、56-68%公平性提升、34-46%能耗节省，支持100+机构规模。

Conclusion: 该框架支持多模态数据集成，保持HIPAA/GDPR合规性，提出了MedFedBench基准套件和7个研究问题，旨在实现医疗AI的民主化。

Abstract: Medical AI faces challenges in privacy-preserving collaborative learning
while ensuring fairness across heterogeneous healthcare institutions. Current
federated learning approaches suffer from static architectures, slow
convergence (45-73 rounds), fairness gaps marginalizing smaller institutions,
and scalability constraints (15-client limit). We propose Adaptive Fair
Federated Learning (AFFL) through three innovations: (1) Adaptive Knowledge
Messengers dynamically scaling capacity based on heterogeneity and task
complexity, (2) Fairness-Aware Distillation using influence-weighted
aggregation, and (3) Curriculum-Guided Acceleration reducing rounds by 60-70%.
Our theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees with epsilon-fairness
bounds, achieving O(T^{-1/2}) + O(H_max/T^{3/4}) rates. Projected results show
55-75% communication reduction, 56-68% fairness improvement, 34-46% energy
savings, and 100+ institution support. The framework enables multi-modal
integration across imaging, genomics, EHR, and sensor data while maintaining
HIPAA/GDPR compliance. We propose MedFedBench benchmark suite for standardized
evaluation across six healthcare dimensions: convergence efficiency,
institutional fairness, privacy preservation, multi-modal integration,
scalability, and clinical deployment readiness. Economic projections indicate
400-800% ROI for rural hospitals and 15-25% performance gains for academic
centers. This work presents a seven-question research agenda, 24-month
implementation roadmap, and pathways toward democratizing healthcare AI.

*Lawrence Feldman,Matthew Bomparola*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Safe3Step (S3S) 是一个改进 NCAA 男子一级长曲棍球锦标赛球队选拔的系统，它通过三个步骤评估球队实力、基于胜败质量分配积分并考虑直接交锋记录来排名球队。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发 S3S 的目的是改进现有的评分百分比指数 (RPI)，通过与 NCAA 长曲棍球选拔标准和排名委员会合作，创建更简单、透明和客观的选拔系统。

Method: S3S 采用三个步骤：1) 基于比分数据评估球队实力；2) 根据胜败质量分配 S3S 积分并排名；3) 检查相邻排名球队的直接交锋记录，必要时交换排名。

Result: S3S 改进了其他"高质量胜利"方法，通过使用实力评分识别球队强度、尊重直接交锋记录，并保持简单性、透明度和客观性标准。

Conclusion: Safe3Step 提供了一个改进的 NCAA 长曲棍球锦标赛球队选拔框架，但实证分析留待未来工作完成。

Abstract: This document describes a system for selecting teams to the NCAA Men's
Division I Lacrosse Championship Tournament called "Safe3Step" (S3S) that was
developed in conversation with the NCAA Lacrosse Selection Criteria and Ranking
Committee (SCR) with the objective of improving on the Ratings Percentage Index
(RPI). S3S employs three steps that: 1) evaluate the strength of each team
based on score data, 2) award S3S points to each team based on the quality of
its wins and losses, ranking teams accordingly, and 3) examine each pair of
teams with adjacent rankings, swapping ranks if the lower-ranked team has a
better head-to-head record against the higher-ranked team. Safe3Step is not
entirely new, but it improves on other "quality win" methods by using Power
Ratings to identify team strengths, respecting head-to-head records, and
adhering to standards of simplicity, transparency, and objectivity. Empirical
analysis is left to future work.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型从网络规模数据中学习并反映了医疗职业与人口统计属性之间的刻板关联，这些偏见在医疗等关键领域可能对公平性、合规性和患者信任产生下游影响。

Method: 定义了涵盖临床医生和相关医疗角色的分类法，策划了职业感知提示套件来探测模型行为，并使用平衡人脸语料库对人口统计偏差进行基准测试。

Result: 实证研究发现，在多个角色和视觉模型中观察到一致的人口统计偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医疗等关键领域识别偏见的重要性，因为AI驱动的招聘和劳动力分析可能对公平性、合规性和患者信任产生深远影响。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and OpenCLIP, can encode and
reflect stereotypical associations between medical professions and demographic
attributes learned from web-scale data. We present an evaluation protocol for
healthcare settings that quantifies associated biases and assesses their
operational risk. Our methodology (i) defines a taxonomy spanning clinicians
and allied healthcare roles (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, dentist, nurse,
pharmacist, technician), (ii) curates a profession-aware prompt suite to probe
model behavior, and (iii) benchmarks demographic skew against a balanced face
corpus. Empirically, we observe consistent demographic biases across multiple
roles and vision models. Our work highlights the importance of bias
identification in critical domains such as healthcare as AI-enabled hiring and
workforce analytics can have downstream implications for equity, compliance,
and patient trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社区的规则差异大、变化快且执行不一致，给透明度、治理和自动化带来挑战，需要建模规则与执行之间的关系。

Method: 提出ModQ问答框架，在推理时基于完整社区规则集，识别给定评论最适用的规则。实现提取式和多项选择式两种模型变体。

Result: 两种模型在识别与审核相关的规则违反方面均优于最先进的基线方法，同时保持轻量级和可解释性，能有效泛化到未见过的社区和规则。

Conclusion: ModQ框架支持低资源审核设置和动态治理环境，为规则敏感的内容审核提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Online communities rely on a mix of platform policies and community-authored
rules to define acceptable behavior and maintain order. However, these rules
vary widely across communities, evolve over time, and are enforced
inconsistently, posing challenges for transparency, governance, and automation.
In this paper, we model the relationship between rules and their enforcement at
scale, introducing ModQ, a novel question-answering framework for
rule-sensitive content moderation. Unlike prior classification or
generation-based approaches, ModQ conditions on the full set of community rules
at inference time and identifies which rule best applies to a given comment. We
implement two model variants - extractive and multiple-choice QA - and train
them on large-scale datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, the latter of which we
construct from publicly available moderation logs and rule descriptions. Both
models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying moderation-relevant
rule violations, while remaining lightweight and interpretable. Notably, ModQ
models generalize effectively to unseen communities and rules, supporting
low-resource moderation settings and dynamic governance environments.

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管用户倾向于将AI工具视为类人模型（Model H），但增加提示语的具体性并不能提高ChatGPT评估学生作业的一致性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证用户将AI视为类人模型（Model H）的假设，即增加提示语的具体性应该像人类评估者一样减少性能方差。

Method: 通过控制实验，使用四种不同具体程度的提示语让ChatGPT评估29份学生作业，并通过Cohen's Kappa测量评估者内部信度来评估一致性。

Result: 与预期相反，增加提示语的具体性并没有显著提高评估性能的一致性，性能方差基本保持不变。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了LLMs行为类似人类评估者的假设，强调了未来模型开发中需要更强的鲁棒性和改进的输入集成能力。

Abstract: Many users interact with AI tools like ChatGPT using a mental model that
treats the system as human-like, which we call Model H. According to
goal-setting theory, increased specificity in goals should reduce performance
variance. If Model H holds, then prompting a chatbot with more detailed
instructions should lead to more consistent evaluation behavior.
  This paper tests that assumption through a controlled experiment in which
ChatGPT evaluated 29 student submissions using four prompts with increasing
specificity. We measured consistency using intra-rater reliability (Cohen's
Kappa) across repeated runs.
  Contrary to expectations, performance did not improve consistently with
increased prompt specificity, and performance variance remained largely
unchanged. These findings challenge the assumption that LLMs behave like human
evaluators and highlight the need for greater robustness and improved input
integration in future model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数毕业生进入行业时缺乏理解大型软件系统的准备，需要提升新员工对现有软件系统的理解能力。

Method: 在入职培训中集成五次会议课程，教授系统思维和标记转换系统(LTS)建模，使用结构化模板表达产品行为理解，并进行前后匹配评估。

Result: 35名新员工中31人提供配对记录。整体提升较小且不显著，但预备测试低于中位数的参与者平均提升15个百分点(显著)，高于中位数的参与者略有退步(不显著)。课程反馈显示高参与度和感知适用性。

Conclusion: 短期建模导向的入职干预可以加速预备知识较弱新员工的理解能力，但需要为较强参与者提供差异化路径，公司可大规模采用此类低成本补充措施。

Abstract: Working effectively with large, existing software systems requires strong
comprehension skills, yet most graduates enter the industry with little
preparation for this challenge. We report early results from a pilot
intervention integrated into a SaaS company's onboarding program: a
five-session course introducing systems thinking and Labelled Transition System
(LTS) modelling. Participants articulated their understanding of product
behaviour using a structured template and completed matched pre- and
post-assessments. Of 35 new hires, 31 provided paired records for analysis.
Across the full cohort, gains were small and not statistically significant.
However, participants below the median on the pre-test improved by 15
percentage points on average (statistically significant), while those above the
median regressed slightly (not statistically significant). Course feedback
indicated high engagement and perceived applicability. These results suggest
that short, modelling-focused onboarding interventions can accelerate
comprehension for less-prepared new hires. At the same time, they point to the
need for differentiated pathways for stronger participants, and to the
potential for companies to adopt such interventions at scale as a low-cost
complement to existing onboarding.

(OEIAC, UG), with the participation of Vanina Martinez-Posse (IIIA-CSIC),
Eulalia Soler (Eurecat) and Pompeu Casanovas (IIIA-CSIC) on July 4th 2025.
Albert Sabater posed three questions: (1) How can regulatory frameworks
priori-tise the protection of fundamental rights (privacy, non-discrimination,
autonomy, etc.) in the development of AI, without falling into the false
dichotomy between regulation and innova-tion? (2) Given the risks of AI (bias,
mass surveillance, manipulation), what examples of regu-lations or policies
have demonstrated that it is possible to foster responsible innovation, putting
the public interest before profitability, without giving in to competitive
pressure from actors such as China or the US? (3) In a scenario where the US
prioritizes flexibility, what mecha-nisms could ensure that international
cooperation in AI does not become a race to the bottom in rights, but rather a
global standard of accountability? The article attempts to answer these three
questions and concludes with some reflections on the relevance of the answers
for education and research.

Motivation: 解决基础模型推理能力的内在局限性以及测试时迭代不可靠的问题，提升模型的推理能力和可靠性。

Method: 通过编排多个模型和专业工具（Python计算工具和检索工具）实现深思熟虑、可验证的推理，使用共享状态地图支持多轮、多模型的解决方案演化。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025评估中，AlphaApollo为Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct带来+5.15% Average@32和+23.34% Pass@32的提升，为Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct带来+8.91% Average@32和+26.67% Pass@32的提升，工具调用成功率超过80%。

Conclusion: AlphaApollo系统通过工具集成和多模型协作有效提升了基础模型的能力上限，实现了更可靠的推理性能。

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical
and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external
information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system
further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了复杂性分布外泛化框架来定义和衡量推理能力，强调当测试实例所需的最小解复杂度超过所有训练样本时，模型仍能保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在推理能力方面缺乏清晰、一致的定义和度量标准，需要建立正式框架来区分和评估System1和System2推理。

Method: 通过解描述的Kolmogorov复杂性和操作代理来形式化复杂度，区分复杂性OoD与长度和组合OoD，提出在基准设计、监督方式、归纳偏置等方面的实践建议。

Result: 建立了统一学习和推理的视角，许多在低复杂度下可用System1处理的情况在复杂度压力下需要System2，而System2可视为对解结构的泛化。

Conclusion: 复杂性OoD不能仅通过扩展数据解决，需要明确建模和分配计算的架构和训练机制来实现稳健推理。

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

TL;DR: 提出了BuilderBench基准，用于评估智能体通过开放式探索学习构建结构的能力，包含42个多样化目标结构和硬件加速模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型主要通过模仿学习，难以解决超出已有数据范围的新问题。需要开发能够通过交互经验学习的智能体，但缺乏可扩展的学习机制。

Method: 构建BuilderBench基准，包含物理块模拟器和任务套件，智能体在无外部监督下探索学习环境原理，然后评估构建未见目标结构的能力。

Result: 实验表明当前算法在这些任务上面临挑战，因此提供了"训练轮"协议和六种算法的单文件实现作为参考。

Conclusion: BuilderBench为促进智能体预训练研究提供了重要基准，需要体现推理能力，通过行动而非语言来实验不同策略并整合它们。

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

Abstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统中的共识寻求方法依赖投票机制，忽视了系统内部信念的矛盾，且采用无差别的合作方式，无法形成稳定共识。

Method: 基于理论框架选择最优合作者，提出信念校准共识寻求(BCCS)框架，通过选择最优合作者和校准系统内部信念来促进稳定共识。

Result: 在MATH和MMLU基准数据集上，BCCS框架在挑战性任务上的准确率分别比现有最佳结果提高了2.23%和3.95%。

Conclusion: BCCS框架通过选择最优合作者和校准系统内部信念，有效解决了多智能体系统中共识不稳定的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/dengwentao99/BCCS.

*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，标准单模型推理训练无法产生有效的离轨迹推理行为，更强的LLM在干扰下反而更脆弱，所有模型都无法有效利用协作推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多个推理模型能否在共享推理轨迹中直接协作，这需要模型具备评估和基于其他模型部分推理的能力（离轨迹推理）。

Method: 提出双测试：可恢复性（测试模型从误导推理轨迹中回溯的能力）和可引导性（测试模型基于更强协作者正确推理的能力），评估15个开源LLM（1.5B-32B）。

Result: 更强的LLM在基准测试中表现更好，但在干扰下更脆弱；所有模型在超出自身能力的问题上利用引导步骤的解决率低于9.2%。

Conclusion: 标准推理训练流程无法产生理想的离轨迹推理行为，需要专门训练原生强推理协作者，教师模型的不佳可恢复性行为会传递给蒸馏学生。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究创建了一个知识图谱，将食物与健康联系起来，重点关注类黄酮含量与癌症的关系，使用KNARM方法构建机器可操作的标准化表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前很少有研究使用语义网以标准化、机器可读的格式表示食物与健康的关系，这限制了相关知识的有效利用。

Method: 利用知识图谱整合来自USDA数据库的食物类黄酮含量信息和文献中的癌症关联数据，采用KNARM方法构建关系表示。

Result: 成功创建了一个知识图谱，能够以机器可操作的格式表示食物与健康之间的复杂关系，为研究人员提供了探索饮食选择与疾病管理关系的基础。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱为研究食物与健康关系提供了有效工具，未来工作将扩展图谱范围、添加更多相关数据并进行推理以发现隐藏关系。

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and
generalization for foundation models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理的LLM管道来研究智能搜索中的有效推理行为模式，识别了四种有益推理行为，并通过行为引导技术训练更有效的智能搜索模型，在多个基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能搜索利用LLM解释复杂用户信息需求并执行多步骤的规划、搜索和合成过程，这为LLM在与检索系统和网络交互时的推理和智能能力带来了独特挑战。

Method: 提出了推理驱动的LLM管道分析成功智能搜索轨迹，识别了四种有益推理行为：信息验证、权威性评估、自适应搜索和错误恢复。基于这些发现，提出了行为引导技术，通过监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）训练更有效的智能搜索模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试（GAIA、WebWalker和HLE）上，行为引导技术在Llama3.2-3B和Qwen3-1.7B上相比直接使用RL训练智能搜索模型获得了超过35%的性能提升。关键发现是SFT数据中期望的推理行为，而非最终答案的正确性，是RL后获得强最终性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: 引入的推理行为赋予模型更有效的探索能力和测试时扩展能力，为强化学习提供了坚实基础。SFT数据中期望推理行为的存在比答案正确性更重要。

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

TL;DR: 提出Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE)框架，通过自动学习评估维度来提升LLM法官的可靠性，在零样本设置下将GPT-4o在Reward Bench上的协议率从87.2%提升到90.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM法官经常遗漏关键评估维度，因为它们无法识别人类评估背后的隐含标准，导致评估可靠性不足。

Method: 提出自适应框架APE，自动从失败案例中学习评估维度，采用基于置信度的集成机制，通过新颖的集体置信度估计方法决定何时采用额外评估维度的判断。

Result: 广泛实验表明，APE在多个标准基准测试中显著提升了LLM法官的可靠性，特别是在Reward Bench上实现了协议率的显著提升。

Conclusion: APE为LLM法官提供了一种原则性方法来利用测试时计算，弥合了人类与LLM法官之间的评估差距。

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在处理需要长视野导航、大规模信息提取和约束推理的复杂网页任务时表现不佳，需要更有效的框架来应对这些挑战。

Method: 将复杂任务动态分解为三个专注子任务（导航、信息提取、执行），并随着网页内容揭示持续重新规划，利用新发现的过滤器和捷径。

Result: 在WebChoreArena上比之前SOTA代理提升成功率13.7个百分点，在WebArena上保持同等性能，且导航步骤减少达14.7步。

Conclusion: WebDART框架通过任务分解和动态重规划，有效解决了LLM代理在复杂网页任务中的挑战，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

Conclusion: 基于原型理论的情感上下文学习能有效改进细粒度情感识别的决策过程，通过情感相似示例和动态优化策略提升性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

Motivation: 传统的离线批量标注方法效率低下，无法快速迭代改进LLM客服系统。需要将人类反馈直接嵌入到运营工作流中，实现持续的数据飞轮效应。

Method: AITL框架集成四种实时标注：响应偏好对比、客服采纳及理由、知识相关性检查、缺失知识识别，这些反馈信号直接用于模型更新。

Result: 生产试点显示检索准确率显著提升（召回率+11.7%，精确率+14.8%），生成质量提高（帮助性+8.4%），客服采纳率增加4.5%。

Conclusion: 将人类反馈循环直接嵌入运营工作流能有效持续改进基于LLM的客服系统，证明了实时反馈机制的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational
workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动设计代理系统的元代理方法在实际应用中的关键挑战，包括学习效率、行为多样性和经济成本问题。

Method: 通过实验比较不同的学习策略（全上下文vs忽略先前设计vs进化方法），评估代理行为多样性，分析设计成本与部署规模的经济效益。

Result: 进化方法优于全上下文方法；设计的代理行为多样性低；仅在少数数据集上自动化设计在经济上可行。

Conclusion: 当前元代理方法在跨迭代学习、行为多样性和经济可行性方面存在显著限制，需要改进才能在实际应用中发挥价值。

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

Result: 构建的MultiCNKG包含6.9K个节点（5种类型）和11.3K条边（7种类型），在精度（85.20%）、召回率（87.30%）、覆盖率（92.18%）等指标上表现优异，链接预测性能与FB15k-237和WN18RR基准相当。

Conclusion: MultiCNKG知识图谱为个性化医疗、认知障碍诊断和认知神经科学假设制定提供了有力工具，展示了LLM在生物医学知识图谱整合中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

TL;DR: 开发了一个自动化工具，用于验证基于LLM的策略在无记忆顺序决策任务中的安全性，通过增量构建MDP模型并使用Storm模型检查器验证PCTL安全属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在顺序决策任务中的应用增加，需要确保这些基于LLM的策略能够满足安全要求，但目前缺乏系统性的验证方法。

Method: 给定MDP、LLM策略和PCTL安全要求，增量构建可达的MDP状态空间，将状态编码为自然语言提示，解析LLM响应为动作，扩展可达后继状态，最后使用Storm模型检查器验证安全属性。

Result: 实验表明开源LLM在确定性种子下可被验证，但性能普遍低于深度强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工具与Ollama原生集成，支持PRISM规范的任务，为验证日益强大的LLM奠定了实用基础。

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化端到端科学研究过程面临双重挑战：需要制定新颖且合理的高层计划，并在动态不确定条件下正确执行这些计划

Method: 双循环多智能体框架：领导者循环（教授智能体）使用进化算法通过参与、改进和整合会议迭代生成研究提案；跟随者循环（博士生智能体）通过事前和事后会议动态调整计划执行

Result: 在ACLAward和Laboratory基准测试中，DLMA生成的研究论文在自动评估中达到最先进分数，显著优于强基线方法

Conclusion: 消融研究证实了两个循环的关键作用：进化驱动新颖性，执行确保合理性

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

Motivation: 现有形式化模型在生成语法有效且语义一致的正式陈述方面仍存在困难

Method: 结合Lean 4编译器进行语法修正，采用多LLM判断进行一致性验证，通过工具反馈自适应优化生成结果

Result: ATF显著优于基线模型，在人类评估中表现优异，并展现出良好的推理扩展性

Conclusion: ATF方法有效提升了自动形式化的质量，开源Numina-ATF数据集促进相关研究发展

Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into
formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large
language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

TL;DR: TGPR结合GRPO与Thompson采样树搜索，通过主动探索失败和成功的精化路径，在代码调试任务上显著提升了LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代精化方法依赖预定义启发式，面临探索-利用困境且无法根据过去结果自适应调整。

Method: 提出Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR)框架，将GRPO与基于Thompson采样的树搜索相结合，主动探索精化路径。

Result: 在HumanEval、MBPP和APPS基准测试中，相比GRPO基线，pass@1最高提升4.2个百分点(MBPP)，pass@10最高提升12.51个百分点(APPS)。

Conclusion: TGPR为结合学习策略与结构化搜索提供了原则性方法，是增强LLM迭代精化和状态推理的通用框架。

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AJAN框架虽然基于语义Web标准构建多智能体系统，但RDF/RDFS和SPARQL的定义过程复杂且容易出错，URI处理和复杂查询的学习曲线较高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 开发了一个集成开发环境，通过集成大型语言模型来辅助智能体工程，简化RDF/RDFS和SPARQL的使用过程。

Result: 该环境降低了AJAN智能体建模的技术门槛，使非专业用户也能更容易地使用该框架。

Conclusion: 提出的集成开发环境有效解决了AJAN框架使用中的技术障碍，扩展了用户群体，使多智能体系统的开发更加便捷。

Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究验证了在大型语言模型推理轨迹中，步骤级别的信息密度均匀性与推理质量的关系，提出了基于熵的度量方法，发现正确推理轨迹避免信息密度尖峰，选择均匀信息密度轨迹可显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视统一信息密度假说在LLM推理轨迹中的应用，探究步骤级别的信息密度均匀性是否能反映推理质量。

Method: 提出基于熵的步骤信息密度度量方法，引入局部和全局均匀性评分两个互补的均匀性度量指标。

Result: 在六个推理基准测试中，步骤级别的均匀性不仅提供理论视角，还带来实际性能提升：选择信息密度更均匀的推理轨迹在AIME2025上相对基线提高准确率10-32%。正确推理轨迹避免信息密度尖峰，错误轨迹则呈现不规则信息爆发。

Conclusion: UID启发的信息密度度量优于其他内部信号作为推理质量预测指标，信息密度均匀性可作为构建更可靠准确推理系统的稳健诊断和选择标准。

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 结合高级推理与工具使用在知识密集型和计算密集型任务中具有显著潜力，能够提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了LLM同质化问题，通过多智能体方法有效捕捉了人类多样性，为使用LLM作为人类行为代理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

Result: 发现动作空间规模扩大时存在表示选择拐点，更强的规划能力使拐点右移，更好的模式实例化能力使拐点左移。基于模式的规划(PwS)智能体表现次优。

Conclusion: 需要可扩展的动作表示方法，提供了构建更强大PwS智能体的实用指南，以实现更好的可扩展自主性。

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to
meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to
maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement
learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven
embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate
the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

TL;DR: NewtonBench是一个包含324个科学定律发现任务的基准测试，覆盖12个物理领域，通过元物理变换解决评估三难问题，要求AI代理通过交互式探索模拟复杂系统来发现隐藏原理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学发现基准存在评估三难问题（科学相关性、可扩展性和抗记忆性之间的权衡），且过度简化发现过程为静态函数拟合，未能捕捉真实科学探索过程。

Method: 使用元物理变换（对规范定律的系统性修改）生成大量问题，将评估从静态函数拟合提升为交互式模型发现，要求代理通过实验探索模拟复杂系统。

Result: 前沿LLM展现出清晰但脆弱的发现能力：随着系统复杂性增加而急剧下降，对观测噪声极度敏感。工具辅助存在悖论效应：提供代码解释器可能阻碍更有能力的模型，导致过早从探索转向利用。

Conclusion: 在复杂交互环境中实现稳健、可泛化的发现仍是核心挑战。NewtonBench为衡量真实进展和开发下一代真正科学发现AI代理提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于词典序偏好的多目标多智能体路径规划框架LCBS，直接计算符合用户偏好的解，避免构建Pareto前沿，可扩展到10个目标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MO-MAPF算法通常计算Pareto前沿而不优化用户偏好，且目标数增加时扩展性差

Method: LCBS算法结合优先级感知的A*搜索和基于冲突的搜索，直接根据词典序偏好进行规划

Result: LCBS能计算最优解，扩展到10个目标，在标准基准测试中成功率显著高于现有方法

Conclusion: 词典序框架为MO-MAPF提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，特别适合目标数较多的情况

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于生成式AI的工作流，让NFL媒体研究人员能够使用自然语言查询历史比赛片段，准确率超过95%，将查找视频的平均时间从10分钟缩短到30秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过滤点击界面效率低下，希望通过生成式AI实现自然语言查询来提升内容发现和管理效率。

Method: 采用代理工作流，将用户查询分解为元素并转换为底层数据库查询语言，通过精心设计的语义缓存提高准确性和延迟。

Result: 解决方案达到95%以上的准确率，将查找相关视频的平均时间从10分钟减少到30秒。

Conclusion: 该系统显著提高了NFL的运营效率，让用户能够专注于创作内容和引人入胜的故事线。

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and
management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we
demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and
analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than
traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user
query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the
underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved
through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95
percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10
minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational
efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and
engaging storylines.
