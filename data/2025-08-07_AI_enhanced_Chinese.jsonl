Existing methods typically leverage either global\nlow-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers\nfrom notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and\nmay disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often\nrequire extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)\nmodel that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker\ndecomposition.

A critical review of how NLP research approaches discrimination", "comment": null, "summary": "How to avoid discrimination in the context of NLP technology is one of the\nmajor challenges in the field. We propose that a different and more\nsubstantiated framing of the problem could help to find more productive\napproaches. In the first part of the paper we report on a case study: a\nqualitative review on papers published in the ACL anthologies 2022 on\ndiscriminatory behavior of NLP systems. We find that the field (i) still has a\nstrong focus on a technological fix of algorithmic discrimination, and (ii) is\nstruggling with a firm grounding of their ethical or normative vocabulary.\nFurthermore, this vocabulary is very limited, focusing mostly on the terms\n\"harm\" and \"bias\". In the second part of the paper we argue that addressing the\nlatter problems might help with the former. The understanding of algorithmic\ndiscrimination as a technological problem is reflected in and reproduced by the\nvocabulary in use. The notions of \"harm\" and \"bias\" implicate a narrow framing\nof the issue of discrimination as one of the system-user interface.

We propose a combined manifold and machine\nlearning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent\ncrowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions.

However, their growing openness and\ninteraction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial\nattacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as\ndedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this\nparadigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,\nand (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,\nsystem-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents\nfurther raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nEvo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that\nenables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than\nrelying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to\nsimultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,\nensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.\nFurthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing\nreinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial\ntraining paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS\nperformance under co-evolving threats.

To address these issues, we propose\nCX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\"\nreasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and\nverifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an\ninstruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148\nsamples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points\nsupervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under\nthe Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic\nreasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain\ndiagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the\nneed for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain\nMLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,\nachieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable\nCXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves\na mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best\nresults, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical\nutility across multiple dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCX-Mind\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\uff08CuRL-VPR\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0CXR\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u201c\u601d\u8003-\u56de\u7b54\u201d\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728CXR\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5197\u957f\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCX-Set\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08708,473\u56fe\u50cf\u548c2,619,148\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u621042,828\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ea4\u66ff\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff08Group Relative Policy Optimization\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u3002", "result": "CX-Mind\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534725.1%\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Rui-CXR\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "CX-Mind\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1CXR\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

This study proposes two innovative approaches to\nenhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion\nfactor-based method and a pixel-based method.

In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly\nestimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The\nexperimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.\nTests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show\nthat measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were\nreduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods.

This protocol is\nstraightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a\nparticular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that\nonline systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models\nreflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data.

In this paper we propose\na methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are\nretrained.

Existing studies show that incorporating search signals boosts\nrecommendation performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies\nheavily on rich search interactions. They primarily benefit a small subset of\nusers with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for\nthe majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the\nproblem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two\nkey challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse\nsearch interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under\nsparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich\nsearch interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.\nBased on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing\non the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced\nRecommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nvector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and\nthereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings\nof users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of\nusers with sparse interactions.

Contrastive learning is\nemployed to align latent reasoning states with target items, and reinforcement\nlearning is further introduced to directly optimize ranking performance.\nExtensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements\nover strong baselines, validating the importance of reasoning in enhancing\nsearch-aware recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6f5c\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u7f16\u7801\u7528\u6237\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u5386\u53f2\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u518d\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u641c\u7d22\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial\nconsistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,\nwe propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core\ngeographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into\nan iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed\ninto three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects\nrelevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that\nchooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in\nprevious rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative\nrefinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further\nrounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction\nquality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable\nrelationships.

In this paper, we propose a vector quantized\n(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image\ntransmission, named VQ-DeepISC.

Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission\ninstead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we\ndevelop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically\noptimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during\ntraining process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a\nuniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to\nstabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook\nupdates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase\nshift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard.

Empirical results show that, by explicitly modeling time,\nour models are very effective at capturing temporal signals, such as varying\nitem popularities over time.

Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal\nconcatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to\naccount for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons.

Tested on a privacy-preserving\ndataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit\nAuthority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our\nresults demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive\nvalue for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,\nindependent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable\nmore precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational\nresponses for platform crowding mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5229\u7528CCTV\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u7b97\u5730\u94c1\u7ad9\u53f0\u62e5\u6324\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u7b97\u5730\u94c1\u7ad9\u53f0\u62e5\u6324\u5ea6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u8425\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e58\u5ba2\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u95f4\u63a5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4eba\u7fa4\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff09\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b600\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u7b97\u62e5\u6324\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CCTV\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u72ec\u7acb\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u62e5\u6324\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u7ad9\u53f0\u62e5\u6324\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ca\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u54cd\u5e94\u3002"}}

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled\nIDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models.

While RAG\nmethods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation\nmodels, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge\nunderexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with\ngeneralization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and\nmodel-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID\ndynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach\nutilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with\ncategory-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further\nintegrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the\nquery, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID\ngenerates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images\nfrom a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched\ninput for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo).

However, this task\nis severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and\nhigh inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet).

Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

To validate our method, we construct the\nFine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging\nbenchmark for ITR in downstream data domains.

Our\nresults indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active\nlearning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster\n(in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new\nsamples to the training set using active learning does improve model\nperformance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the\nresults reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an\nimproved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the\nsampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of\ntransfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets\nand find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail\noff as more target points are selected for inclusion in training.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMeta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "MERA\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63a5\u7ba1\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO)\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMERA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MERA\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A particular challenge arises in\nscenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as\nthese parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since\nparked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information\nobtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately\nreflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.\nTo address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization\nframework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud\n(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image\nsegmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and\nsubsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise\nspatial inference.

Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture,\nFeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two\ncomplementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias\nElimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively\nevaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both\nrepresentation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54\nbaselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data\nvolume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under\ndecentralization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFeDaL\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9886\u57df\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFeDaL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Domain Bias Elimination (DBE)\u548cGlobal Bias Elimination (GBE)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c54\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFeDaL\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "FeDaL\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u6d88\u9664\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance\nFramework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency\nbranches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain\nlow-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially\nreduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but\nalso achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model\ncomplexity and computational overhead.

In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing\nattention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from\nmultiple views.

Although recent studies have explored\ngroup fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit\nregularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between\nsensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure.

Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective.

Five pre-trained models\nwere used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a\ncustom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation.

While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong\ngeneralization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging\nanalysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge\nthis gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction\ntechniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single\nmodality.

OCA\nintroduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from\nUSEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the\nincremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference\nof incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new\ninformation, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing\nthe capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in\na parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \\textbf{1.46M} learnable\nparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "NEARL-CLIP\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNEARL-CLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bUSEformer\uff08\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\uff09\u548cOCA\uff08\u6b63\u4ea4\u6280\u672f\u5206\u79bb\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u3002", "result": "NEARL-CLIP\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u53c2\u6570\uff081.46M\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "NEARL-CLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Besides, we propose a\ndetail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully\nintegrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature\noutput by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a\nlight-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally\nleverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic\nfeatures from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free\ncompetitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:\nPrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy\nattacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,\nwhich leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and\nprevent query-based inversion generalization.

CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought\nprompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and\nenhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each\nimage into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature\nrepresentation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot\nsamples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and\ntext encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by\nretrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad\ncompatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization\nand adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12\nFGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot\nCLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniFGVC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u56e0\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5c11\u6837\u672cCLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "UniFGVC\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it\nstruggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios.

To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA\nFusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with\nin-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,\nwhich dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains\nthrough learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task\nvector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the\norientation of the task vectors.

However, training samples easily contain\nprivate information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,\npotentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.\nAn intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content\nand retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant\ncomputational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning\nhas emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by\nselectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while\npreserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no\navailable datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection\nin biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark\nMultimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built\nupon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic\nprivate data and factual errors into the training set.

ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset\ndependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates\ngrounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object\nlocalization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then\nbuilds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning\naccuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning\npath to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought\n(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby\nreducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.\nFinally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates\nanswer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess\nwhether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably.

However,\ntraffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy\nconstraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for\ntraffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on\ndesigning communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information\nfrom other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information.

The results\nshow that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the\ndisclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of\nanother attribute?", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67905000\u591a\u4e2a\u8eab\u4efd\u76d7\u7a83\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4eba\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8eab\u4efd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fe\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u8fb9\u4ee3\u8868\u62ab\u9732\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u67d0\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

However,\nenabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major\nchallenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are\nparticularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal\ncontinual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal\nfeature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and\nzero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and\nsystematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by\nidentifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.\nBased on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to\ntheir target problems: (1) \\textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address\ncross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)\n\\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during\nupdates; and (3) \\textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter\ninterference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current\nevaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better\nbenchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional\ngeneralization.

However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations\nand the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the\nrelative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most\nexisting stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax\neffectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image\nstitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on\nthe novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry\ngrounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene\nreconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto\na designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving\npixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to\nfurther address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial\nstitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the\nrefined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large\nparallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric\nintegrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct\napplicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM.

Recent\nadvancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained\nVision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct\nFine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,\nremains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a\nperformance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex\nmitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is\nflawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further\ninvestigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting\nprimarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than\nfrom degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we\npropose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates\nstrategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned\nclassifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers.

Existing methods\ntypically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,\nrestricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative\nrepresentations.

Benefiting from the design of learnable\nqueries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the\nTSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned\nqueries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we\npropose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,\nleveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different\nqueries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,\nwe divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,\nmiddle, and long temporal durations, respectively.

Existing representations in robotics and\ncomputer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural\nregularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made\nenvironments. This paper introduces \\textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal\nrepresentation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly\naccommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to\ndecouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared\nvanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled\nnormal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding\nof structural regularities.

Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first\npredicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and\ntemporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware\nspatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse\nstructural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular\nvideo to generate final high-quality dense-view videos.

However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource\nconsumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and\ndeployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR\nmodel. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal\ncharacteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we\npropose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action\nsegmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder\nthat keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the\nembedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into\nnon-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion\nwords, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters.

Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the\nmodel to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are\nstreaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient\nto store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain\nlong-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG.

On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask\ndependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a\nphased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the\nDressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of\nour proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u670d\u88c5\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\uff08TWGTM\uff09\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\uff08VTON\uff09\u548c\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u8131\uff08VTOFF\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06VTON\u548cVTOFF\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTWGTM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u63a9\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728DressCode\u548cVITON-HD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TWGTM\u4e3a\u670d\u88c5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VTON\u548cVTOFF\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance\non exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability\nto handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality\nin real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments\nworn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically\nrestricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{OMFA} (\\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for\nboth virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition\ngarments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing\ngarments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target\nperson (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel\nposes-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built\nupon a novel \\emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise\nand denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,\nthe person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient\nbidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely\nmask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,\nmaking it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging\nSMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose\ntry-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA\nachieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a\npractical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis.

While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural\ngrounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,\ncompositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual\npatterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale\ndomain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational\nresources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Knowledge to Sight\n(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by\ndecomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as\nshape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from\ndomain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which\nguide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level\nsupervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial\nstructure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact\nmodels with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\\% of the data required by\nstate-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training\ndata, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical\nVLMs, with up to 9.82\\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$.

To address this limitation, we propose\nANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under\nsuch perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by\nfusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered\nto form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt\ntokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper\nlayers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware\nvisual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype\n(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,\nANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by\ncomputing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard\ncross-entropy and sim loss.

Experiments show that our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal\ninconsistency by 29%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-Occ\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e3D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5e27\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b3D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faST-Occ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473 mIoU\uff0c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u51cf\u5c1129%\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-Occ\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods\nsolely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the\ncomplementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to\ntackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally\nand simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.\nThese designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video\nmoment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or\nbackground sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,\nwe propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which\nlearns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts\nfor VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and\naudio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance\npredictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly\nassigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we\ndesign a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and\nvisual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their\ncomplementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation\nstrategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.\nTo evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,\nCharades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and\nre-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability\nin utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness\nof our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR\nmethods.
