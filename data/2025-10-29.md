### [1] [Explainable Detection of AI-Generated Images with Artifact Localization Using Faster-Than-Lies and Vision-Language Models for Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23775)
*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的图像真实性检测系统，结合轻量级卷积分类器和视觉语言模型，在32x32低分辨率图像上实现96.5%的准确率，并能定位和解释视觉伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的日益真实化给视觉真实性验证带来挑战，需要开发能够解释检测结果的系统。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积分类器"Faster-Than-Lies"与视觉语言模型Qwen2-VL-7B结合，通过自编码器重构误差图生成伪影定位热图，并将70种视觉伪影分为8个语义组。

Result: 在扩展的CiFAKE数据集上达到96.5%准确率，在8核CPU上推理时间为175ms，能够生成可解释的文本描述检测到的异常。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了结合视觉和语言推理进行可解释真实性检测的可行性，在取证、工业检测和社交媒体审核等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [2] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer是一个基于Transformer的类无关物体计数框架，通过识别视觉重复和结构关系来实现计数，无需依赖物体类别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够通过感知视觉重复和结构关系来轻松计数各种物体，而不依赖类别身份。但现有计数模型在物体形状复杂、具有内部对称性或重叠组件时经常计数错误。

Method: 基于CounTR架构，用自监督基础模型DINOv2替换视觉编码器以获得更丰富和空间一致的特征表示，并加入位置嵌入融合来保持几何关系，最后通过轻量卷积解码器将特征解码为密度图。

Result: 在FSC-147数据集上，模型性能与当前最先进方法相当，在结构复杂或密集场景中表现出更优越的准确性。

Conclusion: 集成DINOv2等基础模型使计数系统能够接近人类的结构感知能力，朝着真正通用且无需示例的计数范式迈进。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [3] [A geometric and deep learning reproducible pipeline for monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in urban rivers using in situ cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23798)
*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于固定原位摄像头和深度学习的新方法，用于河流漂浮垃圾的连续监测和量化，并评估不同模型在复杂环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 河流中漂浮的人为垃圾对生物多样性、水质和人类活动造成负面影响，需要有效的监测方法。

Method: 使用固定原位摄像头采集数据，应用深度学习模型进行垃圾检测和量化，结合几何模型从2D图像估计物体实际尺寸，并测试不同环境条件和学习配置。

Result: 研究发现数据集构建协议（特别是负样本整合和时间泄漏考虑）对模型性能至关重要，证明了结合投影几何和回归修正的度量物体估计可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发低成本、自动化的城市水环境监测系统提供了可行途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

### [4] [RareFlow: Physics-Aware Flow-Matching for Cross-Sensor Super-Resolution of Rare-Earth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23816)
*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow是一个用于遥感图像超分辨率的物理感知框架，专门针对分布外(OOD)条件下的鲁棒性设计，通过双条件架构和不确定性量化来避免特征幻觉，在专家评估中接近真实图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像超分辨率在分布外条件下经常失败，产生视觉上合理但物理上不准确的结果，特别是在罕见地貌特征和多样化传感器场景中。

Method: 采用双条件架构：门控ControlNet保持低分辨率输入的几何保真度，文本提示提供复杂特征的语义指导；引入多面损失函数确保光谱和辐射一致性；使用随机前向传播方法量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在地球物理专家盲评中，模型输出接近真实图像保真度，显著优于最先进基线；感知指标定量提升，FID降低近40%。

Conclusion: RareFlow为数据稀缺科学领域提供了高保真合成的鲁棒框架，并为严重域偏移下的受控生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [5] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的3D场景生成方法，通过将通用文本到3D对象扩散模型重新用作模块化瓦片生成器，实现大规模连贯场景的合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常局限于单对象生成、需要领域特定训练或缺乏完整360度视角支持，需要一种更通用的3D场景生成解决方案。

Method: 将场景生成重新表述为多瓦片去噪问题，独立生成重叠的3D区域并通过加权平均无缝融合，保留局部语义控制。

Result: 该方法支持多样化的场景布局、高效生成和灵活编辑，无需场景级数据集或重新训练。

Conclusion: 建立了一个简单而强大的基础，用于通用语言驱动的3D场景构建，继承了对象级先验的泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [6] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP是一个无需训练的框架，通过分析CLIP模型在层、头和token三个层面的视觉区分能力，提出了三种互补技术来提升语义分割性能，在8个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CLIP模型的图像级预训练目标与密集预测所需的像素级视觉理解存在不对齐，现有方法继承了前面层的全局对齐偏差，导致分割性能不理想。

Method: 提出了三种技术：语义-空间重加权、选择性头部增强和异常token替换，这些方法基于对CLIP模型在层、头和token层面视觉区分能力的深入分析。

Result: 在8个常见语义分割基准测试中，LHT-CLIP实现了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性和实际部署的实用性。

Conclusion: LHT-CLIP通过系统利用CLIP模型在不同层面的视觉区分能力，无需额外训练即可有效恢复视觉区分能力并显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [7] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride是一个无需手动场景分割的管道，通过自适应帧采样和多模态窗口技术生成连贯的场景级视频字幕，在YouCookII数据集上优于VLLaMA3和GPT-4o等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教学视频中的场景级字幕需要理解视觉线索和时间结构，但现有字幕缺乏这种结构会导致不连贯和低质量，影响教育效果。

Method: 使用自适应帧采样和多模态窗口捕捉关键过渡，采用多模态思维链生成多个动作-对象对，通过动态步长窗口选择算法平衡时间上下文和冗余，最终生成融合视觉语义和时间推理的指令性字幕。

Result: 在N-gram指标（BLEU、METEOR）和语义相似度指标（BERTScore、CLIPScore）上均优于基线模型，定性分析显示生成的字幕在时间连贯性和信息量方面更优。

Conclusion: DynaStride为改进AI驱动的教学内容生成提供了一个有前景的方向，能够产生更连贯和信息丰富的场景级字幕。

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

### [8] [TurboPortrait3D: Single-step diffusion-based fast portrait novel-view synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23929)
*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D：一种低延迟的人像新视角合成方法，通过结合图像到3D模型和扩散模型，在保持3D感知的同时显著提升质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人像图像到3D模型存在视觉伪影、细节缺失和身份保持不足的问题，而图像扩散模型虽然质量高但缺乏3D一致性且计算昂贵。

Method: 采用前馈图像到化身生成管道获取初始3D表示和噪声渲染，然后通过单步扩散模型进行多视角一致的细化，结合合成多视图数据预训练和高质量真实图像微调。

Result: 在质量和数量上均优于当前最先进的人像新视角合成方法，同时保持时间效率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功证明了图像空间扩散模型可以显著提升图像到化身方法的生成质量，同时保持3D感知和低延迟运行。

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

### [9] [PlanarGS: High-Fidelity Indoor 3D Gaussian Splatting Guided by Vision-Language Planar Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23930)
*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的室内场景重建框架，通过语言提示平面先验和几何监督来改善低纹理区域的3D表面重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在室内场景中，大面积的低纹理区域会导致3D高斯泼溅的光度损失产生模糊的几何形状，无法恢复高保真度的3D表面。

Method: 设计了语言提示平面先验(LP3)管道，使用预训练的视觉语言分割模型，并通过交叉视图融合和几何先验检查来优化区域建议。在3D高斯优化中增加了平面先验监督项和几何先验监督项。

Result: 在标准室内基准测试中，PlanarGS重建了准确且详细的3D表面，大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PlanarGS通过引入平面和几何先验监督，有效解决了室内场景中3D高斯泼溅的几何模糊问题，实现了高质量的3D表面重建。

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

### [10] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe是一种自适应训练方案，通过神经元剪枝和输入频率密集化来优化隐式神经表示，在减小模型规模的同时保持甚至提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示方法在选择输入频率和架构时存在挑战，通常需要启发式方法和繁重的超参数优化，参数冗余问题也未得到有效解决。

Method: 采用神经元剪枝机制避免冗余，通过目标权重衰减将信息转移到剩余神经元，然后进行结构化剪枝；同时通过输入频率密集化在信号欠拟合的频谱区域添加频率，扩展表示基础。

Result: 在图像和SDF上的实验表明，AIRe能够减小模型规模，同时保持甚至改善重建质量。

Conclusion: AIRe提供了一种改进的网络大小与重建质量之间的权衡方案，代码和预训练模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Neural USD框架，通过结构化层次化表示场景和对象，实现精确的迭代式对象编辑控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前可控生成模型中精确迭代对象编辑的挑战，避免改变条件信号时导致的意外全局变化

Method: 借鉴计算机图形学中的USD标准，采用结构化层次化表示场景和对象，应用微调方法确保控制信号解耦

Result: 评估了框架的多个设计考虑，展示了Neural USD如何支持迭代和增量工作流程

Conclusion: Neural USD框架为精确的对象编辑提供了有效解决方案，支持外观、几何和姿态的逐对象控制

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

*Peiyang Xu,Minzhou Pan,Zhaorun Chen,Shuang Yang,Chaowei Xiao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision是一个创新的图像护栏系统，通过整合类人推理来增强适应性和透明度，无需重新训练即可动态适应不断发展的安全策略，在多个基准测试中表现优于GPT-4o且速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像护栏模型受限于预定义类别，缺乏语义推理能力，容易误分类内容，且难以适应新兴威胁，需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 采用有效的数据收集和生成框架、策略遵循训练流程、定制损失函数，以及多样化的QA生成和训练策略来增强学习效果。

Result: SafeVision在VisionHarm-T上比GPT-4o提升8.6%，在VisionHarm-C上提升15.5%，速度超过16倍，并引入了高质量的VisionHarm数据集。

Conclusion: SafeVision建立了一个全面、策略遵循且可解释的图像护栏系统，能够动态适应新兴威胁。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一个将链式思维推理引入胸部X光解读的框架，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）生成可验证的推理轨迹，提高临床可审计性和人机协作安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中缺乏透明推理过程，无法提供临床医生依赖的逐步推理，限制了临床应用的可信度。

Method: 结合高保真视觉编码和两阶段训练：首先进行推理风格的监督微调，然后使用基于X光异常验证的奖励进行强化学习。

Result: 在分布外评估中实现竞争性多标签分类，同时提高可解释性；专家放射科医生研究表明完整推理轨迹提高了信心，支持错误审计并减少报告完成时间。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持准确性的同时显著提高了推理质量，支持向可信赖、可解释的医学AI发展，特别是在推理质量与预测质量同等重要的医学成像任务中。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

Motivation: 现有方法使用循环神经网络逐个预测傅里叶分量，导致性能下降和效率低下，需要改进任意尺度超分辨率中的成本-质量可控性。

Method: 通过联合预测多个傅里叶分量，而不是逐个独立预测，来提高超分辨率的效率和质量。

Result: 该方法在质量和效率方面都有所提升，解决了现有独立预测方法的问题。

Conclusion: 联合预测多个傅里叶分量是改进任意尺度超分辨率成本-质量可控性的有效方法。

Abstract: Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is
crucial. Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using a
recurrent neural network. However, this approach leads to performance
degradation and inefficiency due to independent prediction. This paper proposes
predicting multiple components jointly to improve both quality and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估AI助手能力，缺乏真实流式场景，或仅支持短期任务，无法满足现实世界自我中心AI助手需要处理多模态输入、实时响应并保留长期记忆的需求。

Method: 构建包含工作学习、生活方式、社交活动和外出文化四个领域的同步多模态数据集，数据在统一时间线上对齐，包含高质量视觉叙述和语音转录，通过人工精炼。定义12个子任务评估记忆、理解和跨记忆推理三大核心能力。

Conclusion: TeleEgo为开发实用AI助手提供了现实且全面的评估框架，能够推动自我中心AI助手在实际应用中的发展。

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its
development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized
post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This
initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a

Motivation: 火星科学缺乏标准化基准和评估框架，限制了火星基础模型的发展，而其他领域通过标准化基准取得了快速进展。

Method: 构建包含20个数据集的Mars-Bench基准，使用在自然图像、地球卫星数据和最先进视觉语言模型上预训练的模型进行基线评估。

Result: 所有分析结果表明，火星特定基础模型可能比通用领域模型更具优势，激励进一步探索领域自适应预训练。

Conclusion: Mars-Bench旨在为火星科学机器学习模型的开发和比较建立标准化基础，推动火星基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

Conclusion: APT框架能够有效评估文本到图像模型的安全漏洞，生成人类可读的对抗性提示，并成功绕过商业API的安全机制，揭示了关键的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有稀疏微调方法的两阶段范式问题：基于梯度定位任务相关权重时忽略微调过程中的参数调整，且稀疏掩码梯度更新导致高内存使用。

Method: 提出单阶段方法SNELLA：1) 通过两个低秩可学习矩阵合并的稀疏矩阵选择性更新权重矩阵，引入非线性核函数增加合并矩阵的秩；2) 自适应双层稀疏分配机制，基于重要性分数端到端地在层间和层内进行权重竞争。

Result: 在分类、分割和生成任务上，SNELLA以低内存使用实现SOTA性能：在FGVC基准上比SPT-LoRA提高1.8% Top-1准确率（91.9% vs 90.1%），在86M到632M参数规模的模型上内存减少31.1%-39.9%。

Conclusion: SNELLA通过单阶段设计和创新的稀疏分配机制，在参数高效微调中实现了性能提升和内存优化的双重目标。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are
available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/SNELL.

TL;DR: 提出COLA框架，通过最优传输理论解决CLIP模型在对抗攻击下的跨模态特征对齐问题，无需训练即可显著提升对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注对抗微调或提示优化，但忽视了CLIP编码特征中的文本和图像特征距离过远的问题，这种不对齐在对抗扰动下会被显著放大，导致分类性能严重下降

Method: 1) 将对抗图像嵌入投影到类文本特征张成的子空间，过滤非语义失真；2) 将图像和文本建模为多个增强视图上的离散分布，通过最优传输优化对齐，并将子空间投影无缝集成到成本计算中

Result: 在14个零样本分类基准上的广泛评估显示COLA的有效性，在PGD对抗攻击下ImageNet及其变体平均提升6.7%，同时在干净样本上保持高准确率

Conclusion: COLA是一个无需训练且与现有微调模型兼容的框架，通过恢复全局图像-文本对齐和局部结构一致性，有效解决了对抗环境下的跨模态对齐问题

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型用于生成合成训练数据时，使用少量真实样本微调可以提高数据质量，但会导致过拟合和多样性降低，特别是在细粒度分类任务中。

Method: 首先提取类无关属性（如场景背景和物体姿态），在微调T2I模型时显式条件化这些属性，在生成时边缘化它们，以减少过拟合并保持生成先验。

Result: 在多个T2I模型、骨干网络和数据集上的实验表明，BOB在低样本细粒度分类中达到SOTA性能，在Aircraft数据集上比DataDream提升7.4%，在18/24个实验设置中优于先前方法。

Conclusion: BOB方法有效缓解了T2I模型微调时的过拟合问题，保持了生成多样性，显著提升了合成数据在低样本细粒度分类任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

Motivation: 预训练视觉模型在广泛应用中对表示可解释性提出了新要求，但尚不清楚预训练表示是否能同时实现高可解释性和高分类能力。

Method: 提出固有可解释性评分(IIS)，通过评估解释过程中的信息损失来量化表示可解释性，测量可解释语义在表示中的比例。

Result: 发现可解释性与分类能力呈正相关：分类能力更高的表示提供更多可被解释捕获的可解释语义。通过可解释性最大化微调可进一步提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 实践者可以在预训练视觉模型中统一提升可解释性和分类能力，基于解释的预测具有更小的准确率下降。

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes
are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/IIS.

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K数据集上分别取得5.59%和0.83%的性能提升，优于现有方法

Conclusion: UHKD是统一异构表示并有效利用视觉知识的有效方法

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K

Abstract: We present DogMo, a large-scale multi-view RGB-D video dataset capturing
diverse canine movements for the task of motion recovery from images. DogMo
comprises 1.2k motion sequences collected from 10 unique dogs, offering rich
variation in both motion and breed. It addresses key limitations of existing
dog motion datasets, including the lack of multi-view and real 3D data, as well
as limited scale and diversity. Leveraging DogMo, we establish four motion
recovery benchmark settings that support systematic evaluation across monocular
and multi-view, RGB and RGB-D inputs. To facilitate accurate motion recovery,
we further introduce a three-stage, instance-specific optimization pipeline
that fits the SMAL model to the motion sequences. Our method progressively
refines body shape and pose through coarse alignment, dense correspondence
supervision, and temporal regularization. Our dataset and method provide a
principled foundation for advancing research in dog motion recovery and open up
new directions at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and
animal behavior modeling.

*Jiajian Xie,Hubery Yin,Chen Li,Zhou Zhao,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ETC框架，通过趋势一致性预测和误差容忍度搜索机制，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速扩散模型采样过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但受限于昂贵的迭代采样成本。现有的训练免费加速方法忽略了去噪趋势，缺乏对模型特定容忍度的误差控制，导致轨迹偏差和结果不一致。

Method: 1) 引入一致性趋势预测器，利用扩散轨迹的平滑连续性，将历史去噪模式投影到稳定的未来方向，并在多个近似步骤中渐进分布；2) 提出模型特定误差容忍度搜索机制，通过识别从波动语义规划到稳定质量精炼的过渡点来推导修正阈值。

Result: 实验显示ETC在FLUX基础上实现了2.65倍加速，同时一致性退化可忽略（-0.074 SSIM分数）。

Conclusion: ETC框架有效解决了扩散模型加速中的轨迹偏差问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了采样效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Motivation: 现代文本到图像模型在组合性方面仍有不足，经常无法准确渲染对象数量、属性和空间关系。

Method: 利用大型语言模型从输入提示中合成显式布局，并将这些布局注入图像生成过程，通过对象中心视觉语言模型对多个候选结果进行重排序，迭代选择最符合提示的结果。

Result: 通过统一显式布局基础和基于自精炼的推理时扩展，该框架在场景与提示对齐方面优于最近的文本到图像模型。

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架有效提升了文本到图像生成的组合性和布局忠实度。

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role
of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing
coherent and instruction-aligned videos. However, strategies for optimizing
video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this

decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured
prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on
safety-critical autonomous driving tasks. Code and prompt are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个针对SAM2的跨提示通用对抗攻击UAP-SAM2，通过双语义偏差框架解决SAM2架构差异带来的挑战，在多个数据集上显著优于现有攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2作为SAM的继任者在视频分割中表现出强大的泛化能力，但其鲁棒性尚未被探索，且现有针对SAM的攻击是否能直接迁移到SAM2尚不清楚。

Method: 设计目标扫描策略将每帧分为k个区域并随机分配提示以减少提示依赖性，同时构建双语义偏差框架，通过扭曲当前帧语义和破坏跨帧语义一致性来优化UAP。

Result: 在六个数据集的两个分割任务上的实验表明，UAP-SAM2显著优于最先进的攻击方法，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2成功解决了SAM2架构差异带来的挑战，为SAM2的对抗鲁棒性研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical
structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing
efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical
diagnostic scenarios. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-SJD是一种无需训练、无损的并行解码框架，通过扩展Speculative Jacobi Decoding来加速自回归视觉生成，解决了标准SJD中token不稳定性导致的接受率下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视觉生成模型由于逐token生成的推理速度过慢，严重限制了实际应用。标准SJD虽然具有加速潜力，但独立采样过程导致的token不稳定性显著降低了接受率。

Method: 基于信息论中的耦合方法，MC-SJD通过最大化连续迭代中采样相同草稿token的概率来加速标准SJD，同时保持无损特性，仅需对现有算法进行单行修改。

Result: 该方法在图像生成中实现了约4.2倍加速，在视频生成中实现了约13.3倍加速，且输出质量没有任何下降。

Conclusion: MC-SJD提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，显著提升了自回归视觉生成的推理效率，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Result: ID²Face在视觉质量、身份抑制和效用保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的训练中心框架有效解决了身份匿名化问题，实现了更好的解耦和控制。

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

Conclusion: SCOPE方法通过联合考虑显著性和覆盖度，有效解决了视觉token修剪中的语义不完整问题，提高了多模态大语言模型的效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The
dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at

Conclusion: LROD框架有效解决了恢复与检测网络之间的功能不匹配问题，为恶劣条件下的目标检测提供了更稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

Conclusion: 通过将序列建模与阴影去除的结构完整性和色彩一致性要求相结合，提出的方法在阴影去除任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

Motivation: 合成图像来源归因在数据稀缺条件下具有挑战性，需要少样本或零样本分类能力。现有方法在样本有限时性能不足。

Method: 训练免费的one-shot归因方法：生成图像描述，用所有候选模型重合成图像，在特征空间中比较与原图的相似度。

Result: 提出的重合成方法在只有少量训练样本时优于现有技术。新数据集为开发归因模型提供了具有挑战性的基准。

Conclusion: 基于重合成的方法在少样本条件下表现优异，新数据集对开发少样本和零样本方法具有重要价值。

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

TL;DR: 提出了ViPER框架，通过两阶段任务和自举机制解决视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉感知方面的瓶颈，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉感知方面存在能力限制，这是实际应用中的关键瓶颈。现有方法如监督微调会损害通用能力，而强化微调则偏向文本推理而非视觉感知。

Method: 提出两阶段任务，将视觉感知学习构建为从粗到细的渐进过程。开发ViPER自举框架，通过自我批判和自我预测实现迭代进化，整合图像级和实例级重建与两阶段强化学习策略，建立闭环训练范式。

Result: 应用于Qwen2.5-VL系列，产生Qwen-Viper系列，在7个综合基准测试中平均提升1.7%，在细粒度感知任务上提升高达6.0%，在各种视觉语言场景中表现优异且保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViPER不仅实现了感知能力的自我提升，还为生成与理解之间的互惠关系提供了具体证据，是开发更自主、更强大视觉语言模型的重要突破。

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Motivation: 遥感应用中深度学习性能受限于标注数据稀缺和跨域标注成本高，而现有视觉语言模型如CLIP在遥感领域存在显著领域差距和任务特定语义适应需求。

Method: 评估了四种代表性提示学习方法：上下文优化、条件上下文优化、多模态提示学习以及带自调节约束的提示学习，反映了从静态优化到条件提示、多模态适应和语义正则化的互补设计理念。

Result: 在多个遥感基准数据集上的实验表明，提示学习方法在少样本场景下始终优于零样本CLIP和线性探针基线，其中带自调节约束的提示学习实现了最稳健的跨域性能。

Conclusion: 提示学习为卫星和航空影像中的领域差距提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，为该领域未来研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance

strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher

switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image

TL;DR: W2-Net通过双查询机制解决指代表达式计数问题，将问题解耦为"计数什么"和"在哪里看"，显著提升了子类级别的对象计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的指代表达式计数方法存在根本性挑战：标注点通常放在类别代表性位置（如头部），迫使模型关注类别级特征而忽略其他视觉区域（如腿部）的属性信息。

Method: 提出W2-Net框架，采用双查询机制：标准的"计数什么"查询用于定位对象，专门的"在哪里看"查询用于从属性特定视觉区域提取特征。同时引入子类可分离匹配策略，通过排斥力增强子类间可分性。

Result: 在REC-8K数据集上显著优于现有最优方法，计数误差降低22.5%（验证集）和18.0%（测试集），定位F1分数分别提升7%和8%。

Conclusion: W2-Net通过明确解耦"计数什么"和"在哪里看"，有效解决了指代表达式计数中的属性信息利用问题，为细粒度子类计数提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

TL;DR: StrokeSeg是一个轻量级、模块化的框架，可将研究级脑卒中病灶分割模型转化为可部署的临床应用工具，通过解耦预处理、推理和后处理流程，并使用ONNX Runtime和Float16量化来减小模型大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习框架（如nnU-Net）在脑卒中病灶分割方面性能优异，但由于依赖复杂和整体化设计，难以在临床环境中部署使用。

Method: 将预处理、推理和后处理解耦：预处理使用Anima工具箱生成BIDS兼容输出，推理使用ONNX Runtime和Float16量化（模型大小减少约50%），提供图形界面和命令行界面，支持Python脚本和独立的Windows可执行文件。

Result: 在300名亚急性和慢性脑卒中患者的测试集上，分割性能与原始PyTorch流水线相当（Dice差异<10^-3）。

Conclusion: 高性能研究流水线可以转化为便携、临床可用的工具，为脑卒中病灶分割的临床部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种亮度感知多尺度网络(MLSN)用于偏振图像融合，通过亮度分支动态加权注入亮度信息，解决了偏振图像固有对比度差异问题，并在复杂光照环境下显著提升了融合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏振图像融合结合S0和DOLP图像，通过互补的纹理特征揭示表面粗糙度和材料特性，在伪装识别、组织病理分析、表面缺陷检测等领域有重要应用。需要解决复杂亮度环境下不同偏振图像的互补信息整合问题。

Method: 提出MLSN网络：编码器阶段通过亮度分支生成多尺度空间权重矩阵，动态加权注入亮度信息；瓶颈层设计全局-局部特征融合机制，通过窗口自注意力计算平衡全局上下文和局部细节；解码器阶段提出亮度增强模块，建立亮度分布与纹理特征的映射关系，实现融合结果的非线性亮度校正。

Result: 在MSP、PIF和GAND数据集上的广泛实验验证，MLSN在主观和客观评估中均优于最先进方法，MS-SSIM和SD指标分别比其他方法的平均值高出8.57%、60.64%、10.26%、63.53%、22.21%和54.31%。

Conclusion: MLSN网络有效解决了偏振图像融合中的亮度适应性问题，提出的MSP数据集填补了高质量偏振图像融合数据集的空白，为相关应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了放射学报告在医学图像分类中的使用时机和方式，发现报告在预训练和微调阶段的使用效果取决于标签与文本的关联程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像通常配有包含丰富专家注释的放射学报告，但依赖这些报告需要放射科医生的及时手动工作。因此需要研究何时以及如何利用放射学报告来改进仅基于图像的分类。

Method: 系统研究放射学报告在预训练和微调阶段的使用，涵盖诊断和预后任务，并在不同训练集规模下进行实验。

Result: 1) 当标签在文本中充分体现时，预训练阶段利用报告有益；但通过显式图像-文本对齐的预训练在不满足条件时可能有害。2) 使用报告进行微调可带来显著改进，在某些情况下影响甚至大于预训练方法。

Conclusion: 研究为利用特权文本数据训练医学图像分类器提供了可操作的见解，同时指出了当前研究中的空白。

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

TL;DR: REFLECT是一种基于流的生成模型，用于无监督检测中风后患者的局灶性和非病灶性异常。在ATLAS数据上评估，使用健康对照组数据训练的模型比使用无病灶中风患者数据训练的模型表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风后MRI不仅显示局灶性病变，还揭示继发性结构变化（如萎缩和脑室扩大），这些异常作为恢复和预后的影像生物标志物，但监督分割方法难以有效捕捉。

Method: 使用REFLECT（基于流的生成模型）进行无监督异常检测，在ATLAS数据上使用双专家中心切片标注，通过Free-Response ROC分析评估异常图的对象级性能。训练了两个模型：一个使用中风患者无病灶切片（ATLAS），另一个使用健康对照组（IXI）。

Result: 在ATLAS测试对象上，IXI训练的模型实现了更高的病灶分割（Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27）和对非病灶异常更高的敏感性（FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43）。

Conclusion: 在完全健康解剖结构上训练可以改善对正常变异性的建模，从而实现更广泛和更可靠的结构异常检测。

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于卫星影像和机器学习的传感器无关方法，用于实时监测黎巴嫩Qaraaoun水库的蓄水量，通过新型水体分割指数和SVR模型实现高精度体积估算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Qaraaoun水库作为黎巴嫩最大的地表水体，由于传感器频繁故障和维护能力有限，需要一种可靠的无传感器监测方法来实现可持续管理。

Method: 整合开源卫星影像（Sentinel-2和Landsat），使用新型水体分割指数进行水面提取，并基于支持向量回归（SVR）建立水面面积与水库体积的机器学习模型。

Result: 水体分割精度超过95%，SVR模型误差低于水库总容量的1.5%，决定系数超过0.98，证明了方法的鲁棒性和成本效益。

Conclusion: 该方法为水库存储的连续、传感器独立监测提供了实用解决方案，可复制用于其他水体，生成的50年时间序列数据对气候变化和环境模式研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the

*Reem Hammoud,Abdul karim Gizzini,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门用于评估语义分割中可解释AI方法的系统框架，考虑了空间和上下文任务的复杂性，使用像素级评估策略和精心设计的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在安全关键领域的应用增加，确保模型透明度和可信度至关重要。虽然分类任务中的XAI评估已有进展，但语义分割的评估策略相对缺乏。

Method: 开发了针对语义分割的XAI评估框架，采用像素级评估策略和专门设计的指标，使用基于类激活映射(CAM)的XAI方案进行模拟验证。

Result: 模拟结果表明所提方法具有高效性、鲁棒性和可靠性，能够提供细粒度的可解释性洞察。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推进透明、可信和可问责的语义分割模型发展。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

*Zhineng Zhao,Zhihai He,Zikun Zhou,Siwei Ma,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于功能分解的深度条件图像压缩框架（DCIC-sgp），通过自生成先验来分离图像的结构骨架和细节纹理，有效解决了传统方法在低码率下的几何变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习图像压缩方法难以同时建模自然图像中复杂的相关结构，特别是全局不变结构与局部瞬态纹理的纠缠问题，导致在低码率下出现严重的几何变形。

Method: 使用功能分解框架，首先编码一个自生成先验来捕捉图像的结构骨架，然后用这个先验来整体调制整个压缩流程，特别是分析变换，使其专注于剩余的高熵细节。

Result: 在Kodak、CLIC和Tecnick数据集上，相比VVC测试模型VTM-12.1分别实现了14.4%、15.7%和15.1%的BD-rate降低，显著缓解了低码率下的几何变形伪影。

Conclusion: 通过层次化、依赖驱动的方法实现了信息流的有效解耦，在保持高压缩性能的同时显著改善了视觉质量。

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视频扩散模型在视觉任务中比语言模型表现出更高的数据效率，表明视频预训练为视觉基础模型提供了有益的归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言领域取得了成功，但在视觉领域仍面临组合理解、样本效率和通用问题解决等挑战，需要探索新的预训练方法。

Method: 使用预训练的视频扩散模型和语言模型，配备轻量级适配器，在自然模态下进行任务评估，包括ARC-AGI、ConceptARC、视觉游戏、路径规划和元胞自动机等基准测试。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，视频扩散模型比语言模型表现出更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: 视频预训练提供了支持视觉基础模型发展的归纳偏置，是通往视觉智能的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kineo是一个无需标定的多视角无标记运动捕捉系统，使用消费级RGB相机，能够同时进行相机标定和3D关键点重建，在精度和效率上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无标定运动捕捉方法需要精确的相机标定，限制了非专家用户的使用和在野外环境中的应用。现有免标定方法存在计算成本高和重建精度低的问题。

Method: 利用现成的2D关键点检测器，通过置信度驱动的时空关键点采样策略和图优化方法，同时进行相机标定（包括畸变系数）和3D关键点重建，并引入成对重投影一致性评分来量化重建可靠性。

Result: 在EgoHumans和Human3.6M数据集上的评估显示，相比现有方法，相机平移误差降低83-85%，相机角度误差降低86-92%，世界平均每关节误差降低83-91%。处理效率高，能在特定配置下比视频时长更快地处理多视角序列。

Conclusion: Kineo提供了一个完全自动化的免标定运动捕捉解决方案，在精度、效率和实用性方面都有显著提升，为实际应用提供了可行的工具。

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

*Kyungmin Lee,Sihyun Yu,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Decoupled MeanFlow方法，将流模型转换为流映射模型，无需架构修改即可实现1-4步高质量生成，在ImageNet上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去噪生成模型（如扩散模型和流模型）需要大量去噪步骤，而流映射方法虽然能加速采样但通常需要架构修改，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 提出解耦均值流方法，通过条件化扩散变换器的最后模块到后续时间步，将预训练流模型直接转换为流映射模型，结合增强训练技术。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x256上，1步生成分别达到FID 2.16和2.12，4步生成分别达到FID 1.51和1.68，比现有方法有显著提升，推理速度提升100倍以上。

Conclusion: 训练流模型后转换为流映射模型比从头训练更高效有效，该方法实现了高质量快速生成，几乎匹配流模型性能但推理速度大幅提升。

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DisK-NeuralRTI方法，通过知识蒸馏降低NeuralRTI的计算成本，使其能在有限硬件上实现全分辨率交互重光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RTI方法（如PTM和HSH）使用固定基函数和少量像素系数，难以准确捕捉复杂反射场，在强反射或阴影区域易产生伪影。NeuralRTI虽能产生更高质量结果，但解码网络参数多，计算成本高，无法在有限硬件上实现全分辨率渲染。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏（Knowledge Distillation）技术，训练一个轻量级学生网络来模仿大型教师网络（NeuralRTI）的行为，从而降低计算复杂度。

Result: DisK-NeuralRTI在保持NeuralRTI高质量的同时，显著降低了计算成本，使其能够在有限硬件上实现全分辨率交互重光照。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是降低NeuralRTI计算成本的有效方法，能够在保持高质量的同时实现实时交互重光照。

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

TL;DR: Latent Sketchpad是一个为多模态大语言模型添加内部视觉草稿本框架，通过视觉潜在表示支持生成式视觉思维，提升复杂场景中的视觉规划和想象能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在需要视觉规划和想象的复杂场景中表现不佳，受人类使用草图进行视觉思考的启发，希望为模型提供类似的视觉思维工具。

Method: 引入Context-Aware Vision Head自回归生成视觉表示，配合预训练的Sketch Decoder将其渲染为可解释的草图图像，将视觉生成直接集成到模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在MazePlanning数据集上的实验表明，Latent Sketchpad在保持或超越骨干模型推理性能的同时，能够跨不同前沿MLLMs（如Gemma3和Qwen2.5-VL）泛化。

Conclusion: 该框架通过扩展模型的文本推理到视觉思维，为人机交互和更广泛应用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSWorld-MCP是首个全面公平的基准测试，用于评估计算机使用代理在真实环境中的工具调用、GUI操作和决策能力，包含158个高质量工具，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去评估主要关注GUI交互技能，而工具调用能力被忽视，导致集成工具调用的代理与仅评估GUI交互的代理之间比较不公平。

Method: 设计了自动代码生成流水线创建工具，结合现有工具精选，经过严格人工验证得到158个高质量工具，覆盖7个常见应用。

Result: 评估显示MCP工具普遍提高任务成功率（如OpenAI o3从8.3%提升到20.4%，Claude 4 Sonnet从40.1%提升到43.3%），但最强模型的工具调用率仍较低（仅36.3%）。

Conclusion: OSWorld-MCP通过明确测量MCP工具使用技能，深化了对多模态代理的理解，为复杂工具辅助环境中的性能评估设定了新标准。

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents
and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted
environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习的散射伪影校正方法，利用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并嵌入Kolmogorov-Arnold网络层，结合物理先验知识来有效校正CBCT图像中的散射伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锥束CT在数据采集过程中容易受到散射影响，导致重建图像出现CT值偏差和组织对比度降低，从而降低诊断准确性。

Method: 利用散射概率密度分布在投影域具有旋转对称性的物理特性，使用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并将其嵌入KAN网络层，结合物理特性和复杂函数映射能力来学习高维散射特征。

Result: 通过合成和真实扫描实验验证，该方法能有效校正重建图像中的散射伪影，在定量指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于物理先验知识和KAN网络的深度学习方法能够准确表示散射，有效提升CBCT图像质量。

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法在人脸伪造检测方面具有有效性，为保护AI生态系统免受视觉伪造攻击做出了潜在贡献。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

Motivation: 病理学家对千兆像素全切片图像（WSIs）的诊断准确性平均约为70%，增加第二位病理学家并不能显著提高决策一致性。该领域缺乏足够的行为数据来解释诊断错误和不一致性。

Method: 通过一个名为PTAH的应用基础测试平台，收集了19位病理学家解读397张WSIs的18.69小时数据，包括眼动追踪、鼠标交互、刺激追踪、视口导航和诊断决策数据（EMSVD）。

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to
average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve
decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain
diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present
PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual
search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during
cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Group Relative Attention Guidance（GRAG）的新方法，通过重新加权DiT模型中不同token的delta值，实现对图像编辑强度的连续精细控制，无需额外调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Diffusion-in-Transformer模型的图像编辑方法缺乏对编辑程度的有效控制，限制了实现更定制化结果的能力。

Method: 通过分析DiT模型中的MM-Attention机制，发现Query和Key token共享一个仅与层相关的偏置向量。将该偏置解释为模型的固有编辑行为，而每个token与其对应偏置之间的delta编码了内容特定的编辑信号。提出GRAG方法，重新加权不同token的delta值来调节模型对输入图像相对于编辑指令的关注度。

Result: 在现有图像编辑框架上的大量实验表明，GRAG只需四行代码即可集成，能持续提升编辑质量。与常用的Classifier-Free Guidance相比，GRAG实现了更平滑和更精确的编辑程度控制。

Conclusion: GRAG是一种简单而有效的方法，能够实现对图像编辑强度的连续精细控制，显著提升了现有编辑框架的性能。

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at

*Mia Kan,Yilin Liu,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAGE方法，通过结构引导和生成合成实现零样本视频过渡，在多样片段间产生平滑、语义一致的过渡效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频过渡方法在处理大时间间隔或显著语义差异的片段时，难以保持内容感知和视觉连贯性，需要更好的过渡技术

Method: 结合结构引导（线条图和运动流）与生成合成，采用零样本方法实现结构感知的视频过渡

Result: 在定量指标和用户研究中，SAGE优于传统和生成基线方法，能处理多样片段间的过渡

Conclusion: SAGE方法通过结构感知和生成合成的结合，有效解决了视频过渡中的语义一致性和视觉连贯性问题

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

TL;DR: MIC-BEV是一个基于Transformer的鸟瞰图感知框架，用于基础设施多摄像头3D目标检测，支持异构摄像头配置，在传感器退化下保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于摄像头的检测模型在基础设施场景中表现不佳，面临多视角设置、异构摄像头配置、视觉质量退化和多样化道路布局等挑战。

Method: 提出图增强融合模块，利用摄像头与BEV单元之间的几何关系和潜在视觉线索，将多视角图像特征集成到BEV空间中。

Result: 在M2I合成数据集和真实数据集RoScenes上的广泛实验表明，MIC-BEV在3D目标检测中达到最先进性能，在极端天气和传感器退化条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MIC-BEV展示了在实际部署中的潜力，为智能交通系统的基础设施感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

### [68] [Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709)
*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现预训练的视觉变换器（ViTs）能够自然涌现出物体绑定能力，即识别哪些图像块属于同一物体的能力，这种能力在自监督模型中表现更强，并主动指导注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉变换器是否自然具备物体绑定能力，即识别图像中哪些补丁属于同一物体的能力，这对于理解物体表示和认知过程具有重要意义。

Method: 使用相似性探针从ViT各层的补丁嵌入中解码"IsSameObject"属性，比较不同预训练目标（自监督vs监督学习）下该能力的表现，并进行消融实验验证其功能。

Result: 自监督ViTs（DINO、MAE、CLIP）能够可靠地涌现物体绑定能力，准确率超过90%，而ImageNet监督模型表现明显较弱；IsSameObject信号编码在物体特征的低维子空间中，并主动指导注意力。

Conclusion: ViTs自然具备物体绑定能力，这种能力不是架构的副产品，而是通过特定预训练目标获得的，挑战了ViTs缺乏物体绑定的传统观点。

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMoE是一个针对扩散变换器（DiT）的混合专家框架，通过两步路由器和显式路由指导来解决视觉MoE中专家专业化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将MoE应用于DiT的尝试效果有限，主要原因是语言和视觉token存在根本差异：语言token语义密集且变化显著，而视觉token具有空间冗余和功能异质性，阻碍了视觉MoE中的专家专业化。

Method: 提出ProMoE框架，包含两步路由器：1）条件路由根据功能角色将图像token划分为条件集和无条件集；2）原型路由通过可学习原型基于语义内容细化条件图像token的分配。还提出路由对比损失来增强原型路由过程。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ProMoE在Rectified Flow和DDPM训练目标下均超越了最先进方法。

Conclusion: ProMoE通过显式路由指导和两步路由机制有效解决了视觉MoE中的专家专业化问题，为扩散变换器的MoE应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: URSA是一个离散视频生成框架，通过全局迭代优化离散时空token，结合线性化度量路径和分辨率相关时间步偏移机制，实现高效的高分辨率图像合成和长视频生成，性能媲美连续扩散方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续空间视频生成发展迅速，而离散方法由于误差累积和长上下文不一致性问题而落后，需要重新审视离散生成建模来弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出URSA框架，将视频生成任务表述为离散时空token的迭代全局优化，包含线性化度量路径和分辨率相关时间步偏移两个关键设计，以及异步时间微调策略。

Result: 在具有挑战性的视频和图像生成基准测试中，URSA始终优于现有离散方法，并实现了与最先进连续扩散方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: URSA是一个简单而强大的离散生成建模框架，能够有效缩小与连续方法在可扩展视频生成方面的差距，同时需要更少的推理步骤。

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Generative View Stitching (GVS)方法，通过并行采样整个序列来解决自回归视频扩散模型在相机引导生成中的碰撞问题，实现与预定义相机轨迹的忠实对应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型虽然能够生成稳定且与历史一致的长序列，但无法利用未来信息来指导当前生成。在相机引导的视频生成中，这会导致与生成场景的碰撞，进而导致自回归快速崩溃。

Method: GVS采样算法将扩散缝合技术从机器人规划扩展到视频生成，兼容任何使用Diffusion Forcing训练的现成视频模型。引入Omni Guidance技术通过同时条件化过去和未来来增强时间一致性，并提出循环闭合机制实现长程连贯性。

Result: GVS实现了稳定、无碰撞、帧间一致且能够闭合循环的相机引导视频生成，适用于各种预定义相机路径，包括奥斯卡·路透斯瓦德的不可能阶梯。

Conclusion: GVS方法有效解决了自回归视频扩散模型在相机引导生成中的局限性，通过并行采样和全向引导实现了高质量、连贯的视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best
viewed as videos at https://andrewsonga.github.io/gvs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STNet的谱变换网络，通过谱变换技术改进基于深度学习的算子特征值问题求解方法，在精度上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算子特征值问题在科学和工程中很重要，但数值方法受维度灾难限制。现有深度学习方法性能依赖于算子的谱分布，更大的特征值间隙能提高精度。

Method: 使用STNet在每次迭代中利用近似特征值和特征函数对原始算子进行谱变换，将其转化为等价但更容易的问题。具体采用收缩投影排除已求解特征函数对应的子空间，并使用滤波器变换放大目标区域特征值。

Result: 大量实验表明STNet始终优于现有的基于学习的方法，在精度上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 谱变换技术能有效提升基于深度学习的算子特征值问题求解方法的性能，STNet通过谱变换实现了更好的精度。

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

Motivation: 完全解析大规模湍流的直接数值模拟计算成本过高，需要数据驱动的机器学习替代方案。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的谱元架构，引入SEM标记化将流场分解为网格尺度和亚网格尺度分量，结合谱方法精度和注意力机制可扩展性。

Result: 在256^3分辨率下达到DNS级别精度，速度提升30倍；在比训练域大4倍的未见域上保持物理不变指标的准确性；在The Well基准套件中准确再现复杂动力学。

Conclusion: EddyFormer成功结合了谱方法精度和Transformer可扩展性，为大规模湍流模拟提供了高效准确的解决方案，展示了良好的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析通过联合分析文本和图像数据，能比单模态方法提供更丰富准确的情感理解

Method: BERT-ViT-EF结合BERT和ViT编码器进行早期融合；DTCN在BERT后添加Transformer层优化文本上下文，并使用对比学习对齐文本和图像表示

Result: 在TumEmo数据集上达到78.4%准确率和78.3% F1分数，在MVSA-Single上达到76.6%准确率和75.9% F1分数

Conclusion: 早期融合和更深层次的上下文建模在基于Transformer的多模态情感分析中具有显著优势

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

*Alexandre Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析MACE力场的计算瓶颈，评估低精度执行策略，发现cuEquivariance后端和混合精度推理可显著加速SO(3)-等变力场，同时保持物理保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习力场计算成本高，需要系统评估SO(3)-等变模型如MACE是否可通过降低精度算术和GPU优化内核来降低成本而不损害物理保真度。

Method: 端到端和逐块分析MACE性能，比较e3nn和cuEquivariance后端，评估FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16设置（使用FP32累加）在推理、NVT/NPT水模拟和训练中的表现。

Result: cuEquivariance减少推理延迟约3倍，线性层使用BF16/FP16可额外提速4倍，NVT/NPT MD中的能量和热力学观测量保持在运行间变异性内，但训练中使用半精度权重会降低力RMSE。

Conclusion: 融合等变内核和混合精度推理可显著加速最先进力场，对下游MD影响可忽略。建议默认使用cuEquivariance和FP32，线性层启用BF16/FP16以获得最大吞吐量，训练保持FP32。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性攻击对医疗AI系统构成严重威胁，可能导致治疗延误和误诊，特别是在弱势群体中，需要研究这些漏洞及其防御方法。

Method: 通过威胁建模、实验基准测试和模型评估，在皮肤病数据集上进行实证实验，测试对抗性训练和蒸馏等防御方法。

Result: 对抗性攻击显著降低分类准确率，防御措施能降低攻击成功率，但需在干净数据上的模型性能之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 需要整合技术、伦理和政策方法，构建更具韧性和公平性的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出了DiNo和RanBu两种浅层森林方法，通过将少量深度受限的树转换为高效的基于距离的预测器，显著降低随机森林的推理延迟和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机森林在表格预测任务中表现优异，但由于依赖数百棵深树，导致推理延迟高和内存需求大，限制了在延迟敏感或资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: DiNo通过观测对的最远共同祖先测量同源距离，RanBu对Breiman经典邻近度度量应用核平滑。两种方法都在森林训练后完全操作，不额外生长树，仅需轻量级矩阵向量操作调整单个带宽参数h。

Result: 在3个合成基准和25个公共数据集上，RanBu匹配或超过全深度随机森林的准确性（特别是在高噪声设置中），同时将训练加推理时间减少高达95%。DiNo在低噪声机制中以适度的计算成本实现了最佳偏差-方差权衡。两种方法可直接扩展到分位数回归，保持准确性的同时获得显著速度提升。

Conclusion: DiNo和RanBu提供了高效的浅层森林替代方案，显著降低了随机森林的计算成本，同时保持了竞争性的预测性能，特别适用于延迟敏感和资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

Abstract: This PhD thesis investigates the societal impact of machine learning (ML). ML
increasingly informs consequential decisions and recommendations, significantly
affecting many aspects of our lives. As these data-driven systems are often
developed without explicit fairness considerations, they carry the risk of

appropriate measurement of fairness in ML systems, systematic decomposition of
ML systems to anticipate bias dynamics, and effective interventions that reduce
algorithmic discrimination while maintaining system utility. I conclude by
discussing ongoing challenges and future research directions as ML systems,
including generative artificial intelligence, become increasingly integrated
into society. This work offers a foundation for ensuring that ML's societal

*Shuang Geng,Wenli Zhang,Jiaheng Xie,Rui Wang,Sudha Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，将抑郁症预测与知识扩展结合在迭代学习循环中，通过社交媒体内容同时提升预测准确性和医学知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然整合医学知识来提高预测准确性，但忽视了通过预测过程同时扩展知识的机会。社交媒体用户生成内容为抑郁症等心理健康状况提供了实时、自我报告指标。

Method: 开发闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，包含两个阶段：知识感知的抑郁症检测阶段（LLM联合执行抑郁症检测和实体提取，知识图谱表示和加权实体以优化预测性能），以及知识精炼和扩展阶段（在专家监督下将LLM提取的新实体、关系和实体类型纳入知识图谱）。

Result: 使用大规模用户生成内容，该框架同时提高了预测准确性和医学理解。专家评估确认发现了与现有文献互补的临床有意义症状、共病和社会触发因素。

Conclusion: 概念化和实施了预测-学习和学习-预测作为相互加强的过程，推进了预测分析方法论和理论理解。该框架展示了计算模型和领域知识的共同演化，为适用于其他动态风险监测环境的自适应、数据驱动知识系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TracePile是一个包含260万样本的大规模语料库，将代码执行转化为显式的链式执行推理过程，显著提升了语言模型在数学、代码、逻辑和算法等领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码作为训练源具有丰富的逻辑结构和多样推理范式，但原始代码中的隐式推理和语法噪声使得直接训练效果不佳，需要将代码执行转化为显式的推理过程。

Method: 构建TracePile语料库，将代码执行转化为链式执行推理，包含变量追踪问题和代码重写，采用三种训练设置：继续预训练、预训练后指令微调、两阶段微调。

Result: 在四个基础模型和20个基准测试上均获得一致提升，LLaMA3.1-8B在九个数学数据集上平均提升7.1%，在LiveCodeBench、CRUX和MMLU上也有明显增益。

Conclusion: TracePile通过将代码执行转化为显式推理过程，有效提升了语言模型的推理能力，证明了代码作为推理训练源的潜力。

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了数字到事件推理和解码任务，通过推理感知框架从数值时间序列中推断可解释的结构化事件，解决了现有方法在揭示驱动数值变化的潜在事件和解释推理过程方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多模态推理方面表现出色，但对纯数值时间序列信号的理解仍然有限。现有方法主要关注预测或趋势描述，未能揭示驱动数值变化的潜在事件或解释其背后的推理过程。

Method: 提出了一个推理感知框架，包含代理引导的事件提取器(AGE)、基于标记多元霍克斯过程的合成生成器(EveDTS)，以及结合时间序列编码器和结构化解码器的两阶段微调管道。模型明确推理数值变化，生成中间解释，并输出结构化事件假设。

Result: 在多领域数据集上的实验表明，该方法在事件级精度和召回率方面显著优于强大的LLM基线。

Conclusion: 这些结果为弥合定量推理和语义理解提供了新方向，使LLM能够直接从数值动态中解释和预测事件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO)框架，通过最大似然估计将偏好优化与排名选择建模统一起来，支持多种人类反馈格式，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐主要依赖成对偏好优化，忽略了从更丰富的人类反馈（如多选比较和top-k排名）中学习的机会。

Method: 提出了RCPO统一框架，支持基于效用和基于排名的选择模型，包含多种现有成对方法，并为更丰富的反馈格式提供原则性训练目标。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-it模型上的实证研究表明，RCPO在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard基准测试中始终优于竞争基线。

Conclusion: RCPO展示了直接利用排名偏好数据结合适当选择模型可以实现更有效的对齐，为将排名选择建模融入LLM训练提供了通用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMCOMP是一种基于解码器大型语言模型的科学数据有损压缩方法，通过将3D场量化为离散token、Z-order曲线排列和覆盖引导采样，训练自回归transformer建模token转换，在严格误差约束下实现比现有方法高30%的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率科学模拟和观测系统产生海量时空数据，需要高效的有界误差压缩。同时，解码器大型语言模型在建模复杂序列数据方面表现出色。

Method: 将3D场量化为离散token，通过Z-order曲线排列保持局部性，应用覆盖引导采样提高训练效率，训练带时空嵌入的自回归transformer建模token转换，压缩时执行top-k预测并存储排名索引和回退校正以确保严格误差边界。

Result: 在多个再分析数据集上的实验表明，LLMCOMP在严格误差约束下始终优于最先进的压缩器，压缩比提高高达30%。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了LLMs作为高保真科学数据通用压缩器的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"噪声组合采样"的新方法，通过合成来自噪声子空间的最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，从而在扩散模型的生成过程中自然嵌入条件信息，无需依赖逐步超参数调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型在零样本逆问题求解中表现出色，但存在一个固有困境：过度整合观测信息会破坏生成过程，而整合不足则无法强调逆问题的约束条件。

Method: 噪声组合采样方法，从噪声子空间合成最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，替代标准DDPM过程中的噪声项，使条件信息自然嵌入生成过程。

Result: 该方法可应用于广泛的逆问题求解器，包括图像压缩，特别是在生成步骤数T较小时，以可忽略的计算开销实现优越性能，显著提高鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 噪声组合采样方法有效解决了扩散模型中条件信息整合的困境，实现了在逆问题求解中条件信息的自然嵌入，无需超参数调整，具有优越的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

Motivation: 受集合包含问题应用的启发，研究如何设计集合到向量的函数，使得集合的自然偏序关系得以保持，即S⊆T当且仅当F(S)≤F(T)。

Method: 提出了单调分离集合函数的概念，建立了向量维度必要性的上下界。对于无限基础集，提出了弱MAS模型，该模型具有Holder连续性稳定性。

Result: 在无限基础集情况下，MAS函数不存在，但弱MAS模型能够满足松弛的MAS性质。实验表明该模型在集合包含任务中表现优于标准集合模型。

Conclusion: MAS函数可用于构建通用模型，这些模型在构造上是单调的，并且能够逼近所有单调集合函数。提出的弱MAS模型在集合包含任务中具有实际优势。

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字个人助理需要高质量标注，但用户标注通常存在错误和噪声。之前的研究通过比较离线主动标注和被动数据来评估标注准确性，但缺乏最终用户的确认。

Method: 在真实世界条件下评估SKEL性能，让实际用户基于当前视角和需求精炼输入标签。研究涉及大学生使用iLog移动应用四周。

Result: 结果突显了在用户努力和数据质量之间找到适当平衡的挑战，以及使用SKEL的潜在好处，包括减少标注工作量和提高收集数据质量。

Conclusion: SKEL在真实用户环境中表现出减少标注工作量和提高数据质量的潜力，但需要仔细平衡用户参与程度和数据质量要求。

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Motivation: 多模态分子模型常面临3D构象不可靠性和模态崩溃问题，限制了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

Motivation: Transformer在高能粒子碰撞中能有效捕捉全局和局部相关性，但在高数据吞吐量环境（如CERN LHC）中部署困难，二次复杂度需要大量资源并增加推理延迟

Method: 基于linformer架构，引入基于运动学特征的空间感知粒子分区，计算物理意义区域间的注意力；使用卷积层捕捉局部相关性，借鉴喷注物理学的见解

Conclusion: SAL-T通过物理启发的空间分区和局部相关性捕捉，在保持高性能的同时实现了高效的线性注意力计算，解决了Transformer在高数据吞吐量环境中的部署挑战

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LRQK是一种两阶段框架，通过低秩分解查询和键矩阵来减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时保持注意力输出的精确性，在长上下文推理中实现显著内存节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着输入文本长度增加，LLMs中的KV缓存带来高昂的GPU内存成本，限制了在资源受限设备上的长上下文推理。现有方法如KV量化和剪枝会损失数值精度或保留次优的键值对。

Method: 两阶段框架：在预填充阶段将全精度查询和键矩阵分解为紧凑的秩-r因子；在解码阶段使用低维投影计算代理注意力分数，采用混合GPU-CPU缓存和命中-未命中机制，仅传输缺失的全精度KV对。

Result: 在RULER和LongBench基准测试中使用LLaMA-3-8B和Qwen2.5-7B进行广泛实验，LRQK在长上下文设置中匹配或超越领先的稀疏注意力方法，同时提供显著的内存节省且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: LRQK框架有效解决了长上下文推理中的内存瓶颈问题，通过低秩分解和智能缓存机制实现了内存效率与模型精度的良好平衡。

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing

Conclusion: CLP能有效压缩大语言模型，显著优于现有剪枝方法，且可与量化技术无缝结合进一步压缩模型，仅带来轻微性能损失。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

Conclusion: SAEA框架通过系统性地建模和调整时空自相关误差，有效解决了交通预测中误差自相关性问题，为深度神经网络交通预测提供了通用改进方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷等离子体作为一种环保方法能促进种子发芽，但由于种子-等离子体-环境的复杂相互作用，结果难以预测，需要建立可靠的预测模型。

Method: 使用机器学习模型（GB、XGB、ET及其混合模型）预测五种作物在介质阻挡放电等离子体处理下的发芽提升，通过特征工程分析等离子体参数的影响。

Result: Extra Trees模型表现最佳（R²=0.919），特征缩减后提升至R²=0.925。发现了激素响应规律：7-15kV、200-500s处理效果最佳，放电功率≥100W时发芽率最高。不同物种和品种的预测精度存在差异。

Conclusion: 该机器学习框架成功预测了冷等离子体处理对种子发芽的提升效果，为精准农业中的种子处理优化提供了决策支持工具。

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型的对齐面临序列对数似然难以计算和配对偏好数据收集成本高的问题，需要开发更高效的对齐方法。

Method: 使用ELBO替代扩散对数似然，结合基于前景理论的无配对偏好优化目标(KTO)，并采用方差减少技术来稳定训练梯度。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，ELBO-KTO在kto-mix-14k和UltraFeedback-Binary数据集上分别获得65.9%和62.3%的调整胜率，在GSM8K、MMLU等下游任务中表现与基础模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: 无配对偏好优化是扩散语言模型中配对对齐的可行替代方案，为扩散模型对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn

that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for

Motivation: 单一模型难以捕捉交通流数据中复杂的非线性多尺度时间模式，需要更有效的预测方法。

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

Method: 开发新的度量标准来衡量专家间的叠加效应，分析网络稀疏性（活跃专家与总专家比例）对模型行为的影响，提出基于单语义特征表示的专家专业化新定义。

Result: 发现网络稀疏性（而非特征稀疏性或重要性）是MoE模型的关键特征，网络稀疏性越高，模型越趋向单语义性，专家会自然地围绕连贯的特征组合组织。

Conclusion: MoE模型中的网络稀疏性可能实现既保持性能又具有可解释性的模型，挑战了可解释性与能力不可兼得的传统观点。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

Result: 大量实验表明，DBLoss能显著提升最先进模型在多样化真实世界数据集上的性能表现。

Conclusion: DBLoss为时间序列损失函数设计提供了新的视角，是一种简单而有效的分解式损失函数。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

Motivation: 传统（准）随机初始化策略忽略了两个关键因素：(a) 空间填充设计可能不利于减少预测不确定性；(b) 初始化期间的高效超参数学习对于高质量预测至关重要，这可能与空间填充设计相冲突。

Method: HIPE是一种基于信息论的获取策略，在高斯过程设置中推导出闭式表达式，平衡预测不确定性减少与超参数学习。

Result: 在主动学习和少样本贝叶斯优化的大量实验中，HIPE在预测精度、超参数识别和后续优化性能方面优于标准初始化策略，特别是在大规模批次、少样本设置中。

Conclusion: HIPE方法在贝叶斯优化的初始化阶段显著提升了性能，特别适用于现实世界中常见的大批次、少样本应用场景。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

*Gokturk Aytug Akarlar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Chimera神经-符号-因果架构，整合LLM策略师、形式化验证符号约束引擎和因果推理模块，在电商环境中实现稳定高性能决策，相比纯LLM代理显著提升利润和品牌信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自主决策代理存在严重脆弱性，相同能力仅因提示框架不同而产生截然不同的结果，在高风险领域部署存在风险，需要架构层面的安全保障。

Method: 设计三组件架构：LLM策略师负责策略生成，形式化验证符号约束引擎确保决策合规性，因果推理模块进行反事实推理。在包含价格弹性、信任动态和季节性需求的电商环境中进行52周模拟测试。

Result: 纯LLM代理在销量优化场景中造成99K美元总损失，在利润优化场景中品牌信任度下降48.6%。添加符号约束可避免灾难但仅达到Chimera利润的43-87%。Chimera实现最高回报（152万和196万美元，部分案例达220万美元）并提升品牌信任度（+1.8%和+10.8%，部分案例+20.86%）。

Conclusion: 架构设计而非提示工程决定了自主代理在生产环境中的可靠性。TLA+形式化验证证明所有场景下零约束违规。

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Transformer和BiLSTM的并行预测框架，用于混沌系统预测。该混合模型通过双分支架构分别捕获长程依赖和局部时间特征，在Lorenz系统的两个代表性任务中表现出优于单分支架构的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 混沌系统的非线性特性导致对初始条件极度敏感和复杂的动力学行为，传统方法难以同时捕获时间序列的局部特征和全局依赖关系。

Method: 采用Transformer和BiLSTM的双分支并行架构：Transformer分支主要捕获长程依赖，BiLSTM分支专注于提取局部时间特征，两个分支的互补表示在特征融合层中进行融合。

Result: 在Lorenz系统的自主演化预测和未测量变量推断两个任务中，所提出的混合框架始终优于单分支架构，展示了其在混沌系统预测中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: Transformer与BiLSTM的并行混合框架能够有效克服传统方法的局限性，在混沌系统预测中实现了更好的性能，证明了该方法的实用价值。

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在复杂任务如讽刺检测上表现不佳，需要跨模态识别相关线索并进行语用推理来推断说话者意图。

Method: 引入MUStReason诊断基准，包含模态特定相关线索和推理步骤标注。提出PragCoT框架，将问题解构为感知和推理，引导模型关注隐含意图。

Result: 通过MUStReason对视频语言模型的讽刺分类性能和生成推理进行定量和定性评估。

Conclusion: PragCoT框架能够有效引导视频语言模型关注讽刺检测中的隐含意图，提升模型在复杂语用推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

TL;DR: 提出了一个减轻奖励模型中虚假相关性的原则性框架，通过识别非虚假潜在变量来训练更稳健的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐技术中的奖励模型经常利用虚假相关性（如响应长度、歧视、谄媚等），这已成为日益关注的问题。

Method: 首先构建数据生成过程模型，假设观测数据来自虚假和非虚假潜在变量；然后使用变分推断恢复非虚假变量，并利用它们训练奖励模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效缓解了虚假相关问题，产生了更稳健的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够减轻奖励模型中的偏见，同时保留反映真实偏好的潜在因素。

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Cobweb/4V模型在持续学习中对灾难性遗忘的鲁棒性，验证了三个假设：自适应结构重组、稀疏选择性更新和信息论学习方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的核心挑战，先前研究表明Cobweb/4V在视觉领域对灾难性遗忘具有鲁棒性，本文旨在探究这种鲁棒性的原因。

Method: 通过比较Cobweb/4V与神经网络基线（包括新提出的CobwebNN），在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、MedMNIST和CIFAR-10等不同复杂度数据集上进行实验，验证三个假设。

Result: 实验表明自适应结构重组增强了学习可塑性，稀疏更新有助于减少干扰，信息论学习过程无需回顾过去数据即可保留先前知识。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了缓解灾难性遗忘的机制，突显了基于概念和信息论方法在构建稳定自适应持续学习系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Relaxed Sequence Sampling (RSS)方法，这是一个结合结构预测和进化信息的MCMC框架，用于蛋白质设计，相比现有方法能产生更多可设计结构和更大结构多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质设计方法如RSO依赖单路径梯度下降，忽略了序列空间约束，限制了设计的多样性和可设计性。

Method: RSS在连续logit空间中运行，结合梯度引导探索和蛋白质语言模型引导的跳跃，其能量函数耦合了AlphaFold2的结构目标和ESM2的序列先验。

Result: 在蛋白质结合物设计任务中，RSS比RSO基线方法产生了5倍多的可设计结构和2-3倍的结构多样性，计算成本相同。

Conclusion: RSS是一个原则性的方法，能够有效探索蛋白质设计空间。

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统台风集合预报系统计算成本高且难以完全捕捉大气非线性特征，需要开发更高效的AI预报方法。

Method: FuXi-ENS采用可学习扰动方案生成集合预报，并与ECMWF-ENS在2018年全球90个台风上进行系统性对比分析。

Result: FuXi-ENS在台风相关物理变量预测和路径预报方面优势明显，集合离散度更小，但强度预报仍低于观测值。动力学分析显示其能更好捕捉大尺度环流和暖核结构。

Conclusion: 可学习扰动方案有潜力提升台风预报技能，为基于AI的极端天气集合预报提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在语言模型中成功提取可解释特征，但在音频生成中面临挑战：音频的密集特性使得压缩后语义含义模糊，自动特征表征有限。

Method: 在音频自编码器潜在空间上训练稀疏自编码器，然后学习从SAE特征到离散化声学属性的线性映射。

Result: 在连续（DiffRhythm-VAE）和离散（EnCodec, WavTokenizer）音频潜在空间上验证了方法，分析了DiffRhythm文本到音乐模型，展示了音高、音色和响度在生成过程中的演化。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于音频模态，还可扩展到视觉潜在空间生成模型的可解释性分析。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

Motivation: 理解自适应梯度方法（如Adam）相对于梯度下降在模型泛化方面的差异，特别是Adam对数据旋转的敏感性如何影响其学习非线性决策边界的能力。

Method: 分析Adam在数据旋转下的表现，并应用正交重参数化方法使一阶优化方法对数据旋转具有等变性。

Result: 即使小的数据旋转也会使Adam失去丰富性偏置，收敛到远离贝叶斯最优决策边界的线性边界。正交重参数化能够恢复Adam学习丰富决策边界的能力。

Conclusion: Adam对数据旋转的敏感性限制了其泛化优势，但通过正交重参数化可以解决这一问题，使Adam保持其学习非线性决策边界的能力。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，计算开销成为任务特定微调的主要瓶颈。虽然LoRA通过将权重更新限制在低维子空间有效降低了成本，但这种限制会阻碍效果并减慢收敛速度。

Method: 通过累积连续的低秩增量来渐进式构建高秩权重更新。识别每个更新的最优低秩矩阵以最小化损失函数并逼近全参数微调。通过适当缩放原始低秩矩阵的列来形成最优选择，实现高效无缝优化。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决LoRA的限制，在保持计算效率的同时实现更好的性能和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

Motivation: 解决现有方法如PPO、GRPO直接最大化累积奖励的局限性，以及离线方法如DPO、UNA缺乏探索能力的问题，旨在开发一个更稳定、高效且具有良好泛化能力的对齐框架。

Method: 结合GRPO的在线多响应生成和归一化、DPO的隐式奖励公式以及UNA的隐式-显式奖励对齐原则，通过联合归一化隐式和显式奖励，将优化问题转化为凸的MSE损失。

Result: GIFT在数学基准测试中实现了优越的推理和对齐性能，收敛更快，泛化更好，训练过拟合显著减少，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: GIFT通过隐式-显式奖励对齐提供了一个稳定、高效且具有探索能力的LLM对齐框架，在性能和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 基于图的特征选择与AI技术相结合的方法能够有效解决电动公交车预测性维护的挑战，为主动维护提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance
strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.

*Cristobal Heredia,Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出RS-ORT算法，通过两阶段优化和专门的分支定界方法解决大规模连续特征回归树训练问题，相比现有方法在计算效率和泛化能力上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIP方法在回归任务中要么仅限于二元特征，要么在处理大规模连续数据时计算不可行。简单二值化连续特征会牺牲全局最优性并产生过深树。

Method: 将最优回归树训练重构为两阶段优化问题，提出RS-ORT算法：专门在树结构变量上分支的分支定界算法，结合边界收紧技术（闭式叶节点预测、经验阈值离散化、精确深度-1子树解析）和可分解上下界策略。

Result: 在包含二元和连续特征的回归基准测试中，RS-ORT在训练和测试性能上优于最先进方法。对于200万样本的连续特征数据集，能在4小时内获得保证的训练性能、更简单的树结构和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RS-ORT算法通过创新的优化框架和边界收紧技术，有效解决了大规模连续特征回归树训练的计算挑战，在保证最优性的同时显著提升了计算效率和泛化性能。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

*Ayush Sawarni,Sahasrajit Sarmasarkar,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出将响应时间数据整合到人类偏好学习框架中，通过证据积累漂移扩散模型利用响应时间来推断偏好强度，显著提高了奖励模型学习的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于二元偏好数据的偏好学习框架未能充分利用用户决策过程中的时间信息，而响应时间包含了关于偏好强度的有价值信息。

Method: 提出结合响应时间和二元选择数据的新方法，使用证据积累漂移扩散模型，开发了Neyman正交损失函数，实现了理论最优的收敛速率。

Result: 理论分析表明，对于线性奖励函数，传统偏好学习的误差率随奖励幅度呈指数级增长，而响应时间增强方法将其降低为多项式增长。实验验证了该方法在图像偏好学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: 整合响应时间信息可以显著提高偏好学习的样本效率和理论性能，为奖励模型学习提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法主要关注成对因果关系，忽略了变量组之间的相互作用和集体因果影响，特别是在非线性多变量时间序列中。

Method: 1. 使用深度学习联合建模所有时间序列组的结构关系；2. 对训练好的模型应用组级干预；3. 进行模型不变性测试来确定变量组间的因果链接。

Result: 在模拟数据集上表现出优于现有方法的组级因果关系识别能力，在脑网络和气候生态系统等真实数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 将组级干预应用于深度学习模型并结合不变性测试，能够有效揭示复杂因果结构，为神经科学和气候科学等领域提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

TL;DR: 研究表明在注意力机制中，Query权重是冗余的，可以将其移除，从而将非嵌入参数减少8%以上，且不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM中的注意力机制都使用Query、Key、Value权重三元组，但理论上可能存在冗余，希望通过简化模型结构来减少参数数量。

Method: 在理论分析的基础上，在完整复杂度的GPT-3小模型架构上进行实验验证，比较标准模型与移除Query权重后的简化模型。

Result: 移除Query权重的简化模型在验证损失上与标准基线模型表现相当，证实了Query权重的冗余性。

Conclusion: Query权重在注意力机制中是冗余的，这一发现在小规模模型上得到验证，值得在大规模模型上进一步研究。

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

TL;DR: 将折扣奖励MDP的几何解释扩展到平均奖励情况，统一了两种分析框架，证明了在唯一且遍历的最优策略下，值迭代算法具有几何收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDP理论分析通常分为平均奖励和折扣奖励两种情况，虽然相似但分开分析。本文旨在统一这两种情况的分析框架。

Method: 将折扣奖励MDP的几何解释扩展到平均奖励情况，建立统一的几何分析框架。

Result: 成功将折扣奖励情况下的主要结果扩展到平均奖励情况：在唯一且遍历的最优策略下，值迭代算法具有几何收敛速率。

Conclusion: 通过几何解释的统一框架，实现了平均奖励和折扣奖励MDP分析的统一，并证明了值迭代算法在平均奖励情况下的几何收敛性。

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

TL;DR: 提出了FOGZO方法，结合STE的高质量有偏梯度和ZO的无偏梯度，在量化感知预训练中改善质量与训练时间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STE提供高质量但有偏的梯度，ZO梯度无偏但计算昂贵，需要一种方法能减少STE偏差同时降低ZO方法的计算成本。

Method: 提出First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (FOGZO)，通过结合STE和ZO方法的优势来优化量化参数训练。

Result: 相比STE，在相同迭代次数下：DeiT Tiny/Small准确率提升1-8%，ResNet 18/50提升1-2%，LLaMA模型困惑度提升1-22点；相比n-SPSA，在相同损失下计算量减少796倍。

Conclusion: FOGZO方法在量化感知预训练中有效平衡了训练质量和计算效率，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了差分隐私机制（DP-SGD和PDP-SGD）作为联邦学习中梯度泄漏攻击防御的有效性，发现DP-SGD能显著降低泄漏风险但牺牲模型性能，而PDP-SGD保持性能但防御效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护敏感数据不共享，但仍易受梯度泄漏攻击威胁，需要评估差分隐私机制的实际防御效果。

Method: 在模拟联邦学习环境中，评估不同隐私级别下计算机视觉模型的性能，并分析从截获梯度中重建私有数据的质量。

Result: DP-SGD显著减轻梯度泄漏攻击风险，但模型效用有适度折衷；PDP-SGD保持强分类性能但无法有效防御重建攻击。

Conclusion: 在分布式学习场景中，需要超越理论保证对隐私机制进行实证评估，因为信息泄漏可能对数据安全和隐私构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需数据的神经网络算子，用于求解Navier-Stokes方程，无需配对解数据，支持实时推理和大规模集合预报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维流动模型的集合模拟计算成本过高，传统神经算子需要大量数据且难以推广到3D流动。

Method: 采用物理基础架构，输入初始条件、边界条件和强迫函数，直接输出解，对高变异性具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在2D基准测试和3D测试案例中，准确率超过现有神经算子，集合模拟效率高于传统数值求解器，首次实现3D Navier-Stokes方程的数据自由求解。

Conclusion: 通过结合数值基础架构和机器学习可扩展性，为端到端科学模拟和预测建立了实用的数据自由高保真PDE代理模型路径。

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Abstract: In this work, a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model has
been developed, combining excitable-system dynamics with diffusion processes
and sharing conceptual features with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Designed to
capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, particularly
electrophysiological processes, the model was solved numerically to generate
time-series data. These data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an
Echo State Network (ESN), which successfully reproduced the system's dynamic
behavior. The results demonstrate that simulating biological dynamics using
data-driven, multifunctional ESN models is both feasible and effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对LLM在国际象棋能力评估的方法零散且范围狭窄，难以准确衡量LLM的象棋理解能力及其随规模、训练后方法或架构选择的变化。

Method: 创建ChessQA基准测试，包含五个任务类别：结构、模式、短战术、局面判断和语义，对应玩家掌握象棋知识的抽象层次。

Result: 评估当代LLM发现，在所有五个类别中都存在持续的弱点，并提供了按类别的结果和错误分析。

Conclusion: ChessQA提供了更全面的象棋能力评估框架，支持进一步研究，并将发布代码、定期更新的数据集和公共排行榜。

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链监控为AI安全提供了独特机会，但训练实践或模型架构的变化可能影响这种可监控性，需要方法来测量和保持。

Method: 使用自动评分器提示来评估思维链的可读性（人类能否理解推理过程）和覆盖度（思维链是否包含人类得出相同结论所需的所有推理）。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中，前沿模型展现出较高的可监控性。自动评分器经过合成思维链退化测试验证有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发者提供了跟踪设计决策对可监控性影响的工具，是故意规避模型对抗性压力测试的补充而非替代。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

Abstract: The proliferation of probabilistic AI has promoted proposals for specialized

shortcomings by proposing an all-transistor probabilistic computer that

Result: DATE在保持模型生成能力的同时，在多概念生成和文本引导图像编辑等任务中提供优于固定文本嵌入的文本-图像对齐。

Conclusion: DATE能够在不需额外训练的情况下，在扩散采样过程中动态调整文本条件，提高文本-图像对齐质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

Result: 模型在多个PM变量（PM1、PM2.5、PM10）预测上表现出显著改进，特别是在极端条件下，同时不损害全局准确性。

Conclusion: SynCast为下一代空气质量早期预警系统提供了可扩展的基础，支持脆弱区域的气候健康风险缓解。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局-局部融合采样策略，通过结合全局和局部采样的优势来提高PINNs的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs的精度严重依赖于配置点的放置。全局采样覆盖整个域但计算成本高，局部采样效率高但可能忽略已学习好的区域。需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 使用高斯噪声按残差反比缩放来扰动训练点，在困难区域集中采样同时保持探索。引入轻量级线性代理来近似全局残差分布，降低计算开销。

Result: 在基准PDE上的大量实验表明，GLF相比全局和局部采样策略，在精度和效率上都有持续改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为增强PINNs在解决复杂高维PDE中的可靠性和效率提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Motivation: 现有研究假设模型输入的m个变量是预先确定的，但如何从n个位置中选择最优的m个变量作为输入从未被研究过。这个问题在实际应用中很重要，因为传感器数量通常远少于需要监测的位置数量。

Method: 提出了一个统一框架，包含三个关键技术：(1) 掩码变量参数剪枝，通过基于分位数的掩码逐步剪枝信息量较少的变量和注意力参数；(2) 优先变量参数重放，重放低损失的过去样本以保持模型稳定性；(3) 动态外推机制，通过可学习的空间嵌入和邻接信息将信息从选中的变量传播到所有其他变量。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率上都显著优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 联合变量选择和模型优化能够有效提高时空多元时间序列预测的性能，证明了选择最优输入变量的重要性。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Motivation: 传统投影式异常检测方法存在两个主要局限：依赖固定统计指标和假设单一数据结构，这限制了它们在复杂数据上的性能。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用核PCA线性化非线性数据结构，第二阶段进行局部聚类处理多模态分布，并引入广义损失函数PLO替代固定指标。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的5折交叉验证显示，该方法在具有挑战性结构的数据集上显著优于基线方法，特别是在多聚类数据和复杂高维数据上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该工作为异常检测问题提供了强大的新工具，证明了混合多阶段架构的重要性，消融研究确认核化和局部化阶段的协同组合对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

Result: 实验结果表明RED有效缓解了负迁移，并实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过减少环境分歧可以有效缓解负迁移问题，RED方法在无监督领域自适应中表现出色

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

Conclusion: RAP框架通过检索增强预测，结合参数化和非参数化方法的优势，生成更物理真实的长期预测

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Result: 在20个蛋白质靶标的模拟中，FolDE比最佳基线ALDE方法多发现23%的前10%突变体（p=0.005），找到前1%突变体的可能性高55%。

Conclusion: FolDE通过改进的预热启动和批量选择策略，显著提高了蛋白质定向进化的效率，并作为开源软件提供给所有实验室使用。

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

*Kanghyun Choi,Hyeyoon Lee,SunJong Park,Dain Kwon,Jinho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FALQON是一个消除FP8量化LoRA微调开销的框架，通过直接合并LoRA适配器到FP8量化主干中，实现3倍训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8量化主要加速大维度矩阵乘法，但在LoRA微调中，小维度矩阵的量化开销会削弱速度优势。

Method: 直接合并LoRA适配器到FP8量化主干，重新设计前向和反向计算以减少量化开销，引入行级代理更新机制。

Result: 相比现有量化LoRA方法，FALQON实现约3倍训练加速，同时保持相似精度水平。

Conclusion: FALQON提供端到端FP8工作流，无需后训练量化，为高效大规模模型微调提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

*Gabriel O. dos Santos,Esther Colombini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了视觉语言模型中的上下文学习能力，发现当前模型主要依赖文本线索而未能有效整合视觉信息，揭示了多模态上下文学习的关键局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在大语言模型中已被广泛研究，但在视觉语言模型中的有效性仍未被充分探索。本文旨在系统评估VLMs的多模态上下文学习能力。

Method: 评估了涵盖四种架构的七个视觉语言模型，在三个图像描述基准上进行测试。分析了提示设计、架构选择和训练策略对多模态ICL的影响，并首次分析了注意力模式随上下文演示数量增加的变化。

Result: 训练图像-文本交错数据能提升ICL性能，但不保证能有效整合演示示例中的视觉和文本信息。指令调优改善了指令跟随能力，但会减少对上下文演示的依赖。注意力分析显示当前VLMs主要关注文本线索，未能充分利用视觉信息。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态上下文学习方面存在关键局限性，特别是缺乏有效整合视觉和文本信息的能力，这为提升其从多模态上下文示例中学习的能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

Motivation: 受高斯设置中I-MMSE恒等式的启发，为离散设置推导类似结果，为离散扩散模型提供理论基础，证明常用损失函数不仅是变分边界，而且是紧致且有原则的对数似然估计器。

Method: 引入信息-最小去噪分数熵关系，将数据与其扩散版本之间的互信息与最小去噪分数熵损失联系起来；扩展到掩码扩散，建立信息-最小去噪交叉熵关系，将交叉熵损失与离散掩码过程中的互信息连接。

Result: 实验在合成和真实世界数据上验证了估计器的准确性、方差稳定性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了对数似然的时间积分分解，支持时间无关公式、条件似然估计和耦合蒙特卡洛似然比估计等实际扩展。

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

Motivation: 从多任务专家演示中学习参数化技能，以显著提高对未见任务的泛化能力，解决潜在变量模型中常见的退化问题。

Method: 使用时间变分推理和信息论正则化方法，联合学习参数化技能策略和元策略，元策略在每个时间步选择适当的离散技能和连续参数。

Result: 在LIBERO和MetaWorld基准测试中，DEPS优于多任务和技能学习基线方法，能够发现可解释的参数化技能，如抓取技能的参数定义抓取位置。

Conclusion: 从多任务专家演示中学习参数化技能能显著改善泛化能力，DEPS方法能发现有意义且可适应的技能表示。

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

*Mortesa Hussaini,Jan Theiß,Anthony Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为FLIU的个性化联邦学习方法，通过自适应个性化因子来解决异构数据环境下的客户端漂移问题，并在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行了全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异构数据联邦学习中，本地模型会收敛到各自的局部最优解，偏离全局数据分布。FedAvg等聚合方法会产生客户端漂移，导致对大多数客户端次优的更新。现有个性化联邦学习方法主要关注本地性能，但忽略了FedAvg带来的泛化能力这一重要鲁棒性优势。

Method: 提出了FLIU方法，在FedAvg基础上增加简单的个性化步骤和自适应个性化因子。在单个通信轮次的不同阶段评估方法性能，使用MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集，在IID、病理性非IID以及新开发的Dirichlet分布等多种分布条件下进行实验。

Result: 通过实证评估比较了不同方法，FLIU方法在保持良好泛化能力的同时提升了本地性能。新设计的Dirichlet分布测试环境能够更好地测试算法在复杂数据异构性下的表现。

Conclusion: 个性化联邦学习需要在本地性能和泛化能力之间取得平衡。FLIU方法通过自适应个性化因子有效解决了客户端漂移问题，同时保持了模型的泛化能力，为异构数据环境下的联邦学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2ConS是一种图引导的概念选择方法，通过选择重要文档块和构建LLM无关的概念图，显著降低了基于图的RAG系统的构建成本，同时提高了检索效果和回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的RAG方法在生物医学、法律等领域需要多跳推理，但现有方法需要大量LLM调用来提取实体和关系，在大规模应用中成本过高。

Method: 提出Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS)，包含块选择方法和LLM无关的概念图。前者选择重要文档块减少KG构建成本，后者零成本填补块选择带来的知识缺口。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的评估显示，G2ConS在构建成本、检索效果和回答质量方面均优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: G2ConS通过概念选择和概念图的有效结合，成功解决了图基RAG系统在大规模应用中的成本问题，同时保持了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

Motivation: 研究因果CNN在多模态频率时间序列中的行为特性，探索其与FIR滤波器的等效关系，以增强对动态系统建模的可解释性。

Method: 使用具有准线性激活函数的因果CNN，采用长卷积核处理多模态频率时间序列，利用卷积的结合律性质将整个网络简化为等效单层FIR滤波器。

Conclusion: 因果CNN与FIR滤波器的等效性为理解CNN在稀疏频率信号上的频谱学习行为提供了新视角，对动态响应物理系统的建模和识别具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架能有效解决电池模型参数识别中的计算效率和精度问题，适用于实际应用中的动态工况。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet建立了一个通用的数据驱动框架，用于发现和解释非平衡动力学。

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能分布式训练模型而不共享数据，但梯度反演攻击挑战了其隐私保护特性。现有的SPEAR攻击虽然理论突破，但受限于指数级时间复杂度，无法处理大批次数据。

Method: 应用最先进的稀疏字典学习技术来解决线性层ReLU激活的梯度反演问题，使攻击在计算上可行。

Result: SPEAR++保留了SPEAR的所有优势特性（如对DP噪声和FedAvg聚合的鲁棒性），同时能够处理10倍大的批次大小。

Conclusion: SPEAR++显著提升了梯度反演攻击的实用性，使联邦学习系统的隐私漏洞评估更加高效。

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

Conclusion: 该基准测试为ICU生命体征数据插补提供了比较基础，有助于推动更多机器学习模型进入临床实践

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了PRIVET方法，通过极值统计和最近邻距离来检测深度生成模型中的隐私泄露，为每个合成样本分配个体隐私泄露分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型常在敏感数据上训练，存在隐私泄露风险，现有方法主要依赖全局标准，缺乏样本级别的隐私评估方法。

Method: 使用极值统计和最近邻距离分析，提出PRIVET算法，该算法与数据模态无关，可为每个合成样本计算隐私泄露分数。

Result: PRIVET能可靠检测各种数据模态下的记忆化和隐私泄露，包括高维数据、小样本遗传数据，甚至在欠拟合情况下也有效。

Conclusion: PRIVET提供了数据集级别和样本级别的隐私评估，优于现有方法，同时揭示了现有计算机视觉嵌入在识别近似重复样本时的局限性。

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏线性赌博机算法要么在数据丰富时最优但维度依赖性强，要么在数据稀缺时维度独立但遗憾界较差。需要一种能同时适应两种极端情况的算法

Method: 使用稀疏乐观信息导向采样，通过时间依赖的学习率来平衡信息获取和遗憾最小化

Result: SOIDS算法在理论上同时实现了数据丰富和数据稀缺两种极端情况下的最优最坏情况遗憾界

Conclusion: SOIDS是第一个无需贝叶斯假设就能同时适应数据丰富和数据稀缺两种极端情况的稀疏线性赌博机算法

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the data-poor
regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the number of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algorithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, providing the first algorithm
that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich
and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good performance of
SOIDS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PaTaRM框架，通过偏好感知奖励机制和动态规则适应，将成对数据转化为点式训练信号，无需显式点式标注，实现了高效、可泛化且可解释的奖励建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对奖励模型依赖二元标签导致推理不匹配，点式方法需要复杂绝对标注且成本高昂，需要一种统一框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 结合偏好感知奖励机制和任务自适应规则系统，利用成对数据构建点式训练信号，动态生成评估标准。

Result: 在RewardBench和RMBench上平均相对提升4.7%，在IFEval和InFoBench基准测试中下游RLHF性能平均提升13.6%。

Conclusion: PaTaRM框架有效解决了传统奖励模型的局限性，提供了高效、可泛化和可解释的奖励建模方案。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

Result: 该方法在保持高准确率的同时提供了可解释的预测，通过实体类别限制提高了规则应用的针对性，LLM方法有效解决了类别未知问题。

Conclusion: 扩展的基于规则框架在时间知识图谱预测中实现了准确性和可解释性的平衡，实体类别整合和LLM驱动的类别生成方法增强了系统的实用性和透明度。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

*Junlin Mu,Hantao Huang,Jihang Zhang,Minghui Yu,Tao Wang,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALS框架通过将KV缓存投影到紧凑的潜在空间，在该空间中进行稀疏token选择，避免了完整KV缓存重建的开销，实现了高效的KV缓存压缩和推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型的KV缓存存在内存带宽需求高和缓存大小大的问题，而现有的低秩压缩方法由于RoPE机制会导致精度下降或新的速度瓶颈。

Method: 提出SALS框架：1）将KV缓存通过低秩投影到紧凑潜在空间；2）在该空间中使用无RoPE的查询-键交互进行稀疏token选择；3）仅重建重要token子集。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7b-chat和Mistral-7b等模型上验证，SALS实现了6.4倍KV缓存压缩和5.7倍注意力算子加速，端到端吞吐量相比GPT-fast提升1.4倍（4K序列）和4.5倍（32K序列）。

Conclusion: SALS通过潜在空间稀疏注意力机制，在保持竞争性精度的同时，实现了SOTA的KV缓存压缩和推理加速性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方程发现(ED)的二元分类框架EDC，能够发现指定决策边界位置和形状的解析函数，在二元分类任务中优于现有ED方法，性能与最先进分类方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方程发现在回归任务中已取得显著成功，但缺乏针对分类任务的专门方法。本文旨在将方程发现技术扩展到二元分类问题，发现可解释的决策边界函数。

Method: 提出EDC框架，使用适度复杂度的语法来发现决策边界函数。语法包含线性项、二次项、指数项以及特征乘积项（用于捕捉XOR类依赖关系），形成可配置的加性项序列。

Result: 在人工和真实数据集上的实验表明，EDC能够发现目标方程的结构和参数值，在二元分类中优于现有ED方法，性能与最先进分类方法相当，且不会导致过拟合。

Conclusion: EDC为二元分类提供了一种新的方程发现方法，能够发现可解释的决策边界函数。所提出的语法在灵活性和防止过拟合之间取得了良好平衡，且可根据领域需求进行配置。

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

TL;DR: Cluster-PFN是一种基于Transformer的模型，用于无监督贝叶斯聚类，能够处理缺失数据并快速估计聚类数量和分配的后验分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯聚类虽然能处理不确定性，但在大规模数据上计算成本高。真实数据集常包含缺失值，简单插补方法忽略了不确定性，导致结果不理想。

Method: 使用Transformer架构扩展Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs)，完全在有限高斯混合模型(GMM)先验生成的合成数据集上训练，学习估计聚类数量和聚类分配的后验分布。

Result: 比AIC、BIC和变分推断(VI)等手工模型选择方法更准确地估计聚类数量，聚类质量与VI相当但速度快几个数量级。在高缺失率的真实基因组数据集上优于基于插补的基线方法。

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN能够提供可扩展且灵活的贝叶斯聚类解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

TL;DR: 提出了感知学习(PeL)范式，通过任务无关信号优化智能体的感官接口，与下游决策学习解耦，直接针对无标签的感知属性进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将感知和决策耦合在一起优化，这可能导致感知质量不佳。PeL旨在分离感知和决策学习，专注于提升感知质量而不依赖特定任务。

Method: 定义感知属性独立于目标函数或重参数化，使用表示不变性指标评估感知质量，证明PeL更新与贝叶斯任务风险梯度正交。

Result: 提供了任务无关的评估指标套件来认证感知质量，实现了感知学习与决策学习的有效分离。

Conclusion: PeL范式能够独立优化感知质量，为构建更鲁棒的智能体感知系统提供了理论基础和方法框架。

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段数据驱动方法，通过实例硬度和置信度拒绝机制提升医疗领域机器学习模型的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗等高风险领域应用广泛，但常忽略不确定性，在低置信度时仍提供预测，影响可靠性

Method: 1. 训练阶段使用实例硬度过滤问题实例优化数据集；2. 推理阶段引入置信度拒绝机制，仅保留可靠预测

Result: 在三个真实医疗数据集上验证，证明该方法能有效提升模型可靠性，同时平衡预测性能和拒绝率

Conclusion: 实例硬度过滤与置信度拒绝相结合的方法为安全关键应用中部署ML系统提供了实用方案

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个代表性-隐私-效用（RPU）框架，系统评估公共交通合成出行数据的质量，发现合成数据并不固有保证隐私，CTGAN模型在隐私与代表性/效用之间提供了最平衡的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成数据评估的碎片化问题，现有评估通常局限于人口层面代表性或记录层面隐私，缺乏对群体层面变化或任务特定效用的考虑。

Method: 提出RPU框架，在三个互补维度（代表性、隐私、效用）和三个层次（记录、群体、人口）上系统评估合成出行数据，整合一致指标量化相似性、披露风险和实践有用性。

Result: 基准测试12种代表性生成方法，结果显示合成数据不固有保证隐私，不存在"一刀切"模型，隐私与代表性/效用的权衡明显，CTGAN提供了最平衡的权衡。

Conclusion: RPU框架为研究人员和从业者提供了系统可复现的基础，用于比较合成数据生成技术并在公共交通应用中选择合适方法。

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

Motivation: 现有的组合合成库规模庞大（数十亿化合物），虚拟筛选通常只能评估不到0.1%的化合物，可能遗漏许多高分化合物。现有算法在约束条件变化时缺乏摊销能力。

Conclusion: APEX协议能够高效处理大规模组合合成库的虚拟筛选问题，在有限计算预算下实现近似穷尽搜索。

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

Result: 在基准任务上的实验表明，该方法加速收敛并优于标准基线方法，即使使用最少或次优演示数据

Conclusion: 通过演示初始化价值函数为稀疏奖励RL提供了有效的先验知识，显著改善了学习效率

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

Motivation: 传统强化学习算法通常针对离散时间动态设计，而现实世界控制系统往往是连续时间的，需要开发能够处理连续时间动态的强化学习方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程和贝叶斯神经网络等概率模型学习非线性ODE系统动力学的不确定性感知模型，COMBRL算法贪婪地最大化外部奖励和模型认知不确定性的加权和。

Conclusion: COMBRL为连续时间模型强化学习提供了一种可扩展且样本高效的方法，在标准和无监督RL设置下均表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIMIC-Sepsis是一个从MIMIC-IV数据库衍生的脓毒症队列和基准框架，支持脓毒症轨迹的可重复建模，包含35,239名ICU患者的时间对齐临床变量和标准化治疗数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脓毒症研究依赖过时数据集、不可复现的预处理流程，且临床干预覆盖有限，需要更可靠的研究平台。

Method: 基于Sepsis-3标准建立透明预处理流程，包括结构化插补策略和治疗纳入，提供早期死亡率预测、住院时间估计和休克发作分类等基准任务。

Result: 实证结果显示，纳入治疗变量显著提升模型性能，特别是基于Transformer的架构表现更佳。

Conclusion: MIMIC-Sepsis为重症监护研究中的预测和序列模型评估提供了稳健平台。

Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet
existing research often relies on outdated datasets, non-reproducible
preprocessing pipelines, and limited coverage of clinical interventions. We
introduce MIMIC-Sepsis, a curated cohort and benchmark framework derived from
the MIMIC-IV database, designed to support reproducible modeling of sepsis
trajectories. Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned
clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.

Conclusion: 提出的数据感知LoRA初始化理论框架和LoRA-DA算法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了微调性能。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准直接预测方法在存在标签自相关时，条件负对数似然的估计存在偏差，需要改进分布对齐方法。

Method: 引入联合分布Wasserstein差异来上界条件差异，该差异可从经验样本中进行可微估计，并与基于梯度的训练无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明DistDF提高了多种预测模型的性能，并实现了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: DistDF通过最小化条件分布差异有效解决了标签自相关带来的估计偏差问题，提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Motivation: 解决当前量子机器学习方法在预测精度、鲁棒性和可解释性之间难以平衡的问题。

Method: 集成混合量子神经网络与经典深度学习层，采用对抗评估器计算反馈损失来同时优化预测精度和模型可解释性，并扩展了量子GAN和自监督变体。

Result: Vanilla模型在回归指标上表现最一致：RMSE=0.27，MSE=0.071，MAE=0.21，R²=0.59。

Conclusion: 量子启发方法与经典架构结合可开发轻量级、高性能且可解释的预测模型，推动量子机器学习超越当前局限性。

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current
limitations.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个综合数据驱动框架，通过结合多域信号处理的半监督和无监督学习方法，从复合材料结构中学习健康指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于材料特性变化、随机损伤演化和多种损伤模式，从航空航天复合材料结构中提取可靠健康指标具有挑战性。制造缺陷和使用中事件进一步增加了复杂性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：(1) Diversity-DeepSAD半监督异常检测，使用连续辅助标签作为假设损伤代理；(2) DTC-VAE无监督方法，通过显式趋势约束嵌入单调性准则。使用多激发频率导波监测疲劳加载下的复合材料结构。

Result: 使用FFT特征时，Diversity-DeepSAD模型达到81.6%性能，DTC-VAE提供最一致的健康指标，性能达92.3%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DTC-VAE方法在健康指标学习方面表现最佳，能够提供一致且可靠的损伤监测结果。

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ILP集成方法需要多次训练算法来学习多个假设，计算成本高。本文旨在通过单次训练保存中间假设来降低计算开销。

Method: 仅训练一次ILP算法，保存所有中间假设，然后使用最小描述长度加权方案组合这些假设。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著提升ILP预测性能的同时，几乎不增加额外计算成本，为ILP集成学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most
ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble
methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In
this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate
hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length
weighting scheme. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks, including game
playing and visual reasoning, show that our approach improves predictive
accuracy by 4% with less than 1% computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于排序的因果发现方法由于使用单一因果排序，限制了模型表示能力，导致虚假伪影。需要解决时序数据因果发现的组合复杂性挑战。

Method: 使用扩散过程进行因果发现，通过分数匹配实现高效Hessian估计，整合多个有效因果排序来恢复有向无环图的传递闭包。

Conclusion: DOTS为时序因果发现提供了一个可扩展且准确的解决方案，通过多排序方法有效克服了单排序方法的局限性。

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Motivation: 研究ReLU网络在稳健记忆任务中的参数复杂性，即在保证训练样本周围μ球内预测一致性的同时，对具有ε分离的不同标签点进行插值所需的参数数量。

Method: 建立了参数数量关于稳健性比率ρ=μ/ε的函数上下界，对整个ρ∈(0,1)范围进行了细粒度分析，改进了现有结果的紧密度。

Result: 获得了比现有工作更紧的上下界，揭示了稳健记忆的参数复杂度在ρ较小时与非稳健记忆匹配，但随着ρ增大而增长。

Conclusion: 稳健记忆的参数复杂度依赖于稳健性比率ρ，当ρ较小时与非稳健记忆相同，但随着ρ增大需要更多参数来保证稳健性。

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

Conclusion: Pearl在蛋白质-配体共折叠方面建立了新的最先进性能，模型性能与训练中使用的合成数据集大小直接相关。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效提取有序可识别的特征函数，为特征选择和表示学习提供了理论依据和实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

Motivation: 尽管选项框架天然适合分层控制应用和自动驾驶任务，但现有深度强化学习方法很少使用该框架，因此研究其在高速公路自动驾驶中的应用。

Method: 定义具有安全和舒适约束的纵向和横向操作专用选项，提出分层控制设置，采用最先进的强化学习技术开发算法，通过分别选择纵向和横向控制动作实现灵活策略。

Conclusion: 选项框架能有效整合先验领域知识，约束学习驾驶行为，混合选项策略具有与人类驾驶员相同的表达能力和灵活性，且比传统连续动作策略更易解释。

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

Motivation: RLHF已成为训练大型语言模型的关键技术，但其理论理解仍然有限。现有研究主要关注基于奖励的Bradley-Terry偏好模型，而本文考虑更一般的偏好模型。

Method: 研究KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性，直接使用经验估计(贪婪采样)而非构造乐观或悲观估计。

Result: 获得了比现有方法有显著数量级改进的性能保证，并专门针对Bradley-Terry模型验证了贪婪采样的充分性。

Conclusion: 在RLHF中，贪婪采样方法已经足够有效，这源于KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

*Eamon Duede*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI在科学问题解决中的作用及其对学科创造性的影响，区分创造性方法与创造性成果，并通过数学案例说明AI可能取代学科创造性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI如何影响科学领域的创造性，特别是学科创造性的概念及其在科学追求中的价值。

Method: 基于创造力哲学区分创造性方法与成果，引入学科创造性概念，并通过两个数学案例进行分析。

Result: 计算可以扩展学科创造性，但某些AI方法可能取代学科创造性，从而改变科学追求的价值。

Conclusion: AI在科学问题解决中的应用可能削弱学科创造性，对科学追求的价值产生潜在负面影响。

Abstract: This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific
problem-solving, with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity.
Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between
creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of
disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific
pursuit.

*Eline M. Bovy,Caleb Probine,Marnix Suilen,Ufuk Topcu,Nils Jansen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多环境POMDPs（ME-POMDPs）及其推广形式AB-POMDPs，用于处理具有离散模型不确定性的POMDP问题，并开发了精确和近似算法来计算鲁棒策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当多个领域专家对问题建模存在分歧时，需要找到对环境中所有可能POMDP模型都鲁棒的单一策略，以最大化最坏情况下的奖励。

Method: 将ME-POMDPs推广为具有初始信念集合的AB-POMDPs；证明任意ME-POMDP可简化为仅变化转移/奖励函数或观测/奖励函数的等价形式；开发精确和近似（基于点）的鲁棒策略计算算法。

Result: 能够在标准POMDP基准测试的多环境扩展中计算策略，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ME-POMDPs和AB-POMDPs为处理模型不确定性提供了有效框架，所开发的算法能够计算鲁棒策略，适用于存在多个可能环境模型的实际问题。

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于测试时调优的框架，利用预训练transformer模型直接从串联质谱和分子式端到端生成分子结构，无需数据库匹配或中间步骤，在两个基准测试上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前串联质谱分析方法依赖数据库匹配或需要中间片段预测的多步骤流程，难以识别数据库中未收录的化合物，需要一种能够直接从质谱数据生成分子结构的端到端方法。

Method: 利用测试时调优增强预训练transformer模型，直接从串联质谱和分子式进行端到端分子结构生成，无需手动标注和中间步骤，能够动态适应新的质谱数据。

Result: 在NPLIB1和MassSpecGym两个基准测试上分别比现有最佳方法DiffMS提升了100%和20%，测试时调优相比传统微调在MassSpecGym上获得62%的相对性能增益，生成的分子候选结构准确，为人工解释提供可靠指导。

Conclusion: 该框架通过测试时调优实现了直接从质谱数据生成分子结构的突破，显著提升了未知化合物的识别能力，为代谢组学、天然产物发现等领域提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

### [195] [Policy Cards: Machine-Readable Runtime Governance for Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24383)
*Juraj Mavračić*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Policy Cards是一种机器可读的部署层标准，用于表达AI代理的操作、监管和伦理约束，使其能够在运行时遵循这些约束，成为部署代理的组成部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决AI代理在运行时缺乏明确的约束机制，以及现有透明度工具（如模型卡、数据卡等）无法提供规范性指导的问题，需要一种能够编码允许/拒绝规则、义务和证据要求的标准化框架。

Method: 通过Policy Cards定义规范性层，编码允许/拒绝规则、义务、证据要求，并与NIST AI RMF、ISO/IEC 42001和欧盟AI法案等保证框架进行映射。每个Policy Card可以自动验证、版本控制，并与运行时执行或持续审计管道链接。

Result: Policy Cards为自主代理提供了可验证的合规性，在多代理生态系统中形成了分布式保证的基础，实现了高层治理与工程实践的整合。

Conclusion: Policy Cards提供了一种实用机制，将高层治理与工程实践相结合，实现了大规模的可问责自主性，为AI代理的合规运行提供了标准化解决方案。

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

TL;DR: 病理学基础模型在癌症诊断和预后方面表现不佳，存在诊断准确率低、鲁棒性差、计算需求大等根本性弱点，需要重新思考该范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在计算机视觉和语言处理领域取得了革命性突破，但在计算病理学中的快速应用并未带来预期的突破。

Method: 通过系统评估分析病理学基础模型的根本弱点，识别出七个相互关联的原因。

Result: 发现当前病理学基础模型存在诊断准确率低、鲁棒性差、几何不稳定性、计算需求大和安全漏洞等严重问题。

Conclusion: 病理学基础模型与组织形态学的本质存在概念上的不匹配，需要从根本上重新思考该范式。

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

TL;DR: 提出Law in Silico框架，使用LLM模拟法律社会，验证犯罪趋势并分析法律系统对弱势群体的保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实法律实验成本高且不可行，需要AI模拟来验证法律理论和支持法律管理，LLM具备世界知识和角色扮演能力，适合法律系统模拟。

Method: 开发Law in Silico框架，基于LLM的智能体模拟法律场景，包含个体决策和立法、裁决、执法等制度机制。

Result: 模拟犯罪率与真实数据比较显示，LLM智能体能够复现宏观犯罪趋势，微观模拟表明功能完善、透明、适应性的法律系统能更好保护弱势个体权利。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效模拟法律系统，为法律理论验证和系统优化提供可行方案，特别强调透明和适应性法律机制的重要性。

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

*Zhenyu Zhang,Tianyi Chen,Weiran Xu,Alex Pentland,Jiaxin Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCAP是一个用于大语言模型的递归上下文感知推理和规划框架，通过计划分解、结构化重新注入父计划和内存高效执行机制，显著提升了长时程任务的执行成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的顺序提示方法容易产生上下文漂移、目标信息丢失和循环失败问题，而分层提示方法则存在跨级连续性弱或运行时开销大的问题。

Method: ReCAP结合三种关键机制：计划分解（生成完整子任务列表，执行第一项并优化剩余）、结构化重新注入父计划（在递归返回时保持多级上下文一致性）和内存高效执行（限制活动提示使成本随任务深度线性扩展）。

Result: 在多个长时程推理基准测试中，ReCAP显著提高了子目标对齐和成功率，在严格pass@1协议下，同步Robotouille提升32%，异步Robotouille提升29%。

Conclusion: ReCAP框架能够将高层目标与低层动作对齐，减少冗余提示，并在递归过程中保持连贯的上下文更新，有效解决了长时程任务中的推理和规划挑战。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

Motivation: 解决去中心化条件下多智能体在共享环境中的协调挑战，探索语言模型在目标分配问题中的应用潜力。

Method: 智能体基于环境结构化表示独立生成目标偏好排序，通过固定冲突解决规则进行目标分配，无需协商或迭代协调，系统比较不同方法在完全可观测网格环境中的表现。

Result: 基于LLM的智能体在精心设计的提示和定量信息支持下，能够达到接近最优的完成时间，并持续优于传统启发式方法。

Conclusion: 语言模型在去中心化多智能体路径规划的目标分配中具有潜力，信息结构设计对此类系统至关重要。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Motivation: 现有训练算法（SFT、PPO、GRPO）在未见推理任务上泛化能力不足，且过度依赖有偏奖励模型，限制了推理的多样性和可靠性。

Method: 将LVLMs推理重新表述为后验推理，采用摊销变分推理框架，引入稀疏奖励函数鼓励多样化的潜在CoT，并使用贝叶斯推理扩展策略替代昂贵的搜索方法。

Result: 在七个推理基准测试中显著提升了最先进LVLMs的性能，在有效性、泛化性和可解释性方面均有改进。

Conclusion: 该方法通过变分推理和多样性强化学习有效解决了现有训练算法的局限性，为LVLMs的推理能力提供了更可靠和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现实应用（从生物学到医学和社会科学）中的因果效应依赖于具体环境（如年龄、国家、剂量、基因型或实验室协议），需要一种能够形式化这种环境依赖性的因果发现方法。

Method: 使用judo演算，结合Lawvere-Tierney模态算子j来选择相关环境，在层拓扑中实现j-稳定因果推断。将这种方法与标准的基于分数、约束和梯度的因果发现方法相结合。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于层拓扑的分散式因果发现在计算效率上有显著提升，并且在合成和真实世界数据集（生物学和经济学）上的性能优于经典因果发现方法。

Conclusion: judo演算提供了一种构造性且一致的方法来处理因果效应的环境依赖性，通过分散式计算实现了效率和性能的提升。

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

### [206] [The Sign Estimator: LLM Alignment in the Face of Choice Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23965)
*Aymane El Gadarri,Ali Aouad,Vivek F. Farias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为符号估计器的新方法，通过将交叉熵损失替换为二元分类损失，解决了传统LLM对齐方法在人类偏好异质性下的不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对齐方法对人类偏好的异质性很敏感，拟合简单的概率模型到成对比较数据会产生不一致的群体平均效用估计。

Method: 使用符号估计器，在聚合步骤中用二元分类损失替代交叉熵损失，在温和假设下实现一致的序数对齐。

Result: 在LLM对齐的数字孪生模拟中，符号估计器显著减少了偏好失真，将估计误差降低了近35%，与真实群体偏好的不一致性从12%降至8%。

Conclusion: 符号估计器提供了一种简单、可证明一致且高效的估计方法，在保持现有LLM对齐管道实现简单性的同时，优于显式建模用户异质性的面板数据启发式方法。

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

### [207] [Learning Individual Movement Shifts After Urban Disruptions with Social Infrastructure Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23989)
*Shangde Gao,Zelin Xu,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合个体社会基础设施韧性(SIR)和空间上下文的深度学习模型，用于预测破坏性事件后个体移动模式的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测破坏性事件前个体移动模式变化具有挑战性：缺乏衡量个体异质性社会基础设施韧性的指标，个体移动模式与空间背景的复杂交互关系未被充分捕捉，以及个体级移动数据稀疏且不适合传统预测方法。

Method: 将个体的社会基础设施韧性(SIR)整合到条件深度学习模型中，利用大规模稀疏个体级数据捕捉个体移动模式与局部空间背景的复杂关系。

Result: 实验表明，结合个体SIR和空间上下文可以增强模型预测事件后个体移动模式的能力。条件模型能够捕捉到具有相似事件前模式但SIR不同的个体在移动模式上的差异变化。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了个体社会基础设施韧性和空间上下文对于预测破坏性事件后移动模式变化的重要性，为理解个体对社区资源需求的变化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

*İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya,İ. Esra Büyüktahtakın,Parshin Shojaee,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究利用大型语言模型(LLMs)发现了两种新的启发式算法EDDC和MDDC，用于解决单机总延迟调度问题，在500个作业规模下表现出色，证明了人-LLM协作在NP难组合优化问题中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统启发式算法在单机总延迟调度问题上表现有限，而精确方法在大规模问题上计算不可行，需要开发新的高性能启发式算法。

Method: 通过LLM发现两种新启发式算法EDDC和MDDC，基于经典的EDD和MDD规则改进，并与混合整数规划和动态规划等精确方法进行基准测试。

Result: 对于超过100个作业的实例，EDDC改进了经典EDD规则，MDDC始终优于传统启发式算法，在更大更复杂的实例上与精确方法保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 人-LLM协作能够为NP难约束组合优化问题产生可扩展的高性能启发式算法，即使在有限资源下通过有效配置也能实现。

Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization
literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)
problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a
single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We
develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger
(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date
(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that
employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered
algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time
derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare
their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across
various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than
100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become
computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD
rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently
outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact
approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows
that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics
for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited
resources when effectively configured.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了OneCast框架，通过将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，分别使用不同的生成路径进行建模，以解决跨域时间序列预测中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域时间序列预测在处理异构时间序列数据时面临泛化挑战，现有方法将时间序列视为无差别的序列，未能显式解耦其内在结构组件。

Method: OneCast框架将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量：季节性分量通过轻量级投影模块使用可解释基函数重建周期模式；趋势分量通过语义感知分词器编码为离散标记，并使用掩码离散扩散机制进行推断。

Result: 在八个领域的广泛实验中，OneCast大多优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过结构化分解和模块化建模，OneCast能够有效捕捉季节性模式并跟踪领域特定趋势，在跨域时间序列预测中表现优异。

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: LLMLogAnalyzer是一个基于聚类和大型语言模型的日志分析聊天机器人，通过结合机器学习算法解决LLM在结构化文本处理方面的限制，显著提升了日志分析的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志对网络安全至关重要，但大量多样化日志数据的分析面临高成本、缺乏专业知识和时间限制等挑战，使得许多组织难以进行基本分析。

Method: 采用模块化架构，包括路由器、日志识别器、日志解析器和搜索工具，结合LLM和机器学习算法，通过聚类方法解决LLM的上下文窗口限制和结构化文本处理能力差的问题。

Result: 在四个不同领域日志和多种任务上的评估显示，相比最先进的基于LLM的聊天机器人（如ChatGPT、ChatPDF和NotebookLM），性能提升39%到68%，鲁棒性显著增强，ROUGE-1分数的四分位距减少93%。

Conclusion: LLMLogAnalyzer通过其模块化设计增强了LLM在结构化文本分析中的能力，提高了准确性和鲁棒性，为网络安全专家和非技术用户提供了有价值的日志分析工具。

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

TL;DR: 比较经典物理模型和机器学习模型在电动汽车跟驰行为预测中的表现，发现随机森林模型在所有场景下都优于经典模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车普及，需要理解其驾驶行为以提升交通安全和开发智能驾驶系统。

Method: 使用真实世界数据集，比较IDM、OVM、OVRV、CACC等经典物理模型与随机森林回归器的预测性能。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，RMSE分别为0.0046（中等间距）、0.0016（长间距）和0.0025（超长间距）。经典模型中CACC表现最好，长间距RMSE为2.67。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在预测电动汽车跟驰行为方面优于经典物理模型，对模拟EV行为和混合自动驾驶交通动态分析具有重要价值。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

TL;DR: 开发了HistoLens系统，让病理学家能用自然语言提问组织切片问题，AI提供结构化报告和可视化证据，增强医生对AI诊断的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了让医生真正信任人工智能，需要让AI的推理过程透明化，就像咨询同事一样，而不是使用黑盒系统。

Method: 创建HistoLens系统，将病理学家的自然语言问题转化为精确查询，AI提供结构化报告和热力图可视化证据，并训练AI专注于患者组织而忽略背景噪声。

Result: 实现了透明协作的工作流程，病理学家保持专家主导地位，使用可信的AI助手验证见解，做出更快、更自信的诊断。

Conclusion: 通过提供透明的推理过程和可视化证据，HistoLens系统成功建立了医生对AI的信任，实现了人机协作的诊断工作流程。

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

Motivation: 传统手动事件管理在面临海量异构可观测数据时劳动密集且容易出错，现有自动化方法存在泛化能力差、可解释性有限和部署成本高的问题。

Method: 使用免训练数据处理器将异构可观测数据转换为结构化文本描述，采用多代理协作框架实现透明可审计的诊断推理，并引入双自演化机制支持持续能力增长。

Result: 在OPENRCA基准测试中达到最先进的性能，证明OpsAgent具有泛化性、可解释性、成本效益和自演化能力。

Conclusion: OpsAgent是一个实际可部署且可持续的解决方案，适用于真实云系统的长期运维。

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

Motivation: 当前多跳问答数据集稀缺，且大多仅用于评估而非训练，手动构建成本高昂且难以扩展，这成为训练高能力检索推理代理的关键数据瓶颈。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架能够有效生成高质量的多跳问答训练数据，在保持强评估基准难度特征的同时显著降低了人工成本。

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了Boundless Large Model (BLM₁)，这是一个多模态空间基础模型，能够无缝跨越数字和物理空间，支持跨具身化和跨任务的操作，通过两阶段训练实现高性能的具身智能控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在数字-物理空间泛化能力差，视觉-语言-动作模型缺乏高层推理能力，具身大语言模型局限于数字空间。需要统一的模型来跨越数字和物理空间，同时泛化到不同的具身化和任务。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式：第一阶段通过精选数字语料库向MLLM注入具身知识，保持语言能力；第二阶段训练策略模块，通过意图桥接接口从MLLM提取高层语义来指导控制，无需微调MLLM主干。

Result: 在数字和物理基准测试中，单个BLM₁实例在数字任务上提升约6%，在物理任务上提升约3%，优于MLLMs、ELLMs、VLAs和GMLMs四个模型家族。

Conclusion: BLM₁成功实现了跨空间转移、跨任务学习和跨具身化泛化，为统一的具身智能模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在运动规划中仍局限于单数据集训练，限制了规划鲁棒性。研究发现不同数据集中车辆轨迹分布和历史-未来相关性具有一致性，为多数据集集成提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该工作首次提出了面向自动驾驶决策的多数据集集成规划框架，通过三个协同创新组件实现了跨数据集的有效学习，显著提升了运动规划的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理存在两个主要问题：对历史轨迹的依赖导致错误传播，以及"先决策后观察"机制忽视了关键界面线索。需要开发更鲁棒和泛化的GUI交互方法。

Method: MGA将GUI交互重构为"先观察后决策"原则，每个步骤建模为独立的环境状态三元组：当前截图、任务无关的空间信息和动态更新的结构化记忆。

Conclusion: MGA通过观察优先的方法和结构化记忆表示，有效解决了现有GUI代理的错误传播和局部探索偏差问题，为GUI交互提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: MCP-Flow是一个自动化网络代理驱动的管道，用于大规模服务器发现、数据合成和模型训练，显著提升了LLM在MCP生态系统中的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP研究覆盖服务器少、依赖昂贵的人工整理且缺乏训练支持，限制了LLM在真实世界MCP环境中的部署能力。

Method: 通过自动化网络代理驱动管道，从1166个服务器和11536个工具中收集和筛选数据，生成68733个高质量指令-函数调用对和6439条轨迹。

Result: 实验证明MCP-Flow在MCP工具选择、函数调用生成和代理任务性能方面表现优异，远超先前工作。

Conclusion: MCP-Flow为提升LLM代理在真实世界MCP环境中的熟练度提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform
complex, realistic tasks, yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding
Model Contextual Protocol (MCP) ecosystem remains limited. Existing MCP
research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks
training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven
pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training.
MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing
68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far
exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call
generation, and enhanced agentic task performance. MCP-Flow thus provides a
scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP
environments. MCP-Flow is publicly available at

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对MCTS中抽象技术的使用问题，提出了多种内部抽象策略来改进随机平局决胜规则，在多数环境和参数设置下表现优于随机策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS的样本效率问题可以通过状态/动作抽象来解决，但现有抽象算法如pruned OGA在多个动作属于同一抽象节点时使用随机平局决胜规则，这存在改进空间。

Method: 提出并实证评估了多种内部抽象策略，用于处理同一抽象节点中多个动作具有相同UCB值的情况。

Result: 多个提出的策略在大多数环境和参数设置下表现优于随机策略。

Conclusion: 内部抽象策略的选择对MCTS性能有重要影响，提出的替代策略能有效提升抽象MCTS的性能。

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

*Jiayu Liu,Wei Dai,Zhenya Huang,Ning Miao,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM内部行为的自我指示器方法，通过计算输入问题与输出推理路径的相关矩阵秩来评估推理可信度，无需外部资源即可有效区分正确与错误推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检查方法依赖外部资源（如训练验证器或复杂提示），导致高计算开销且仅适用于特定领域，需要一种更高效通用的LLM输出可信度评估方法。

Method: 利用LLM内部行为，通过计算输入问题与输出推理路径的相关矩阵秩作为推理正确性指标，设计无需训练或复杂提示的即插即用自我指示器方法对候选推理路径进行重加权。

Result: 在多个不同规模和系列的LLM上验证有效，能超过75%准确率区分正确与错误推理路径，在三个推理基准上提升准确率超过8%。

Conclusion: LLM内部行为已隐含其推理路径的可信度信息，基于相关矩阵秩的自我指示器方法能有效、高效地评估和改进LLM推理质量。

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于判断性预测的多智能体框架，通过不同智能体对声明真实性产生分歧并收集正反证据，使用量化双极论证框架(QBAFs)表示证据，结合多种LLM智能体提升预测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 判断性预测作为声明验证的一种形式，需要评估未来事件的可能性。现有方法在证据收集和验证方面存在局限，需要更全面和可解释的框架来整合不同来源的证据。

Result: 在标准判断性预测数据集上的实验表明，组合多个智能体的证据可以提升预测准确性，特别是三个智能体组合时效果更佳，同时提供了可解释的证据组合方式。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架能够有效提升判断性预测的准确性和可解释性，通过整合不同LLM智能体的证据和观点，为声明验证提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

Motivation: 尽管生成式大语言模型在内容分析中展现出超越人工编码者的潜力，但在传播学研究中的方法论整合仍不成熟，需要解决七个关键挑战。

Method: 综合新兴研究，提出包含代码本开发、提示工程、模型选择、参数调优、迭代优化、可靠性验证和性能提升的七步最佳实践框架。

Result: 生成式大语言模型能够在成本和时间大幅降低的情况下，在传播学相关编码任务中超越众包工作者和训练有素的编码者，并能解码隐含意义和上下文信息。

Conclusion: 通过系统化解决七个关键挑战，可以使基于生成式大语言模型的内容分析更易被传播学研究者接受，并确保符合有效性、可靠性、可重复性和研究伦理等学科质量标准。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VDSAgents是一个基于PCS原则的多代理系统，通过模块化工作流程提升LLM驱动数据科学系统的可信度和鲁棒性，在多个数据集上优于现有端到端系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的数据科学系统仅依赖模型内部推理，缺乏科学和理论原则指导，在处理噪声和复杂真实数据集时可信度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 基于PCS原则构建多代理系统，采用模块化工作流程处理数据清洗、特征工程、建模和评估，每个阶段由专门代理负责，结合扰动分析、单元测试和模型验证。

Result: 在9个不同特征的数据集上评估，使用DeepSeek-V3和GPT-4o作为后端，VDSAgents持续优于AutoKaggle和DataInterpreter等最先进的端到端数据科学系统。

Conclusion: 将PCS原则嵌入LLM驱动的数据科学自动化是可行的，能够显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

TL;DR: 提出了"类脑空间"概念，将不同AI模型的内部空间注意力拓扑映射到人类功能脑网络上，创建统一比较框架。研究发现151个Transformer模型在类脑空间中呈现连续弧状几何分布，揭示了模型脑相似度与预训练范式和位置编码方案的关系。

Result: 发现模型在类脑空间中呈现连续弧状几何分布，反映了脑相似度的逐渐增加。不同模型在该几何中的分布模式与其预训练范式（是否强调全局语义抽象）和位置编码方案（是否促进跨模态深度融合）相关。

Conclusion: 类脑空间为跨领域智能的定位、量化和比较提供了首个统一框架，揭示了连接机器与大脑的深层组织原则。模型脑相似度与其下游任务性能并非完全一致。

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体生态系统用于个体化医疗决策支持，从面向平均患者的单一模型转向协调智能，解决罕见病例和边缘群体的医疗AI公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI主要服务于平均患者，在罕见变异、多病共存和代表性不足人群上表现不佳，存在平均患者谬误，损害公平性和信任度。

Method: 构建多智能体生态系统，按器官系统、患者群体和分析模式聚类智能体，共享模型和证据合成工具，通过协调层整合结果并评估可靠性、不确定性和数据密度。

Result: 为临床医生提供决策支持包，包括带置信区间的风险评估、异常值标记和相关证据链接，验证重点从群体平均转向个体可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过从单一模型转向协调智能，使医疗AI与医学首要原则保持一致：提供透明、公平且以个体为中心的医疗服务。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

TL;DR: Orion是一个高效推理框架，通过依赖感知的查询分解和逻辑并行内容扩展，解决了LLM在实时Web应用中的延迟和吞吐量瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理存在计算效率低下的顺序生成和僵化推理策略，无法同时满足实时Web服务对高质量复杂推理和低延迟高吞吐量的双重需求。

Method: 将查询推理分解为两个协同阶段：关键点生成（通过检索增强的少样本提示提炼逻辑结构化的关键点）和内容并行扩展（基于依赖图并发扩展这些点以确保逻辑一致性），并引入跨查询的流水线调度机制。

Result: 实验显示，Orion相比基线实现了最高4.33倍的token生成速度和3.42倍的答案延迟降低，同时推理质量提升达18.75%。

Conclusion: Orion通过显式建模点间依赖关系，在提高推理效率的同时显著提升了推理质量，为LLM在实时Web应用中的部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

TL;DR: 提出了APTBench基准框架，将真实世界智能体任务转化为适合基础模型的多选题或文本补全问题，用于评估预训练阶段的智能体潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预训练基准主要关注孤立静态技能，无法反映模型的智能体能力；而智能体基准通常针对后训练模型，基础模型难以支持多轮任务执行

Method: 将真实世界智能体任务和成功轨迹转化为多选题或文本补全问题，专注于规划和行动等核心智能体能力，覆盖软件工程和深度研究等关键场景

Result: 相比现有通用基准，APTBench能更准确地预测模型作为智能体的下游性能，同时比后训练的端到端智能体评估更轻量、成本更低

Conclusion: APTBench填补了预训练阶段智能体能力评估的空白，为模型训练提供了更有效的指导

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更安全可靠的自主移动代理奠定了基础，推动了移动AI代理安全研究的发展。

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Conclusion: 这两种互补的架构模式使软件代理能够高效构建和维护准确的世界模型，支持可扩展、自适应和可互操作的自动化。

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

Result: 在真实无人机位置控制任务中，平均回报达到400分，显著优于行为克隆和TD3BC等现有方法（最多-200分），训练和最终部署性能提升2.1倍。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对SNN中替代梯度学习的理论理解，并为神经形态控制器在实际机器人系统中的实用训练方法提供了进展。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的两阶段流程，通过跨任务示例和基于图的标签传播来减少对LLM数据标注的依赖，从而降低ICL的标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为新颖或困难任务收集高质量示例成本高昂且劳动密集，需要减少对LLM数据标注的依赖。

Method: 两阶段流程：首先利用现成的跨任务示例提示LLM对少量目标任务实例进行伪标注，然后引入基于图的标签传播方法将标签信息传播到剩余目标示例中，无需额外LLM查询。

Result: 在五个任务上的实验表明，该方法在降低标注成本的同时实现了强劲性能。

Conclusion: 该流程结合了跨任务监督的灵活性和无LLM传播的可扩展性，为ICL提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据合成方法（如随机环境采样或多智能体角色扮演）在真实环境中无法生成高质量的多轮工具调用训练数据，存在目标模型训练、工具架构隔离和多轮逻辑依赖三大挑战。

Method: FunReason-MT框架采用：1）环境-API图交互收集多样化高质量轨迹；2）高级工具查询合成简化复杂查询构建；3）引导迭代链生成复杂思维链。

Result: 在Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3)上，基于FunReason-MT生成数据训练的4B模型在同类规模模型中达到最先进性能，超越了大多数闭源模型。在BFCLv4上的进一步性能提升证实了其可靠性。

Conclusion: FunReason-MT为智能体学习提供了可靠且鲁棒的数据源，能够有效解决多轮工具调用数据合成的复杂性障碍。

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型结合实时反馈将推动下一代精准病害管理的发展，但需要解决仿真到现实的差距，并加强人机协作，特别是在人类参与循环的方法中。

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

models tool execution as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable
complexity. Using this dataset, we benchmark model performance and propose a
graph-based reward to enhance RLVR training. Experiments show that the dataset
presents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is
effective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance
of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

Motivation: 2019-2020年澳大利亚黑色夏季山火造成巨大破坏，凸显了改进火灾预测的紧迫性。传统火灾建模依赖人工解释和静态环境数据，存在准确性和操作性限制。

Method: 开发多模态火灾蔓延预测框架(MFiSP)，整合社交媒体数据和NASA FIRMS卫星影像等新兴数据源，通过燃料地图操作策略在数据同化周期间动态调整火灾行为预测。

Result: 使用合成生成的火灾事件多边形进行多场景评估，结果表明整合多模态数据的MFiSP能够超越依赖专家知识和静态输入的常规方法，改进火灾蔓延预测。

Conclusion: 多模态数据整合方法为火灾蔓延预测提供了更准确和动态的解决方案，有望改善火灾响应效果。

Abstract: The 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires in Australia devastated 19 million
hectares, destroyed 3,000 homes, and lasted seven months, demonstrating the
escalating scale and urgency of wildfire threats requiring better forecasting
for effective response. Traditional fire modeling relies on manual
interpretation by Fire Behaviour Analysts (FBAns) and static environmental
data, often leading to inaccuracies and operational limitations. Emerging data
sources, such as NASA's FIRMS satellite imagery and Volunteered Geographic
Information, offer potential improvements by enabling dynamic fire spread
prediction. This study proposes a Multimodal Fire Spread Prediction Framework
(MFiSP) that integrates social media data and remote sensing observations to
enhance forecast accuracy. By adapting fuel map manipulation strategies between
assimilation cycles, the framework dynamically adjusts fire behavior
predictions to align with the observed rate of spread. We evaluate the efficacy
of MFiSP using synthetically generated fire event polygons across multiple
scenarios, analyzing individual and combined impacts on forecast perimeters.
Results suggest that our MFiSP integrating multimodal data can improve fire
spread prediction beyond conventional methods reliant on FBAn expertise and
static inputs.

Motivation: 学者担忧基于LLM的应用会文化同质化和视角扁平化，本研究旨在实证检验在明确角色分配下，AI生成内容是否仍会趋同。

Method: 结合角色提示和相似性度量，使用OpenAI GPT、Google Gemini、Anthropic Claude和DeepSeek四个模型进行实验。

Result: 关于伊朗和中国的AI生成话语在四个模型中最同质且不变，尽管有角色视角变化和现实变化。

Conclusion: AI生成的政治话语存在同质化问题，特别是在中国和伊朗话题上，预训练模型固化了西方世界的政治术语，与现实变化脱节。

Abstract: Ask your chatbot to impersonate an expert from Russia and an expert from US
and query it on Chinese politics. How might the outputs differ? Or, to prepare
ourselves for the worse, how might they converge? Scholars have raised concerns
LLM based applications can homogenize cultures and flatten perspectives. But
exactly how much does LLM generated outputs converge despite explicit different
role assignment? This study provides empirical evidence to the above question.
The critique centres on pretrained models regurgitating ossified political
jargons used in the Western world when speaking about China, Iran, Russian, and
US politics, despite changes in these countries happening daily or hourly. The
experiments combine role-prompting and similarity metrics. The results show
that AI generated discourses from four models about Iran and China are the most
homogeneous and unchanging across all four models, including OpenAI GPT, Google
Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek, despite the prompted perspective change
and the actual changes in real life. This study does not engage with history,
politics, or literature as traditional disciplinary approaches would; instead,
it takes cues from international and area studies and offers insight on the
future trajectory of shifting political discourse in a digital space

Motivation: 将非结构化法律合同转换为机器可读格式对于自动化金融工作流程至关重要，但将复杂法律文档（如信用支持附件CSA）转换为CDM表示仍面临重大挑战

Method: 扩展CDMizer框架，采用模板驱动解决方案，确保在合同到CDM转换过程中的语法正确性和CDM模式遵从性

Result: CDMizer与显著更小的开源大型语言模型集成，在准确性和效率方面实现了与大型专有模型相竞争的性能

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了资源高效解决方案在自动化法律合同转换方面的潜力，为资源受限或有严格数据隐私要求的金融机构提供了成本效益高且可扩展的方法

Abstract: The transformation of unstructured legal contracts into standardized,
machine-readable formats is essential for automating financial workflows. The
Common Domain Model (CDM) provides a standardized framework for this purpose,
but converting complex legal documents like Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) into
CDM representations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
an extension of the CDMizer framework, a template-driven solution that ensures
syntactic correctness and adherence to the CDM schema during contract-to-CDM
conversion. We apply this extended framework to a real-world task, comparing
its performance with a benchmark developed by the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) for CSA clause extraction. Our results show that
CDMizer, when integrated with a significantly smaller, open-source Large
Language Model (LLM), achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and
efficiency against larger, proprietary models. This work underscores the
potential of resource-efficient solutions to automate legal contract
transformation, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach that can meet
the needs of financial institutions with constrained resources or strict data
privacy requirements.

Conclusion: DUET成功解决了预排序阶段表达性与效率的权衡问题，通过集合级预测和双模型协同训练实现了更好的推荐性能，并有效缓解了样本选择偏差。

Abstract: The pre-ranking stage plays a pivotal role in large-scale recommender systems
but faces an intrinsic trade-off between model expressiveness and computational
efficiency. Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints,
industry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are
computationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result,
they struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships
among candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent
and diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies
the Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on
biased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with
distinct distributions.
  To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DUET} (\textbf{DU}al Model
Co-Training for \textbf{E}ntire Space C\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise
pre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight
computational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs
set-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass,
enabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the
computational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism
extends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement,
effectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and
online A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
and achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics. At present,
DUET has been fully deployed in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite Apps, serving the
main traffic for hundreds of millions of users.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles on long, structured financial
filings where relevant evidence is sparse and cross-referenced. This paper
presents a systematic investigation of advanced metadata-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, proposing and evaluating a
novel, multi-stage RAG architecture that leverages LLM-generated metadata. We
introduce a sophisticated indexing pipeline to create contextually rich
document chunks and benchmark a spectrum of enhancements, including
pre-retrieval filtering, post-retrieval reranking, and enriched embeddings,
benchmarked on the FinanceBench dataset. Our results reveal that while a
powerful reranker is essential for precision, the most significant performance
gains come from embedding chunk metadata directly with text ("contextual
chunks"). Our proposed optimal architecture combines LLM-driven pre-retrieval
optimizations with these contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance.
Additionally, we present a custom metadata reranker that offers a compelling,
cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions, highlighting a practical
trade-off between peak performance and operational efficiency. This study
provides a blueprint for building robust, metadata-aware RAG systems for
financial document analysis.

Abstract: Most recommender systems treat timestamps as numeric or cyclical values,
overlooking real-world context such as holidays, events, and seasonal patterns.
We propose a scalable framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate geo-temporal embeddings from only a timestamp and coarse location,
capturing holidays, seasonal trends, and local/global events. We then introduce
a geo-temporal embedding informativeness test as a lightweight diagnostic,
demonstrating on MovieLens, LastFM, and a production dataset that these
embeddings provide predictive signal consistent with the outcomes of full model
integrations. Geo-temporal embeddings are incorporated into sequential models
through (1) direct feature fusion with metadata embeddings or (2) an auxiliary
loss that enforces semantic and geo-temporal alignment. Our findings highlight
the need for adaptive or hybrid recommendation strategies, and we release a
context-enriched MovieLens dataset to support future research.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的成功引发了对推荐系统是否也能获得类似扩展效益的思考。传统推荐系统在嵌入维度增长时趋于饱和，而生成式方法使用紧凑的语义ID序列，但工业部署多为专有，缺乏公开基准验证。

Method: 使用残差量化VAE生成语义ID，在Amazon Review数据集上对0.5B到7B参数的Qwen骨干网络进行后训练，包括监督微调和推荐导向的强化学习。

Result: 实验显示随着模型规模增大，训练和评估损失持续下降，验证了生成式方法的参数效率。轻量级后训练方法显著提高了排序准确性和候选多样性。

Conclusion: 生成式推荐方法确实存在扩展规律，通过语义ID和有效的后训练技术可以实现与传统方法竞争的性能，为开源推荐系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has renewed interest in
whether recommender systems can achieve similar scaling benefits. Conventional
recommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as
embedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm
replaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by
autoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain
proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected
scaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training
recipe that enables competitive performance?
  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully
open-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end
workflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and
recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual
Quantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
on the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward
trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,
validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further
enhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training
pipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies
reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together,
these techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and
candidate diversity.
