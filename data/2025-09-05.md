Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GFP框架，用高级特征预测替代传统低级坐标重建，实现高效骨架动作识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAE方法局限于原始关节坐标重建，导致计算冗余和语义表示有限

Method: 轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化监督信号，采用约束优化确保特征多样性

Result: 训练速度提升6.2倍，在NTU和PKU-MMD数据集上达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: 高级特征预测框架在计算效率和表示质量方面均优于传统方法

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 使用考生-老师模型通过像素级分割来解决有棒分裂图检测中的领域偏移和数据不平衡问题，统一框架同时处理检测和分类任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有棒分裂图计数耗时且观察者间存在差异，AI工具受领域偏移和数据不平衡影响，性能下降明显

Method: 基于UNet的考生-老师模型，集成对比表征学习和领域对抗训练，生成像素级偶伫掩码来提升特征区分性和稳健性

Result: 预测试验集上达到Track 1 F1分数0.7660，Track 2平衡准确率0.8414

Conclusion: 统一的分割基于检测和分类框架能够有效提高有棒分裂图分析的稳健性和准确性

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏差集成学习和梯度抑制微调来解决多偏差问题，在多个数据集上显著提升了最差组准确率并降低了偏差放大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多种重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别特征等），这些偏差共同损害视觉模型的性能和公平性，而单独处理每个偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧

Method: 1. 自适应偏差集成学习（ABIL）：为每个属性训练编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器显式识别偏差；2. 梯度抑制微调：从主干梯度中修剪偏差方向，留下忽略所有已知捷径的紧凑网络

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上提升了最差组准确率，将多属性偏差放大减半，并在Scaled Bias Amplification指标上达到新低

Conclusion: GMBM是第一个实用的端到端多偏差解决方案，能够有效处理视觉识别中的复杂偏差问题和分布偏移

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过细化分析nnU-Net的最佳组成部件，发现简单的affine增帽和深度监督是关键，开发了轻量级U-Net模型，在保持类似性能的同时大大缩小模型体积和提高速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心臂分割任务上表现良好，但模型过于繁重且速度慢，限制了实时应用。需要开发更轻量、更快速的模型以支持实时应用。

Method: 通过消融研究系统性地评估了数据增帽方案、网络结构修改、损失函数和后处理技术对性能的影响，识别出最有效的组成部件。

Result: 开发的轻量级U-Net模型（200万参数）与nnU-Net（3300万参数）在CAMUS数据集上表现统计等效（Dice指标0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89），模型大小减少16倍，速度提高4倍（1.35ms vs 5.40ms每帧）。在内部数据集上交叉验证显示了类似的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 简单的affine增帽和深度监督是心臂分割任务的关键因素，而复杂的增帽和大型模型并不能提供成比例的性能提升。这个轻量级模型为实时心臂分割应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

### [5] [treeX: Unsupervised Tree Instance Segmentation in Dense Forest Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03633)
*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于改进的treeX算法，提出一种无监督的资源高效树木分割方法，适用于地面和无人机等多种距离激光扫描数据，算法效率和准确性都有显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和计算资源，需要一种资源效率更高的无监督方法来处理森林3D点云数据并提取单木

Method: 改进的treeX算法，结合聚类基础的树干检测和区域生长的树冠划分方法，提供了地面扫描和无人机扫描两种参数预设

Result: 在6个公开数据集上评估，算法运行时间减少且准确性提升，地面数据F1分数提升0.11-0.49，无人机数据达到0.58F1分数，效果可与现有开源方法相比

Conclusion: 该方法作为深度学习的资源效率替代方案，同时可用于半自动生成深度学习标签，已开源提供Python实现

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D是一个创新的重建几何指令调优框架，通过引入几何感知监督来解决大型多模态模型在3D场景理解中的局限性，采用双监督范式在输入和目标层面同时利用3D几何信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖纯文本监督，缺乏学习稳健3D空间表示所需的几何约束，无法有效支持3D场景理解。

Method: 设计了互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，在双编码器架构中通过几何一致性约束来增强空间推理能力，采用几何信息作为输入和显式学习目标的双监督范式。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等多个基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅描述它们来实现有效的3D理解。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X是首个完全量化的多模态多智能体V2X协同感知系统，通过统一的端到端量化策略，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算和传输开销，系统延迟减少3.2倍，mAP30提升9.5。


<details>

Method: 提出QuantV2X系统，采用统一的端到端量化策略，同时对神经网络模型和传输消息表示进行量化，减少计算负载和传输带宽。

Result: 在低比特约束下达到与全精度系统相当的精度，系统级延迟降低3.2倍，mAP30提升9.5，能更有效地扩展模型规模以适应严格内存预算。

Conclusion: 完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中具有可行性，为V2X协同感知的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面图通常表示为图结构，图比较在搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用中至关重要。现有的图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢

Method: LayoutGKN采用延迟跨图节点级交互的策略，在联合嵌入架构的末端使用可微分图核作为最终学习到的节点级嵌入的距离函数

Result: LayoutGKN在相似性计算方面表现相当或优于图匹配网络，同时显著提高了速度

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图比较方法，通过架构优化在保持准确性的同时大幅提升推理效率，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种新颖的多模态参数高效适应技术，通过奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅需微调0.04%的参数即可实现领域适应，在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs适应方法依赖提示工程和完整模型微调，成本高且可能限制适应质量、破坏模型稳定性并损害预训练获得的知识。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)技术，仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量，实现领域适应而不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上实现最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下的准确性和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效的多模态适应方法，能够更好地保持模型的泛化能力，同时实现了可解释性分析。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但受光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特征影响，该任务研究不足且识别精度低。

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement(GAE)模块增强多尺度特征，Localization Guidance Branch(LGB)生成富含全局语义信息的位置图，Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder(MSSD)进行精确预测。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验表明，SLENet性能优于现有最先进方法，并显示出对更广泛COD任务的高泛化性。

Conclusion: SLENet框架有效解决了水下伪装目标检测的挑战，为海洋生态研究提供了有力的技术支撑，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

TL;DR: 通过利用视频序列的时间归纳偏置来改善图像滿散模型训练，加快收敛速度和提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像滿散模型仅基于独立采样的静态图像进行训练，这种方式在捐影时间信息方面有限，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖范围小和一般化能力下降

Method: 提出一种简单有效的训练策略，利用连续视频帧中的时间归纳偏置来改善滿散训练，无需修改网络结构，可无缝集成到标准滿散训练流程中

Result: 在HandCo数据集上评估，方法加速收敛速度超2倍以上，在训练和验证分布上都获得更低的FID指标，同时提升了生成的多样性

Conclusion: 通过流泰治规则化减小梯度方差，该方法能够有效利用时间归纳偏置来改善滿散模型的训练效果，实现更快的收敛和更好的生成质量

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像-文本对齐来解决放射学诊断中的漏读错误和沟通失败问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学诊断错误（漏读错误、注意力盲区和沟通失败）在临床实践中仍然普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中，医生需要检查数百个切片。现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足精确局部检测、全局体积级推理和语义一致的自然语言报告需求。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，进行局部和全局图像-文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习。通过语言模型重写和引入放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面达到最先进性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过创新的多尺度语义增强方法有效解决了3D放射学分析中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

TL;DR: CaPL是一种基于因果推理的视觉粒度化文本提示学习方法，通过属性解耦和粒度学习模块，显著提升了CLIP在细粒度数据集上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP提示学习方法在细粒度数据集上表现有限，需要一种能够捕捉细微类别差异的新方法。

Method: 提出两个模块：1) 属性解耦模块使用布朗桥扩散模型分解视觉特征；2) 粒度学习模块通过因果推理策略构建视觉粒度用于识别。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，CaPL方法显著优于最先进的提示学习方法，特别是在细粒度数据集上。

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL成功提升了CLIP在细粒度识别任务中的性能，为提示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于事件相机的激光融合氛流减缓方法(EGTM)，通过事件流的异步特性提取像素级的可靠无氛流指导，实现了比现有SOTA方法更高效的氛流减缓效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习氛流减缓方法需要高容量网络学习同步帧之间粗粒度的氛流动力学，计算和存储效率低。事件相机具有微秒级别的时间分辨率，可以根本解决这个瓶颈。

Method: 首先提出"事件幸运见解"揭示氛流异常与事件流逆时空分布的相关性，然后构建EGTM框架从噪声氛流事件中提取像素级可靠无氛流指导，进行时间幸运融合。还构建了首个真实世界事件驱动氛流数据集。

Result: 在真实世界EGTM数据集上，方法在恢复质量上达到SOTA（PSNR提升+0.94，SSIM提升+0.08），同时模型大小、推理延迟和模型复杂度分别减少了710倍、214倍和224倍，显示了极大的效率优势。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了将事件模态引入氛流减缓任务的重要价值，为高效氛流减缓提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-Event检测方法在处理两种模态的低信息区域时计算冗余严重，且固定阈值token选择方法无法适应不同复杂度样本的需求

Method: 提出事件引导多模态稀疏化(EGMS)策略识别并自适应丢弃低信息区域，设计跨模态聚焦融合(CMFF)模块有效整合互补特征

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上相比现有方法在精度和效率方面均取得更优性能

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效融合实现了RGB-Event检测任务中精度与效率的更好平衡

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: 传统食物识别方法无法处理新出现的菜品类别，需要零样本学习能力。组合零样本学习中的属性和对象与菜系和食材自然对应，但存在三个主要挑战

Method: SalientFusion方法包含两个组件：SalientFormer去除背景冗余并使用深度特征解决角色混淆；DebiasAT通过对齐提示与视觉特征减少语义偏差

Result: 在提出的CZSFood-90和CZSFood-164基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，同时在通用CZSL数据集上也表现优异

Conclusion: SalientFusion方法有效解决了CZSFR中的三个关键挑战，为零样本食物识别提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models

TL;DR: OccTENS是一个生成式占用世界模型，通过时间下一尺度预测任务和TensFormer架构，解决了传统自回归方法在效率、长期生成质量和可控性方面的不足，实现了高效、高质量、可控的长期3D占用生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归方法在3D占用世界建模中存在效率低下、长期生成时出现时间退化、缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种新的方法来同时解决这些挑战。

Method: 将占用世界模型重新表述为时间下一尺度预测(TENS)任务，将时间序列建模分解为空间尺度级生成和时间场景级预测。使用TensFormer架构管理时间因果关系和空间关系，并提出整体姿态聚合策略实现统一序列建模。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的TENS任务分解和TensFormer架构，成功解决了3D占用生成中的效率、质量和可控性问题，为占用世界建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别物体间建立密集对应关系对形状重建和机器人操作等任务很重要。物体功能（对其他物体的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性

Method: 利用视觉语言模型为多视角图像伪标注功能部件，结合密集对比学习从像素对应关系中提取功能和空间知识，训练新模型建立密集功能对应

Result: 构建了合成和真实评估数据集作为任务基准，实验结果表明该方法优于基于现成自监督图像表示和接地视觉语言模型的基线解决方案

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉语言模型的伪标注和密集对比学习，成功建立了跨类别的密集功能对应关系，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调特异性，在保持与人类判断高度相关的同时大幅提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像描述评估指标存在诸多问题：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，表示相似性指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，而基于大语言模型的指标虽然相关性好但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代使用。

Method: SPECS通过修改CLIP模型的目标函数来增强特异性，奖励正确的细节描述并惩罚错误的描述，从而构建一个既高效又与人类判断高度相关的无参考评估指标。

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM-based指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，使其成为图像描述模型开发中迭代检查点评估的实用替代方案。

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个计算高效且与人类判断高度相关的评估方案，解决了长图像描述任务中现有评估指标的局限性，特别适合模型开发过程中的迭代评估使用。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

*Xihua Sheng,Yingwen Zhang,Long Xu,Shiqi Wang*

TL;DR: 提出端到端学习型多视角视频编码框架LMVC，通过利用独立视角的运动和内容信息来增强依赖视角压缩，显著优于传统MV-HEVC标准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频是体视频的关键数据源，但数据量巨大导致存储和传输挑战。现有深度学习视频编码主要关注单视角或立体视频，多视角场景研究不足

Method: 提出基于特征的视角间运动矢量预测方法，利用解码的独立视角运动特征；提出无视差的视角间上下文预测模块，从独立视角内容特征预测上下文；配合视角间运动熵模型和上下文熵模型

Result: 实验结果表明LMVC框架大幅优于传统MV-HEVC标准参考软件

Conclusion: 该框架为多视角视频编码领域建立了强有力的基准，支持随机访问和向后兼容性

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑优化的框架，通过整体建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程精炼方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构的几何和拓扑重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖体素重叠度量，无法捕捉拓扑正确性和完整性，而拓扑感知损失和持续同调约束通常只能局部应用，无法保证全局保持或推理时的几何错误修正。

Method: 采用整体区域建模策略捕捉完整空间上下文；引入拓扑完整性Betti约束联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；使用持续同调的课程精炼方案从粗到细逐步修正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上，β₀错误分别从69.00降至3.40和从1.65降至0.30，树长度检测和分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效修正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ANTS方法，利用多模态大语言模型构建自适应负文本空间，通过生成表达性负句子来精确描述OOD分布，提升远距离和近距离OOD检测性能，在ImageNet基准上FPR95降低4.2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假负标签会显著降低近距离OOD性能

Method: 利用MLLMs的理解和推理能力：1）识别可能OOD样本生成表达性负句子；2）针对近OOD设置，识别视觉相似的ID类别子集并生成定制化负标签；3）设计自适应加权分数平衡两种负文本空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95达4.2%，建立新的最先进水平，方法无需训练且零样本，具有高可扩展性

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过MLLMs构建自适应负文本空间，有效解决了OOD检测中负空间构建不准确和假负标签问题，在远距离和近距离OOD检测中都表现出优异性能

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

TL;DR: MMChange是一个多模态遥感变化检测方法，结合图像和文本模态，通过图像特征细化、文本差异增强和跨模态融合模块，显著提升了变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法仅依赖图像模态，在特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力方面存在局限，特别是在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳。

Method: 提出多模态RSCD方法MMChange：1）图像特征细化模块突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；2）使用视觉语言模型生成双时相图像的语义描述；3）文本差异增强模块捕获细粒度语义变化；4）图像-文本特征融合模块实现深度跨模态集成。

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMChange通过多模态融合有效提升了遥感变化检测的性能，验证了其在多模态RSCD中的有效性。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: SAC-MIL是一种用于WSI分类的空间感知相关多实例学习方法，通过位置编码和全实例相关性处理，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WSI分类中空间信息利用不足和计算复杂度高的问题，特别是Transformer方法需要定制CUDA内核的部署困难

Method: 包含位置编码模块（利用实例坐标编码空间关系）和SAC块（基于MLP的全实例相关性计算，线性时间复杂度）

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SAC-MIL通过简单有效的MLP结构实现了高效的空间感知WSI分类，解决了长度外推问题且易于部署

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 肝脏MRI血管分割对分析血管重塑很重要，但现有方法依赖对比增强成像数据，而无对比剂图像更常见但分割困难且需要大量标注数据

Method: 多任务学习框架，利用训练时配对的对比增强和原生MRI数据（有/无血管标注）进行模型训练，通过共享任务结构改善特征表示

Result: 辅助数据提高了血管分割准确性，即使推理时不可用；在标注数据较少时优势最明显；该方法在脑肿瘤分割验证中也显示跨领域优势

Conclusion: 即使仅在训练时可用，辅助信息成像模态也能增强专家标注的效果，减少对大规模标注数据的依赖

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答任务中，即使提示词微小变化也会导致高达15%的准确率差异，提出了Promptception框架系统评估提示词敏感性，并为专有和开源模型制定了不同的提示原则。

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统研究，现有评估存在不公平性，因为模型通常使用精心挑选的提示词来报告最佳性能。

Method: 提出了Promptception框架，包含61种提示类型，涵盖15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个不同规模的大型多模态模型在3个多项选择题基准测试上的表现。

Result: 发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感但性能更好，开源模型更稳定但处理复杂提示词能力较弱。提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对不同类型模型制定差异化的提示原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估，提升大型多模态模型评估的透明度和可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有3D语义占据预测方法在处理体素特征时忽视高度轴信息，传统通道注意力对所有高度层赋予相同权重，限制了不同高度特征的表征能力

Method: 使用全局和局部垂直切片提取体素特征，通过全局局部融合模块协调细节与上下文信息，提出SEAttention3D模块保持高度分辨率并为每个高度层分配动态通道注意力权重

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc框架通过有效利用高度维度信息，显著提升了3D语义占据预测的性能，特别是在小物体检测方面表现突出

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: LML问题在实际应用中具有重要价值，提出的计数网络和MPEM模块能够有效提升分类性能，尤其是对于多数类比例高的包。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机监控和国产芯片应用提供了创新解决方案，成功解决了传统视频监控系统的实时性瓶颈问题

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角特征融合有效减少视角偏差，无需模型微调或额外标注，适用于大规模数据集，在准确性和效率方面都取得了显著成效

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结合双向文本融合(BiT)模块和类别感知时序图(CATS)模块的方法，解决音频-视觉视频解析任务中伪标签噪声传播问题，在多个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个问题：一是将噪声片段级伪标签视为可靠监督，二是让无差别的注意力将伪标签传播到所有帧，导致初始误差在训练中被反复放大

Method: 通过BiT模块对音频和视觉模态特征进行语义注入和动态校准，定位和净化更干净丰富的语义线索；利用CATS模块进行语义传播和连接，实现跨时间的精确语义信息传播

Result: 在两个基准数据集LLP和UnAV-100上的多个关键指标上达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合了先前两个研究方向的优势，通过语义净化和精确传播解决了伪标签噪声问题，显著提升了音频-视觉视频解析的性能

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在角色一致性和对话渲染方面存在困难，导致伪影生成和故事叙述不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成逐帧描述、角色细节和对话，采用基于边界注意力的每框掩码技术控制角色交互，应用身份一致的自注意力机制确保角色一致性，以及区域感知交叉注意力进行精确对象放置。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多角色故事可视化中的角色一致性和对话分配问题，提升了故事生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂多元素提示时表现不佳，且风格多样性有限，需要一种能够精确解析空间位置和风格指令，并支持多专家协同生成的解决方案。

Method: 提出MEPG框架，包含两个核心组件：1）PSA模块使用监督微调的LLM将输入提示分解为精确空间坐标和风格编码的语义指令；2）MED模块通过动态专家路由在局部区域和全局区域实现跨区域生成，使用基于注意力的门控机制选择激活专家模型。

Result: 实验表明MEPG在相同骨干网络下显著优于基线模型，在图像质量和风格多样性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: MEPG框架通过整合位置-风格感知LLM和多专家扩散模块，有效解决了复杂多元素提示生成问题，提供了强大的可扩展性和实时交互编辑能力，为文本到图像生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测研究多基于高度控制数据集，需要在野外环境中评估检测器的实际性能，并提供可访的解决方案

Method: 重新调整Ojha等人提出的基于预训练视觉背榜的方法，通过更优的超参数调整来提高模型在Deepfake-Eval-2024野外数据集上的表现

Conclusion: 简单的预训练视觉背榜等方法通过谨慎的超参数调整可以在野外环境中实现高性能深度伪造检测，为实际部署提供了在准确性、计算成本和可解释性之间的平衡选择

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Method: 提出一种集成方法，将通用的YOLOv8模型与专门的热成像模型相结合，使用精细的盒融合算法来结合它们的预测结果

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法达到了mAP@.5为0.93和F1分数为0.90，超过了独立YOLOv8模型的mAP@.5 0.91成绩

Conclusion: 结果证明，结合多种YOLO架构和融合多谱数据提供了更可靠的解决方案，显著改善了可见光和热成像缺陷的检测能力

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像标注工具需要大量人工输入，限制了大规模数据集的可扩展性。为了解决这个问题，需要开发AI辅助的自动化标注工具来提高效率。

Method: 集成CLIP与预训练检测器（如Ultralytics模型）和零样本模型（如Grounding DINO），使用低置信度阈值生成初始标注，并通过交互式工具进行精炼，支持边界框、定向边界框和多边形标注。

Result: 在COCO类数据集上测试显示，初始预测大部分正确，手动工作量减少高达90%，同时通过聚类和IoU图保持高标注精度。

Conclusion: VisioFirm通过AI辅助自动化显著提高了图像标注效率，支持多种导出格式和离线操作，是一个高效且易用的标注解决方案。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UCIR方法在整个图像层面进行跨域特征对齐，往往难以处理域间差异，因为关键的对象特征经常与域特定风格纠缠在一起。

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型进行特征解缠，分离对象特征和域特定风格；采用渐进式跨域邻居对齐策略，从域内到跨域逐步对齐解缠后的对象特征。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的13个域中取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进式对齐有效解决了跨域图像检索中的域差异问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Conclusion: LASER框架有效提升了VLM在多步感知和坐标预测方面的能力，为复杂视觉语言任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Conclusion: 混合DMP架构能够有效提升遥感图像语义分割性能，通过融合RGB和DMP特征，为模型提供更好的形状信息，从而在多个评估指标上实现性能提升。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该自监督框架为关节对象表示学习提供了更灵活的解决方案，在输入要求更少的情况下仍能达到优异性能

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

TL;DR: 使用文本生成图像模型的合成图像作为可靠参考点，识别和缩正图像分类数据集中的误标签样本，提升在语义噪声条件下的分类准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类数据集中的语义噪声（视觉相似类别被误标签）给传统监督学习带来重大挑战，需要有效方法来处理这种噪声问题

Method: 提出一种新题方法：利用高质量合成图像作为可靠参考点，识别和缩正噪声数据集中的误标签样本，而非直接用于训练

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行了大量实验，显示该方法在各种噪声条件下显著提高了分类准确性，尤其在具有语义标签噪声的具有挑战性场景中

Conclusion: 该方法与现有噪声精强学习技术正交，组合时能达到更优的性能：在CIFAR-10上在70%语义噪声下提高30%准确性，在CIFAR-100上提高11%，在ImageNet-100实际噪声条件下提高24%

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的高效模型成功解决了odd-one-out异常检测任务的挑战，为实际应用提供了更可行的解决方案，同时为多模态大语言模型在该领域的性能评估提供了基准。

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning

TL;DR: GeoArena是一个评估大型视觉语言模型图像地理定位能力的开放平台，解决了现有评估方法的数据泄露和隐私问题，通过真实野外图像和人类判断进行更准确的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像地理定位评估存在两个主要问题：1）数据泄露 - 大型视觉语言模型在测试数据集上预训练，影响评估准确性；2）现有指标过度依赖精确坐标，忽视推理过程并引发隐私担忧。

Method: 开发GeoArena平台，允许用户上传真实野外图像构建多样化评估语料库，利用成对人类判断来确定哪个模型输出更符合人类期望，收集数千条投票记录进行分析。

Result: 平台已在线部署两个月，建立了不同大型视觉语言模型在图像地理定位任务上的排行榜，提供了基于人类判断的评估数据。

Conclusion: GeoArena为全球图像地理定位任务提供了首个开放评估平台，实现了真正野外环境和以人为中心的基准测试，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E框架首次将基于Diffusion Transformer的先进编辑模型应用于密集几何预测，通过重新制定训练目标和量化策略，在零样本深度和法线估计任务中取得了显著性能提升

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像的任务，编辑模型比文本到图像生成模型更适合作为微调基础。研究发现编辑模型具有内在结构先验，能更稳定地收敛并达到更高性能

Method: 提出FE2E框架，将编辑模型的流匹配损失重新制定为"一致速度"训练目标，使用对数量化解决精度冲突，利用DiT的全局注意力实现深度和法线的联合估计

Result: 在没有扩大训练数据的情况下，在多个数据集的零样本单目深度和法线估计中取得显著性能提升，在ETH3D数据集上获得超过35%的性能增益，优于使用100倍数据训练的DepthAnything系列

Conclusion: 编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何估计任务，FE2E框架通过有效的训练策略和架构优势，在零样本设置下实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Conclusion: MICACL框架有效解决了动态面部表情识别中的关键挑战，通过创新的时空建模和对比学习策略显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: 该方法为应急响应场景提供了一种高效的视觉摘要解决方案，通过将长时间视频转换为简洁全景图像，显著提升了情况感知和决策效率

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Motivation: 随着公共安全需求增长，需要通过自然语言描述检索具有异常行为的个体。传统方法面临细粒度跨模态对齐和实际样本稀疏两大挑战，而大型多模态模型在这一领域潜力未充分发挥。

Method: 提出AnomalyLMM框架，包括：(1)从粗细粒度到细粒度的流水线，将生成式知识与检索式异常检测相结合；(2)无需训练的适配方法，包括掩码跨模态提示、行为显著性预测和知识感知重排序。

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM成为首个利用LMMs进行文本基于人员异常检索的框架，有效解决了细粒度对齐和样本稀疏问题，为该领域研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在美学图片描述任务中尚未专门适配以关注美学内容，主要集中在美学评分预测

Method: 提出ASE-MLLM框架，包含图片美学显著性模块(IASM)高效提取美学特征，通过IAS-ViT编码器使用交叉注意力机制融合美学特征和原始图片特征

Result: 在主流美学图片描述评测集上显著超过传统方法和通用MLLMs，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个专门为美学图片描述设计的框架，通过显式融入图片美学显著性显著提升了描述质量

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Motivation: 解决现有3D风格转换方法在提取高级风格语义和保持结构清晰度方面的不足，使得风格化结果难以区分不同实例或物体。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的3D风格转换管线能够生成结构更清晰、视觉更一致、艺术效果更丰富的风格化结果，有效解决了现有方法的主要限制。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Motivation: X射线叠层成像在纳米尺度分辨率方面具有优势，但在探针未知的情况下准确重建图像仍是一个关键挑战。传统迭代方法和深度学习方法在低剂量高速实验的低信号条件下往往效果不佳，限制了该技术的广泛应用。

Method: 提出了Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR)自监督框架，将物体和探针都参数化为连续的神经表示，直接从原始衍射图案进行端到端重建，无需任何探针预表征。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上均实现了卓越的重建质量，在具有挑战性的低信号条件下表现出显著的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用、物理信息驱动的框架，可用于解决探针依赖的逆问题，适用于广泛的计算显微镜问题。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Motivation: 现有流基3D生成模型需要数十个采样步骤，尽管Consistency Models在2D模型加速方面取得进展，但在更复杂的3D生成任务中仍然研究不足

Method: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching(VM)和Velocity Distillation(VD)两种可优化目标，将转运层面的优化目标转换为速度层和分布层的等价优化

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上将每个流变换器的采样步数从25步降到1-2步，实现0.68s(1步x2)和0.94s(2步x2)延迟，速度提升9.0x和6.5x，保持高视觉和几何保真度

Conclusion: 该方法显著超过现有CM蓄粉方法，使TRELLIS在少步骤3D生成中达到优异性能

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的X射线图像准直器阴影分割方法，通过可微霍夫变换网络检测准直边界并增强ROI中心信息提取，实现几何约束的精确分割


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线成像中的准直限制曝光区域并最小化患者辐射剂量，但散射辐射会使准直器阴影边缘模糊，传统检测方法面临挑战

Method: 提出结合可微霍夫变换的深度学习分割网络，同时检测准直边界和提取ROI中心信息，在推理时整合两个任务的信息生成线约束的精细化分割掩码

Result: 在真实X射线图像测试集上实现了稳健的准直区域重建，中位Hausdorff距离达到4.3-5.0mm

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理最多四个阴影边界的情况，且不受特定边数限制，为准直器阴影检测提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了UCF-UM框架，通过周期性评估协议来量化统一模型在视觉理解和生成任务中的语义潮淀问题，并开发了三个新的评估指标来评估模型的交叉模态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法将视觉理解和生成能力分离考虑，无法反映模型在多次交互中的语义保持能力。需要一种新的评估框架来评估统一模型在语义一致性方面的表现。

Method: 提出UCF-UM周期性评估协议，通过多轮次在图像到文本和文本到图像之间切换来测量语义潮淀。开发了三个指标：平均累积潮淀(MCD)、语义潮淀率(SDR)和多代生成评估(MGG)。构建了ND400新标准数据集来进行测试。

Result: 对七个最新模型进行评测，发现不同模型在交叉模态稳定性上存在显著差异。BAGEL模型能够在多次交互中保持语义一致性，而Vila-u模型虽然单次评测成绩优秀但语义潮淀快速。

Conclusion: 周期一致性评估是对标准I2T和T2I评测的必要补充，UCF-UM框架提供了实用的指标来系统评估统一模型的交叉模态稳定性和共享表征的强度。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Motivation: 全景图像在虚拟现实、自主驾驶等领域需求增长，但其与透视图像在几何投影、空间分布等方面存在显著差异，直接域适配面临挑战。

Method: 首先回顾全景成像流程和投影方法，分析结构差异；总结三大域适配挑战：极点附近严重几何形变、等距站投影的非均匀采样、周期边界连续性；从跨方法和跨任务两个维度分析代表性策略。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了数据、模型和应用方面的开放挑战和未来方向，为全景视觉技术的发展提供了新的见解和前瞻性观点。

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Method: 提出了Plot'n Polish零样本框架，能够在不同细节级别上对故事可视化进行细粒度控制，支持一致的故事生成和修改。

Result: 该框架能够实现一致的故事可视化生成，提供fine和coarse级别的编辑能力，同时保持跨多帧的视觉和叙事一致性。

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish解决了现有方法在故事可视化中缺乏灵活性和一致性的问题，为创作者提供了无缝制作和精炼视觉故事的能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Motivation: 多模态虚假信息（包含文本、视觉和跨模态失真）对社会构成日益严重的威胁，现有方法通常只关注单一失真类型且难以泛化到未见场景。

Method: 提出TRUST-VL模型，包含新颖的Question-Aware Visual Amplifier模块提取任务特定视觉特征，并使用TRUST-Instruct大规模指令数据集（198K样本）进行训练，该数据集包含与人类事实核查工作流程对齐的结构化推理链。

Conclusion: 联合训练不同类型失真有助于知识共享，TRUST-VL为多模态虚假信息检测提供了一个有效且可解释的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿视频生成需要大量计算资源和长视频数据，且难以生成任意长度的视频。VFR旨在解决这些限制，实现高效、灵活的长视频生成。

Method: 采用分段自回归生成方法，使用前缀视频条件确保局部平滑性，通过360度锚点视频保持全局时间一致性，无需大量计算资源。

Result: 成功生成了分钟级别的虚拟试穿视频，在各种动作下都保持了局部平滑和全局时间一致性，成为长虚拟试穿视频生成的先驱工作。

Conclusion: VFR框架为长视频生成提供了新的解决方案，通过创新的分段生成方法和一致性保持机制，实现了高质量、任意长度的虚拟试穿视频生成。

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统需要在最大化主要目标的同时确保次要目标满足最低阈值约束，但手动调整超参数来维持这些约束在系统变化时很困难

Method: 提出自动化约束目标(ACT)框架，使用离线无偏数据的成对评估来寻找解决方案，并持续重训练以适应系统和用户行为变化

Result: 实证证明了ACT框架的有效性，并描述了在大规模生产环境中的部署情况

Conclusion: ACT框架能够自动有效地解决推荐系统中的约束条件维护问题，适应系统变化并减少手动调参需求

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

Motivation: 定位置偏巾对推荐系统的负面影响，传统的逆倾向概率评分(IPS)方法在复杂布局中偏向估计准确性低

Method: 提出使用大语言模型(LLMs)应用于日志用户交互数据来估计位置偏巾，通过LLM-as-a-judge方法更准确地估计偏向概率

Result: 新方法估算的偏向值在不同分数段中表现稳定，能够反映Viator网格布局的行列效应，使用IPS重权的重排模型在NDCG@10上与生产模型相当同时提升weighted NDCG@10约2%

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-judge方法提供了一种成本效益高的偏向估计方案，能够有效减少位置偏巾对推荐系统的影响，并将在实际流量实验中验证

Abstract: Recommender and search systems commonly rely on Learning To Rank models
trained on logged user interactions to order items by predicted relevance.
However, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are
more likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of
their actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and
reinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving
relevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity
Scoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a
propensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given
position is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging,
especially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models
(LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a
cost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that
propensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score
buckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler
heuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities
matches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted
NDCG@10 by roughly 2%. We will verify these offline gains in forthcoming
live-traffic experiments.

Method: 提出简单但高效的训练和推理修改方法，实现商品的单元词表示和单步解码机制。

Result: 在Amazon购物数据集上，推荐质量（Recall和NDCG）超过现有技术，同时推理效率提高5-14倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM基于推荐系统提供了效率优化的新视角，开启了将ID集成到LLM中的新研究方向。

Abstract: Integrating product catalogs and user behavior into LLMs can enhance
recommendations with broad world knowledge, but the scale of real-world item
catalogs, often containing millions of discrete item identifiers (Item IDs),
poses a significant challenge. This contrasts with the smaller, tokenized text
vocabularies typically used in LLMs. The predominant view within the LLM-based
recommendation literature is that it is infeasible to treat item ids as a first
class citizen in the LLM and instead some sort of tokenization of an item into
multiple tokens is required. However, this creates a key practical bottleneck
in serving these models for real-time low-latency applications.
  Our paper challenges this predominant practice and integrates item ids as
first class citizens into the LLM. We provide simple, yet highly effective,
novel training and inference modifications that enable single-token
representations of items and single-step decoding. Our method shows
improvements in recommendation quality (Recall and NDCG) over existing
techniques on the Amazon shopping datasets while significantly improving
inference efficiency by 5x-14x. Our work offers an efficiency perspective
distinct from that of other popular approaches within LLM-based recommendation,
potentially inspiring further research and opening up a new direction for
integrating IDs into LLMs. Our code is available here

Conclusion: LLM自动化评估方法能够有效替代人工标注，提高搜索相关性评估的效率和规模，带来更高质量的相关性指标

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum
Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

Motivation: 虽然RAG系统能够通过提供检索到的证据来减少大语言模型的幻觉，但这种设计也引入了潜在漏洞：LLM可能吸收和复制检索到的错误信息。在健康领域，错误响应可能造成严重害备，因此需要重点关注该领域的RAG系统安全性。

Method: 采用控制实验方法，使用常见健康问题，逐步变化检索到的文档类型和组成（有帮助的、有害的和对抗性的），以及用户提问的框架方式（一致的、中立的和不一致的），评估模型输出与真实答案的一致性。

Result: 对抗性文档显著降低了模型输出与真实答案的一致性，但当检索池中同时包含有帮助的证据时，系统的稳健性可以得以保持。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在高风险领域设计更安全的RAG系统提供了可操作的见解，强调了对检索安全保障措施的需求。所有实验结果都公开提供以便复现和促进未来研究。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github

Motivation: 解决传统NER需要预定义实体类型的问题，支持用户自定义开放类型描述来检索相关实体，实现无模式化的实体检索。

Method: 利用LLM中间层transformer块的值向量作为内部表示，训练轻量级对比投影网络对齐类型兼容实体，分离不相关类型，生成紧凑的类型感知实体嵌入。

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding
models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential
contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To
further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for
efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product
development workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户兴趣的动态演化和互联网应用中对多模态需求的增长，基于静态兴趣偏好的个性化内容生成策略难以满足实际应用需求

Method: TIMGen模型建模用户兴趣的长期时序演化，捕捉具有强时序依赖性的动态兴趣表示，支持文本、图像、视频和音频等多模态特征融合，联合学习时序依赖和模态偏好以获得统一的兴趣表示

Result: 该模型能够灵活动态地建模用户的多模态兴趣，更好地理解和捕捉用户的兴趣偏好，克服了基于静态偏好的个性化内容推荐方法的缺点

Conclusion: TIMGen模型可扩展到电子商务、广告、在线教育和精准医疗等多种实际应用场景，为未来研究提供了启示

Abstract: With the dynamic evolution of user interests and the increasing multimodal
demands in internet applications, personalized content generation strategies
based on static interest preferences struggle to meet practical application
requirements. The proposed TIMGen (Temporal Interest-driven Multimodal
Generation) model addresses this challenge by modeling the long-term temporal
evolution of users' interests and capturing dynamic interest representations
with strong temporal dependencies. This model also supports the fusion of
multimodal features, such as text, images, video, and audio, and delivers
customized content based on multimodal preferences. TIMGen jointly learns
temporal dependencies and modal preferences to obtain a unified interest
representation, which it then generates to meet users' personalized content
needs. TIMGen overcomes the shortcomings of personalized content recommendation
methods based on static preferences, enabling flexible and dynamic modeling of
users' multimodal interests, better understanding and capturing their interests
and preferences. It can be extended to a variety of practical application
scenarios, including e-commerce, advertising, online education, and precision
medicine, providing insights for future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,
resulting in significant gains in online metrics.

Motivation: 传统的全局到本地检索范式存在计算成本高的问题，而新兴的高效本地特征搜索技术为改变这种范式提供了可能性。

Result: 在Revisited Oxford和Paris数据集上达到了新的状态下最佳结果，显示了坚固的检索性能。

Conclusion: 本地到全局检索范式通过结合高效的本地特征搜索和有效的全局特征重排序，能够实现更好的图像检索性能。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了大型语言模型的人格特征，发现指令对齐能稳定特质表达但自报特质无法可靠预测行为，角色注入能改变自报特质但对实际行为影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs是否表现出类似人类的人格特质模式，此前研究主要依赖简化的自我报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证。

Method: 从三个维度系统表征LLM人格：(1)训练阶段特质配置的动态演变；(2)自报特质在行为任务中的预测效度；(3)角色注入等干预措施对自报特质和行为的影响。

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定特质表达并增强特质相关性，但自报特质无法可靠预测行为，且与人类模式存在差异。角色注入能成功引导自报特质但对实际行为影响有限或不一致。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，强调需要区分表面特质表达与行为一致性，在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深层次的评估。

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Conclusion: 通过将序列操作转换为图结构表征，并结合RAG技术，PG-Agent能够更好地理解GUI环境的结构特征，提高在未见场景下的演续性和演继性。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Conclusion: 该研究为准马尔可夫因果模型中的部分可识别查询提供了有效的概率边界计算方法，列生成技术的应用展示了在处理此类问题时的优越性能，为因果推理中的不确定性量化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

Conclusion: 扩散概率模型为安全关键型冲突解决任务提供了有效的多模态决策能力，使智能体能够灵活切换到有效的替代机动策略，实现了性能的显著飞跃。

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

Result: 识别出CNS是人类独有的生物构造，无法被模拟或制造，这使人类在道德和领导能力方面保持独特优势。

Conclusion: 即使AI在技术能力方面超越人类，DNA基因基础的生命体验仍然是领导宇宙的最佳基础，而非硅晶芯片。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

Motivation: 现有方法如ReAct要求LLM在每个动作前都进行规划，这在计算上昂贵且会降低长时程任务的性能，而完全不规划又会限制性能表现。

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1）在多样化合成数据上进行监督微调，为动态规划做准备；2）在长时程环境中使用强化学习来精炼这种能力

Result: 在Crafter环境中的实验表明，动态规划智能体样本效率更高，能持续实现更复杂的目标，并且可以通过人类编写的规划有效引导，超越其独立能力

Conclusion: 这是首个探索训练LLM智能体进行动态测试时计算分配的研究，为更高效、自适应和可控的智能体系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保持模型有效性的同时提高可解释性，促进机器学习技术的透明度和可信度

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in

Method: 使用提示工程为LLM代理注入不同人格原型，基于MBTI的认知和情感两个基本轴来控制行为，并整合16Personalities测试进行自动化验证

Result: 人格条件化在不同任务中产生一致、可解释的行为偏差：情感表达型代理在叙事生成中表现优异，分析型代理在博弈论设置中采用更稳定策略，自我反思能改善合作和推理质量

Conclusion: 该方法为无需微调的心理增强AI代理奠定了基础，可推广到Big Five、HEXACO等其他心理学框架，建立了心理学理论与LLM行为设计的桥梁

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with

TL;DR: 基于图像模式的神经符号系统Embodied-LM，通过射体认知结构提升大语言模型的逻辑推理能力和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面存在错误，缺乏像人类一样的健壮心智表征

Method: 基于图像模式构建原型系统，使用声明式空间推理和答案集编程形式化认知结构

Result: 在逻辑执推问题上证明，系统能够指导LLMs通过射体认知结构解释场景，并支持更有效的逻辑推理

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现仅聚焦空间原语，但为深入深度动态表征的集成奠定了计算基础

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文揭示了强化学习提升大语言模型推理能力的机制，发现推理层次结构的涌现现象，并提出HICRA算法专注于规划令牌优化，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习能有效提升大语言模型的复杂推理能力，但其成功背后的机制仍不明确，需要深入理解RL训练过程中的关键动态和瓶颈。

Method: 通过分析RL训练过程中的现象，提出HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)算法，该算法专注于高影响力的规划令牌优化，并使用语义熵作为战略探索的衡量指标。

Result: HICRA算法显著优于强基线方法，证明专注于战略瓶颈是解锁高级推理能力的关键，语义熵被验证为比令牌级熵更有效的战略探索衡量指标。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RL训练中推理层次结构的涌现机制，提出的层次感知信用分配方法能更高效地提升模型推理能力，为理解和发展更有效的RL算法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

TL;DR: 时间序列分类中SHAP解释性方法的计算复杂度问题，通过分段策略提高效率，研究发现分段数量比分段算法更重要，等长分段效果最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SHAP在长时间序列中计算复杂度高的问题，通过分段策略提高解释效率，但最优分段策略仍不明确

Method: 研究8种不同的时间序列分段算法，使用InterpretTime和AUC Difference两种评估方法，在单复变量时间序列上进行实验

Result: 分段数量对解释质量的影响比分段算法更大，等长分段策略表现最佳，新提出的按长度权重归一化技术能持续提高归因质量

Conclusion: 等长分段是最简单有效的SHAP加速方法，分段数量的选择比分段算法更关键，新的归一化方法能进一步改善解释效果

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

*Wesley Hanwen Deng,Sunnie S. Y. Kim,Akshita Jha,Ken Holstein,Motahhare Eslami,Lauren Wilcox,Leon A Gatys*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 人格化红队测试方法PersonaTeaming，通过在对手提示生成中结合不同人设，显著提高了AI模型的攻击成功率，同时保持提示多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化红队测试方法忽视了人员身份和背景对测试策略的影响，需要研究如何将人身份因素结合到自动化测试中。

Method: 提出PersonaTeaming方法：1）基于"红队专家"和"普通用户"人设进行提示突变；2）动态人设生成算法，自适应不同种子提示；3）开发新指标测量突变距离。

Result: 实验结果显示，人设突变方法在保持提示多样性的同时，将攻击成功率提高了最高达144.1%，超过了最先进的RainbowPlus方法。

Conclusion: 人设化红队测试能够有效提高AI风险检测效果，为自动化与人工红队测试的补充组合揭示了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在作为人类研究替代品时存在内部不一致性问题，尽管能生成类似人类的回答，但缺乏行为一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM生成代理是否能够真正替代真实人类参与者进行研究，关注其内部一致性而非仅表面回答的相似性。

Method: 设计实验研究来(a)揭示代理的内部状态，(b)在基本对话设置中检查代理行为，通过行为假设测试一致性。

Result: 发现不同模型家族和规模的LLM都存在显著的内部不一致性，无法保持行为一致性。

Conclusion: LLM代理虽然能生成类似人类的回答，但由于缺乏内部一致性，无法准确替代真实人类研究参与者。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

TL;DR: RAGuard是一个增强的RAG框架，通过并行查询技术文档和安全文档，在海上风电维护中显著提升安全召回率从接近0%到50%以上，同时保持技术召回率在60%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大型语言模型在高度专业化或意外场景中经常失败，海上风电维护对准确性和安全性要求极高，需要确保技术深度和安全覆盖。

Method: 提出RAGuard框架，通过并行查询两个索引（技术手册和安全关键文档），为知识和安全分配单独的检索预算；开发SafetyClamp扩展，获取更大的候选池并进行硬钳位处理。

Result: 在稀疏、密集和混合检索范式中评估，安全召回率从RAG的几乎0%提升到RAGuard的50%以上，技术召回率保持在60%以上。

Conclusion: RAGuard和SafetyClamp有潜力为关键维护环境中LLM驱动的决策支持建立安全保证的新标准。

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统使用固定的协作协议，忽视了智能体内部的审议能力，将智能体视为被动执行者而无法根据内部认知状态（如不确定性或置信度）调整策略

Method: 引入MPDF框架，智能体学习对高级元认知行动（Persist、Refine、Concede）的去中心化策略；开发SoftRankPO强化学习算法，通过基于平滑正态分位数映射的奖励排名来塑造优势函数，稳定训练过程

Result: 在五个数学和通用推理基准测试中，MPDF与SoftRankPO相比六种最先进的启发式和基于学习的多智能体推理算法，实现了4-5%的绝对平均准确率提升

Conclusion: 这项工作为多智能体LLM系统提供了学习自适应、元认知策略的范式，将重点从设计固定协议转向学习动态的、审议性策略

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs在社会政策制定中展现出应用前景，但需要与领域专家合作建立适当的保障措施和情境调整机制

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

Motivation: OMOP CDM数据标准化过程中，源医学术语向标准概念的映射工作资源浪费且容易出错，而大语言模型存在幽灵问题不适合直接于临床部署

Method: 基于Model Context Protocol(MCP)标准化框架，让LLM能够与外部资源和工具交互，实现雷达的映射过程和实时词汇查找

Result: 系统显著提高了映射效率和准确性，无需训练即可使用，产出适合直接使用的结构化推理输出

Conclusion: 该方法为OMOP CDM数据标准化提供了一种高效、准确且可解释的映射解决方案，适用于探索性和生产环境

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

Conclusion: E&E能够突破局部新颖性边界，以人类可理解的方式探索行为空间，为人工生命等领域的开放式探索提供了有前景的模板

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

*Ángel Aso-Mollar,Diego Aineto,Enrico Scala,Eva Onaindia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种高效的搜索算法，将控制参数作为真正的决策点来处理，而非作为约束来处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将控制参数作为嵌入式约束处理，而非将其视为搜索空间中的真正决策点。这个方法导致效率不高。

Method: 开发了一种最优丘趋向的质数搜索算法，运行在由控制参数定义的无穷决策空间上。算法利用延迟部分扩展的概念，逐步扩展状态的子集。

Result: 证明了该算法在某些条件下具有极限完备性，并在解决涉及控制参数的规划问题时与现有方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 这种新颖的搜索算法是解决涉及控制参数规划问题的竞争性替代方案。

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

*Minjong Yoo,Jinwoo Jang,Sihyung Yoon,Honguk Woo*

TL;DR: 提出了WorMI框架，通过测试时组合将LLM的推理能力与领域特定世界模型结合，实现跨域适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI中智能体在新领域适应需要大量数据收集和重新训练的问题，提高数据效率和适应性

Method: 使用基于原型的模型检索方法，通过轨迹抽象表示匹配，开发世界级复合注意力机制整合多个世界模型知识

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFWorld基准测试中，相比多个LLM方法在未见领域实现了优异的零样本和少样本性能

Conclusion: 该框架在需要适应性和数据效率的具身智能体场景中具有可扩展的实际部署潜力

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR)框架，通过将LLM生成的反思整合到结构化的元策略内存中，在推理时通过软内存引导解码和硬规则可接受性检查来提升智能体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反思策略产生的是短暂、任务特定的痕迹，无法跨任务复用；基于强化学习的方法需要大量参数更新和计算资源。需要一种既能重用纠正知识又不需要模型权重更新的方法。

Method: MPR框架包含：1) 将LLM反思整合为结构化谓词式元策略内存(MPM)；2) 推理时通过软内存引导解码和硬规则可接受性检查(HAC)两种机制应用内存；3) 外部化可重用纠正知识。

Result: 在基于AlfWorld的文本智能体环境中，相比Reflexion基线，在执行准确性和鲁棒性方面获得一致提升，规则可接受性检查进一步提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: MPR框架能够在不更新模型权重的情况下外部化可重用纠正知识，强制执行领域约束以减少不安全或无效动作，同时保持基于语言的反思的适应性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoPBO是一个基于大型语言模型的框架，用于自动优化伪布尔优化(PBO)局部搜索求解器，在多个基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪布尔优化(PBO)局部搜索求解器的设计需要大量专家努力和手动调优，而大型语言模型(LLM)在算法设计自动化方面展现潜力但尚未应用于PBO求解器优化。

Method: 提出AutoPBO框架，利用LLM自动增强PBO局部搜索求解器，通过自动化方式改进求解器的内部启发式策略。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试(包括真实世界基准、PB竞赛基准、整数线性规划基准和组合基准)上，AutoPBO相比六种最先进竞争对手(包括NuPBO、OraSLS、PBO-IHS、RoundingSat、Gurobi和SCIP)表现出显著改进，同时保持竞争优势。

Conclusion: AutoPBO为自动化局部搜索求解器设计提供了一种有前景的方法，证明了LLM在优化PBO求解器方面的有效性。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

TL;DR: 提出了CoT-Space理论框架，将LLM推理从离散token预测重新定义为连续语义空间中的优化过程，解释了最优CoT长度收敛的理论机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统token级RL框架无法与多步推理过程（如Chain-of-Thought）的推理级性质对齐，存在理论空白

Method: 引入CoT-Space框架，从噪声视角和风险视角分析推理过程，证明最优CoT长度收敛是欠拟合和过拟合权衡的自然结果

Result: 大量实验为理论发现提供了强有力的实证验证，框架能够解释过度思考等经验现象

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为经验现象提供一致解释，还为开发更有效和可泛化的推理智能体奠定了坚实的理论基础

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在形式推理能力方面仍然不足，神经符号LLM推理方法虽然很有前景，但其成功因素尚不清楚，特别是形式语言选择的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 通过比较四种形式语言在三个数据集和七个LLM上的表现，分析形式语言选择对语法和语义推理能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现形式语言的选择确实会影响神经符号推理的性能，不同LLM对形式语言的选择表现出不同的敏感度。

Conclusion: 形式语言的选择是神经符号LLM推理中一个重要的设计决策，需要根据具体任务和模型特性进行优化选择。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

Method: 训练强化学习代理基于位置和大气数据预计算近似最优路径，在运行时用这些路径约束底层路径规划求解器，缩小搜索空间

Result: 实证结果显示燃油消耗与传统无约束求解器几乎相同（偏差通常在1%以内），计算速度相比传统求解器提升高达50%

Conclusion: 该方法能显著加速航班路径优化，在保持近乎相同燃油效率的同时大幅提升计算性能，适用于紧急情况下的快速路径重规划

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

Method: 设计实验让DQN和CFR代理相互对战并记录行动，分析诈唬行为表现

Result: DQN和CFR都表现出诈唬行为但方式不同，虽然尝试诈唬的频率不同但成功诈唬率大致相同

Conclusion: 诈唬是游戏本身的重要方面而非算法特性，未来应研究不同诈唬风格和完整扑克游戏

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

Motivation: 研究MLN在无限大域上的分布特性，理解软约束权重对极限行为的影响，以及比较不同概率图模型在渐近意义上的表达能力。

Method: 通过分析三种具体MLN示例：(1)单一元关系符号的量化无关MLN；(2)偏好较少三角形的图MLN；(3)偏好较少高度数顶点的图MLN，研究其随机结构在域大小趋于无穷时的性质。

Result: 给出了单一元关系MLN极限行为的完整特征描述；获得了FO逻辑的δ-近似0-1定律；展示了软约束权重对极限行为的不同影响；证明了量化无关MLN与提升贝叶斯网络的渐近不可比较性。

Conclusion: MLN的软约束类型决定了随机结构的极限行为差异，权重可能影响也可能不影响极限行为；在大域上，MLN确定的分布与均匀分布集中在完全不同的可能世界空间区域。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在谈判中忽视了情感的功能性作用，仅生成被动、偏好驱动的情感响应，使其容易受到对手操纵和战略利用。

Method: 提出EvoEmo框架，将情感状态转换建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用基于种群的遗传优化算法，在不同谈判场景中演化高奖励的情感策略。

Result: EvoEmo在两个基线（普通策略和固定情感策略）上均表现更优，实现了更高的成功率、效率和买家节省。

Conclusion: 自适应情感表达对于构建更有效的多轮谈判LLM代理至关重要。

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

Result: 即使在低规划预算设置下，也能显著提升性能表现

Conclusion: 通过简单的框架修改，可以显著提高AlphaZero在变化测试环境中的适应性和性能

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

*Petr Průcha,Michaela Matoušková,Jan Strnad*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究比较了基于LLM的智能代理自动化(AACU)与传统RPA在企业工作流自动化中的表现，发现RPA在执行速度和可靠性方面更优，但AACU开发时间更短且适应性更强


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，智能代理自动化(AACU)成为一种新的自动化范式，研究需要验证其是否能作为传统RPA的可行替代方案

Method: 通过控制实验，在数据录入、监控和文档提取三个标准RPA挑战任务中，对比UiPath(RPA)和Anthropic计算机使用代理(AACU)在速度、可靠性和开发工作量方面的表现

Result: RPA在执行速度和可靠性方面优于AACU，特别是在重复性、稳定环境中；但AACU显著减少了开发时间，并能更灵活地适应动态界面

Conclusion: 当前AACU实现尚未达到生产就绪水平，但在快速原型设计和轻量级自动化方面具有明显优势，未来研究应探索多代理编排、混合RPA-AACU架构以及跨行业平台的更稳健评估

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm
in automation: LLM agents or Agentic Automation with Computer Use (AACU).
Unlike traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which relies on rule-based
workflows and scripting, AACU enables intelligent agents to perform tasks
through natural language instructions and autonomous interaction with user
interfaces. This study investigates whether AACU can serve as a viable
alternative to RPA in enterprise workflow automation. We conducted controlled
experiments across three standard RPA challenges data entry, monitoring, and
document extraction comparing RPA (via UiPath) and AACU (via Anthropic's
Computer Use Agent) in terms of speed, reliability, and development effort.
Results indicate that RPA outperforms AACU in execution speed and reliability,
particularly in repetitive, stable environments. However, AACU significantly
reduces development time and adapts more flexibly to dynamic interfaces. While
current AACU implementations are not yet production-ready, their promise in
rapid prototyping and lightweight automation is evident. Future research should
explore multi-agent orchestration, hybrid RPA-AACU architectures, and more
robust evaluation across industries and platforms.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究通过简历筛选实验发现，人们在与带种族偏见的AI协作时，会被动地遵循AI的偏见选择同一种族的候选人，即使认为AI建议质量低也会受影响。隐性联想测试可以减少这种影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查人们在与带有种族偏见的AI系统协作时的行为变化，以及隐性联想测试在减少AI偏见影响中的作用。

Method: 进行简历筛选实验(N=528)，使用模拟的带种族偏见的AI模型，评估高低地位职业的候选人。测量参与者的隐性种族-地位联想(IATs)，分析1,526个场景下的选择行为。

Result: 当AI偏向某种族时，人们也会偏向选择该种族候选人(达90%)。完成IAT测试后，选择违背种族-地位定型的候选人概率提高13%。即使认为AI建议质量低，人们的决策仍受AI偏见影响。

Conclusion: 组织和监管政策应认识到AI-人协同决策的复杂性，在实施系统、培训用户和确定监管范围时需考虑这些发现。

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

TL;DR: 基于正交分解的维度降低策略和在线更新机制，通过温度映射框架近似流形上的函数，在精度和效率方面超过传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在高维数据流形上近似函数时的计算挑战，提高算法的可扩展性和效率

Method: 基于温度映射框架，利用距离矩阵的低秩结构进行维度降低，并开发在线更新机制以高效整合新数据

Result: 数值实验显示方法在精度和效率方面超过传统神经网络和插值方法，特别是在稀疏CT重建应用中

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动方法能够高效地近似流形上的函数，通过维度降低和在线更新机制解决了高维数据处理的计算挑战

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出基于黎曼几何的新型神经网络优化器，利用损失景观在高维空间嵌入时自然诱导的度量，在低维任务中表现优异，对现有方法略有改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从几何视角出发，利用损失景观可视化中常见的黎曼度量结构，开发理论上具有理想性质的新型优化器

Method: 基于损失景观在高维空间嵌入时诱导的黎曼度量，开发新的优化算法，可修改任何现有的预处理方法，计算复杂度与Adam相当

Result: 在低维示例中非常有效，相比SGD、Adam、AdamW、Muon等state-of-the-art方法略有改进，有效学习率在曲率高区域自动降低

Conclusion: 这类新型优化器具有理论优势，可作为梯度裁剪的平滑形式，其中一个变体可视为诱导有效调度学习率，解耦权重衰减是几何视角的自然选择

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

TL;DR: CEHR-GPT是一个通用的EHR基础模型，集成了特征表示、零样本预测和合成数据生成三大功能，采用时间标记学习框架处理临床时序数据，在多个任务上表现优异且具有良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EHR AI模型多为单一任务设计，缺乏通用性和实用性，无法满足真实医疗场景的需求。

Method: 提出CEHR-GPT基础模型，采用创新的时间标记学习框架，显式编码患者动态时间线，统一处理特征表示、零样本预测和合成数据生成。

Result: 模型在三大任务上均表现优异，通过词汇扩展和微调能有效泛化到外部数据集，支持快速模型开发、队列发现和患者预后预测。

Conclusion: CEHR-GPT为EHR数据提供了一个通用、多功能的基础模型解决方案，无需任务特定重训练即可支持多种临床应用。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于社会负担的公平性框架和MISOB算法，用于解决算法追索过程中的不公平问题，在保持分类器准确性的同时降低所有群体的社会负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感决策中的应用增加，算法追索（提供可行动步骤来逆转负面决策）的需求日益重要。但现有研究对追索过程中的公平性保证存在担忧，需要建立理论框架来确保追索的公平性。

Method: 提出了基于社会负担的公平性框架，开发了MISOB算法，该算法在现实条件下广泛适用，通过理论分析将追索和分类中的公平性保证正式联系起来。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实证结果表明，MISOB算法在不影响整体分类器准确性的情况下，成功降低了所有群体的社会负担。

Conclusion: 该研究为算法追索中的不公平问题提供了全面的理论特征描述，提出的社会负担框架和MISOB算法为解决追索公平性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了非负矩阵分解(NMF)与共同原因原理(PCC)之间的密切关系，展示了它们在图像数据处理中的相互应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NMF和PCC这两个看似不同的概念之间的内在联系，探索它们在实际数据处理中的协同作用，特别是在图像分析和概率建模方面的应用。

Method: 通过将灰度图像数据映射到概率模型，建立NMF与PCC的相互联系。利用PCC提供预测性工具来稳健估计NMF的有效秩，同时使用NMF实现PCC的近似方法。开发了基于共同原因的聚类方法和数据去噪技术。

Result: 研究发现PCC能够提供稳定的NMF秩估计，该估计对弱噪声具有鲁棒性。在此秩下实现的NMF产生的特征（基础图像）对噪声和局部优化种子也具有稳定性，有效解决了NMF的非可识别性问题。同时，NMF为PCC的实现提供了有效途径。

Conclusion: NMF和PCC之间存在深刻的数学联系，这种联系为数据降维、特征提取、聚类分析和数据去噪提供了新的理论框架和实用工具，特别是在图像处理领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

Motivation: 解决聚合学习中客户端数据异质性、能量限制和可用性约束问题，特别是时间序列数据可用性对模型收敛的影响。

Method: 提出FedDeCAB方法，通过概率排名选择可用客户，当客户离线时允许从最近邻居获取部分模型参数进行联合优化。

Result: 在大规模出租车和船舶轨迹数据集上验证，在高度异质数据分布、限制通信预算和动态客户离线/重新加入场景下有效。

Conclusion: FedDeCAB能够提高离线模型性能、降低通信开销，为带有时间序列数据可用性约束的聚合学习提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

Method: 通过分析因果和统计结构来识别机器学习失败的模式，重点关注图像分析领域。提出了两个新概念："无公平午餐"问题和"子群可分离性"问题。

Result: 发现当前公平表示学习方法无法充分解决这两个新识别的问题，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要为机器学习公平性研究寻找新的前进路径，以解决这些被忽视但关键的问题，确保机器学习在高风险领域的安全部署。

Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse
still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods
in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to
provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal
and statistical structures which induce failure in machine learning methods for
image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call
the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability}
problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

TL;DR: SharedRep-RLHF是一个新的RLHF框架，通过学习群体间共享特征来解决MaxMin-RLHF在少数群体表现不佳的问题，相比现有方法提升高达20%的胜率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的统一奖励RLHF无法捕捉不同子群体的意见多样性，偏向主导群体。MaxMin-RLHF虽然通过群体特定奖励模型促进公平性，但在少数群体作为最小奖励群体时表现不佳。

Method: SharedRep-RLHF通过学习不同群体标注中的共享特征，而不是为每个群体学习单独的奖励模型。该方法能够更有效地学习共享特征，并量化了其样本复杂度。

Result: 在多种自然语言任务上的实验表明，SharedRep-RLHF相比MaxMin-RLHF效果显著，胜率提升最高达到20%。

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF通过利用群体间共享特征，有效解决了现有RLHF方法在少数群体上的性能问题，为多群体偏好建模提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

demonstrated its application potential in modern games. Beginning with
foundational work and progressing to landmark achievements such as AlphaStar in
StarCraft II and OpenAI Five in Dota 2, MARL has proven capable of achieving
superhuman performance across diverse game environments through techniques like
self-play, supervised learning, and deep reinforcement learning. With its
growing impact, a comprehensive review has become increasingly important in

coordination, and scalability, and highlight successful implementations in
games like Rocket League, Minecraft, Quake III Arena, StarCraft II, Dota 2,
Honor of Kings, etc. This paper offers insights into MARL in video game AI
systems, proposes a novel method to estimate game complexity, and suggests
future research directions to advance MARL and its applications in game
development, inspiring further innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

### [137] [Delta Activations: A Representation for Finetuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04442)
*Zhiqiu Xu,Amish Sethi,Mayur Naik,Ser-Nam Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delta Activations方法通过测量微调模型相对于基础模型的内部激活变化，将微调模型表示为向量嵌入，用于模型聚类和分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型的微调版本数量庞大，但由于元数据不一致和存储库非结构化，难以有效导航和理解这些模型。

Method: 通过计算微调模型与基础模型在相同输入下的内部激活差异，生成向量表示，支持模型聚类、任务嵌入、模型选择和合并。

Result: Delta Activations能够有效按领域和任务对模型进行聚类，对微调设置具有鲁棒性，在混合数据集微调时表现出可加性。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于促进公开可用模型的复用实践，为模型生态系统提供了结构化的理解和分析工具。

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图随机特征(GRFs)在图节点核的可扩展高斯过程中的应用，证明了在温和假设下，使用GRFs的贝叶斯推理具有O(N^{3/2})的时间复杂度，相比精确核的O(N^3)显著提升，实现了在单芯片上处理超过100万个节点的图贝叶斯优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决图节点核在贝叶斯推理中计算复杂度高(O(N^3))的问题，使得大规模图上的贝叶斯优化变得不可行，需要开发更高效的近似方法。

Method: 采用图随机特征(GRFs)作为图节点核的随机估计器，用于构建可扩展的高斯过程模型，在离散输入空间上进行贝叶斯推理。

Result: 理论证明GRFs方法将时间复杂度从O(N^3)降低到O(N^{3/2})，实验显示在单芯片上能够处理超过100万个节点的图，同时保持竞争性的性能表现。

Conclusion: GRFs方法为大规模图上的贝叶斯优化提供了高效的解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求，使得在普通硬件上处理超大规模图成为可能。

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently
introduced stochastic estimator of graph node kernels - to scalable Gaussian
processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions)
Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect
to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial
wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs
with over $10^6$ nodes on a single computer chip, whilst preserving competitive
performance.

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

*Tristan Luca Saidi,Abigail Hickok,Bastian Rieck,Andrew J. Blumberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOR是一种新的随机邻域嵌入算法，通过引入离散图曲率来改进UMAP和tSNE在噪声高维数据可视化中的几何结构保持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SNE算法如UMAP和tSNE在处理噪声高维数据时，往往无法保持数据的几何结构，容易出现虚假分离连接组件和无法发现良好聚类结构的问题。

Method: 提出EmbedOR算法，采用曲率增强的距离度量方法，强调底层聚类结构，通过离散图曲率来改进嵌入过程。

Result: 实验证明EmbedOR在合成和真实数据上具有更好的可视化效果和几何结构保持能力，相比其他SNE算法和UMAP更不容易分割连续高密度区域。

Conclusion: EmbedOR不仅提供了改进的可视化算法，其距离度量还可用于注释现有可视化结果，识别分割问题并提供对数据底层几何结构的深入洞察。

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

*Qiyuan Chen,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在线测试问题(OTP)，针对流式受试者寻找最优测试策略。当测试相关且成本高时，需要选择测试子集进行部分测试，但由于缺失数据导致的估计偏差使得问题比标准MDP更难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，对每个受试者进行所有候选测试成本过高，需要选择测试子集。但测试结果的联合分布未知且必须在线学习，部分测试导致的缺失数据会带来估计偏差，这使得问题比标准情景MDP更具挑战性。

Method: 提出了探索-提交(Explore-Then-Commit)算法来处理OTP问题，并研究了奖励与缺失数据无关的变体问题(Online Cost-sensitive Maximum Entropy Sampling Problem)，使用迭代消除算法。

Result: 证明了OTP的最小最大遗憾下界为Ω(T^{2/3})，高于标准MDP的Θ(√T)下界。提出的算法实现了Õ(T^{2/3})的累积遗憾。对于奖励与缺失数据无关的变体问题，迭代消除算法实现了Õ(√T)遗憾。

Conclusion: 这项工作深化了对缺失数据下探索-利用权衡的理解，为设计高效的顺序测试策略提供了指导。缺失数据依赖的奖励结构显著影响了学习难度，不同问题结构需要不同的算法设计。

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

TL;DR: 提出了可微分的范围划分熵估计器，使该计算几何概念可用于深度学习，通过熵正则化提升算法效率和结构化表示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 范围划分熵在算法设计中提供强大保证，但尚未在深度学习中使用，需要使其可微分以作为可训练损失或正则化器

Method: 提出首个可微分范围划分熵近似估计器，设计EntropyNet神经模块重构数据为低熵形式，并将熵正则化应用于Transformer注意力机制

Result: 在几何任务中实现4.1倍运行加速且误差<0.2%；在深度学习中实现80%稀疏度下准确率比L1基线高6%

Conclusion: 熵有界计算不仅是理论优雅的，而且是实现自适应学习、效率和结构化表示的实用机制

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

Motivation: 研究神经算子（neural operators）的表示特性，尽管它们在科学计算中日益重要，但其表示属性仍未得到充分探索。柏拉图表示假说认为神经网络会收敛到跨架构的相似表示，但神经算子的表示统一问题需要新的方法。

Method: 扩展稀疏自编码器（SAEs）到提升空间和无限维函数空间，比较SAEs、lifted-SAE和SAE神经算子的推理和训练动态。通过提升和算子模块引入有益的归纳偏置。

Result: 提升和算子模块能够实现更快的恢复、改进平滑概念的恢复，以及在变化分辨率下的鲁棒推理，这是神经算子独有的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将稀疏模型恢复方法扩展到神经算子领域，为大型神经算子的机制可解释性提供了有效工具，并展示了提升和算子模块在表示统一中的优势。

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

Motivation: 卫星图像机器学习在农业、生态和人类发展应用中受限于标注训练数据的稀疏性，现有研究主要关注模型架构而非直接建模数据条件，导致科学家和政策制定者不确定如何收集额外数据来最大化性能。

Method: 提出了空间训练数据优化的首个问题框架，考虑了异构数据收集成本和现实预算约束，开发了新颖的方法来解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 该问题框架和方法设计用于跨SatML应用领域的泛化，特别关注了在Togo农业调查中的实际应用，为大规模监测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

Conclusion: 对抗性协同进化是学习工具性世界模型的有力方法，能够推动智能体实现更大的战略深度和鲁棒性

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索奖励函数的基本属性如何影响稀疏奖励强化学习的效率，特别是低秩结构在奖励矩阵中的作用。

Method: 提出了Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC)方法，将矩阵补全理论与强化学习相结合，通过策略依赖采样分析，提供奖励无关的表示学习、分布无关的置信集和鲁棒补全保证。

Result: 在100个系统采样领域中发现超过一半存在可利用结构，PAMC相比强基线方法样本效率提升1.6-2.1倍，仅增加约20%计算开销。

Conclusion: 结构化奖励学习是一个有前景的新范式，对机器人、医疗保健等安全关键、样本昂贵的应用具有直接意义。

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

Motivation: 时间序列预测面临分布偏移的挑战，特别是在在线部署场景中数据顺序到达需要持续适应。传统方法关注参数选择和更新策略，但作者认为分布偏移源于潜在因素变化，需要更新特征表示

Method: 提出ADAPT-Z方法，使用适配器模块结合当前特征表示和历史梯度信息，在延迟反馈的多步预测场景中实现鲁棒的参数更新

Result: 大量实验表明该方法始终优于无适应的基准模型，并在多个数据集上超越了最先进的在线学习方法

Conclusion: 通过关注潜在因素的特征表示更新而非传统参数更新，ADAPT-Z方法有效解决了时间序列在线学习中的分布偏移和延迟反馈问题

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

Abstract: Traffic accidents can be studied to mitigate the risk of further events.
Recent advances in machine learning have provided an alternative way to study
data associated with traffic accidents. New models achieve good generalization
and high predictive power over imbalanced data. In this research, we study
neural network-based models on data related to traffic accidents. We begin
analyzing relative feature colinearity and unsupervised dimensionality
reduction through autoencoders, followed by a dense network. The features are
related to traffic accident data and the target is to classify accident
severity. Our experiments show cross-validated results of up to 92% accuracy

TL;DR: 本文从游戏论角度重新解释常数Potts模型(CPM)，通过将全局哈密顿量分解为局部效用函数，证明了通过更好响应动态在伪多项式时间内收敛到均衡分割，并提出了两种稳定性标准来提高社区检测的效率、稳健性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社区检测是数据科学中的基础问题，需要将节点划分为不相交的社区。作者们希望从游戏论角度提供对常数Potts模型(CPM)的新视角，以强调其在网络分割中的效率、稳健性和准确性。

Method: 将CPM的全局哈密顿量重新解释为潜在游戏模型，分解成局部效用函数，使得每个代理的局部效用增益与全局效用增益相匹配。利用这种等价性，证明通过更好响应动态进行局部优化可以在伪多项式时间内收敛到均衡分割。同时提出两种稳定性标准：严格标准基于新颖的稳健性概念，要求节点同时最大化社区内邻居节点和最小化非邻居节点；松缚标准基于这些目标的加权和。

Result: 实验结果显示，在社区跟踪场景中，当使用初始分割来帮助Leiden算法并给予部分真实信息时，稳健的分割能够产生更高的准确性来恢复真实社区。

Conclusion: 通过游戏论角度重新解释CPM模型，本文提供了一种有效的社区检测方法，具有伪多项式时间收敛性、稳健的分割结果以及在社区跟踪任务中的高准确性。这为网络分割问题提供了新的理论基础和实践方法。

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型缺乏三维空间理解能力的限制，通过鸟视图表征提供空间上下文，以支持车辆通信系统的可靠低延迟通信

Method: 设计轻量化插拔即用的BEV注入连接器，通过CARLA和MATLAB相关模拟环境生成RGB、LiDAR、GPS和无线信号数据，并从射线追踪输出中程序化提取指令和真实值

Result: 在三个V2I链路预测任务中均显著提升性能，精度平均提升达13.9%，在雨天和夜间极端条件下性能提升达32.7%

Conclusion: 鸟视图注入框架能够有效补充MLLM的空间理解能力，在各种任务和恶劣环境下都显示出稳健的性能提升

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often

quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

Conclusion: 基于度量学习的策略在监督学习和联邦学习范式中都能有效解决联邦设置中的表示学习挑战，FedQuad方法为解决数据异构性问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

Conclusion: SP-CCI框架通过合成数据增强有效解决了反事实推理中的保守性问题，在保证统计有效性的同时提供了更精确的预测区间。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

Method: 使用线性随机微分方程建模输入序列，通过同时对角化状态矩阵和噪声协方差，利用微分Lyapunov方程的闭式解高效传播成对不确定性。注意力权重对应于传播的成对精度的鲁棒残差重加权。

Result: 提出了AFA机制，在保持与标准注意力相同计算和内存复杂度的同时，能够更好地处理序列动态特性。在特定极限条件下可以恢复为普通点积注意力。

Conclusion: AFA是一种新颖的注意力机制，通过整合动力学模型为序列建模提供了新的视角，在计算效率和处理不确定性方面具有优势。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

TL;DR: 时间序列预测模型存在成员推断攻击漏洞，研究提出了两种新攻击方法，在实际数据集上证明了用户级攻击可达到完美检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成员推断攻击在分类模型中已经得到广泛研究，但在时间序列预测领域的影响仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出了两种新的攻击方法：(1)将多变量LiRA攻击适配到时间序列预测场景；(2)新的端到端学习方法Deep Time Series (DTS)攻击。在TUH-EEG和ELD数据集上证验了这些方法。

Result: 预测模型存在漏洞，用户级攻击往往能够实现完美检测。提出的方法在多个设置下表现最优，成为时间序列预测隐私风险评估的新基准。

Conclusion: 时间序列预测模型存在显著的隐私风险，并且随着预测距离加长和训练数据量减少，漏洞会更加严重，这与大语言模型中观察到的趋势相似。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

Motivation: 对现有GNN过平滑分析工作进行深入探讨和扩展，特别是在Dirichlet能量框架下，为理解过平滑现象提供更全面的理论支撑。

Method: 使用谱分析方法和Dirichlet能量理论，在温和谱条件下证明节点嵌入能量的指数衰减特性，扩展到谱多项式滤波器和Leaky-ReLU激活函数，并通过边删除和权重放大实验进行验证。

Result: 证明了在包括Leaky-ReLU在内的温和谱条件下，节点嵌入的Dirichlet能量确实随网络深度指数衰减，实验显示了Dirichlet能量增加的具体情况。

Conclusion: 研究为理解GNN中的过平滑现象提供了重要的理论洞见，实验结果表明通过特定的网络设计（如边删除和权重调整）可以缓解过平滑问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral
conditions (including with Leaky-ReLU), the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings
decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

TL;DR: Set Block Decoding (SBD) 是一种新的解码范式，通过结合标准的下一个token预测和掩码token预测，实现并行采样多个非连续的未来token，在保持性能的同时将生成所需的前向传播次数减少3-5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在推理阶段面临高计算和内存成本的问题，特别是在解码阶段，需要寻找更高效的生成方法。

Method: 提出Set Block Decoding (SBD)范式，在单一架构中整合标准下一个token预测(NTP)和掩码token预测(MATP)，允许并行采样多个非连续的未来token，无需架构修改或额外训练超参数。

Result: 通过对Llama-3.1 8B和Qwen-3 8B进行微调，SBD实现了3-5倍的生成加速，同时保持与等效NTP训练相同的性能。

Conclusion: SBD提供了一种简单灵活的解码加速方法，能够显著减少推理成本而不牺牲准确性，且与现有KV缓存技术兼容。

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

Method: 提出One-Embedding-Fits-All范式，构建统一表示空间，每个模型用一个嵌入表示，通过相似度匹配为不同任务动态选择最优模型。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval零样本预测基准测试中表现优异，同时保持单个模型的效率，能够无缝集成新模型并实现渐进式精度提升。

Conclusion: ZooCast有效利用了不同时间序列基础模型的互补优势，通过智能模型选择和集成机制，在零样本预测任务中实现了性能提升和效率平衡。

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and

Result: RL微调在保持原有知识方面显著优于SFT，KL散度较小的解决方案能更好地保留先验能力

Conclusion: 提出了"RL剃刀原则"：在解决新任务的所有方法中，强化学习偏好选择与原始模型KL距离最小的解决方案

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用问题结构特性和改进的交互机制，为差分隐私权衡优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the

compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB

empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

*Yin Huang,Yongqi Dong,Youhua Tang,Li Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SST-iTransformer模型用于停车位可用性预测，通过自监督时空表示学习和双分支注意力机制，整合多源交通数据，在成都真实数据上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 私家车快速增长加剧城市停车难题，需要准确预测停车可用性来支持城市规划管理。现有方法在时空依赖建模和多源数据利用方面存在局限。

Method: 使用K-means聚类建立停车集群区域，整合地铁、公交、网约车、出租车等多源交通数据。基于iTransformer改进，加入掩码重构自监督学习，采用双分支注意力机制（序列注意力捕获长期时序依赖，通道注意力建模跨变量交互）。

Result: 在成都真实数据上超越所有基线模型（包括Informer、Autoformer等），达到最低MSE和竞争性MAE。消融实验显示网约车数据贡献最大，出租车次之，固定线路交通特征贡献较小。空间相关性分析证实排除相关停车位历史数据会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: SST-iTransformer能有效建模时空依赖关系，多源交通数据整合对停车预测至关重要，特别是动态交通数据（网约车/出租车）比固定线路数据更具预测价值。

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于偏差-方差权衡的新题活跃学习策略，通过偏差-协方差关系利用历史数据和批处理来减少实验误差，在批处设置下超越BALD和最小信心等标准方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际实验场景中存在异方差偶然不确定性，且这种不确定性在批处设置下可能相关。需要新的主动学习策略来直接减少实验轮次间的偏差

Method: 利用偏差-方差权衡关系，提出新的主动学习策略，考虑有噪声和无噪声模型系统，通过偏差-协方差关系二次利用历史数据，采用特征分解策略实现批处处理

Result: 在批处设置下（使用二次估计器），新方法超过了多个标准方法包括BALD和最小信心

Conclusion: 通过偏差-协方差关系的差分基方法能够有效减少实验误差，在批处处理异方差偶然不确定性时显示出优秀性能，为实际实验场景提供了有效的主动学习解决方案

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PagedEviction是一种针对vLLM PagedAttention的细粒度KV缓存剪枝策略，通过块级逐出算法提高内存效率，在长上下文任务中实现了更好的内存使用和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着序列长度增加，KV缓存成为内存瓶颈，需要更高效的内存管理策略来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出PagedEviction方法，这是一种针对分页内存布局设计的块级逐出算法，与PagedAttention无缝集成且无需修改CUDA注意力内核。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct等模型上的LongBench基准测试显示，相比基线方法，PagedEviction在内存使用和长上下文任务准确性方面都有提升。

Conclusion: PagedEviction有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，为长序列LLM推理提供了更高效的内存管理方案。

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

TL;DR: TiM模型通过引入精确的连续时间动力学方程，解决了生成模型中迭代步骤与输出质量之间的根本矛盾，在保持高效的同时实现了单调质量提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成建模中的基本困境：迭代扩散模型计算成本高，而高效少步替代方案存在质量上限限制

Method: 引入精确的连续时间动力学方程，定义任意有限时间间隔的状态转换，构建Transition Models (TiM)生成范式

Result: 仅用865M参数就超越SD3.5(8B)和FLUX.1(12B)，在所有评估步数上达到最先进性能，且随着采样预算增加呈现单调质量改进

Conclusion: TiM提供了一种新的生成范式，能够无缝适应任意步数转换，从单步跳跃到多步精细化，在高达4096x4096分辨率下提供卓越保真度

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

TL;DR: IPA是一种特征感知投影框架，通过保留降维隐藏空间中的信息来改进LoRA方法，在语言和视觉基准测试中表现优于LoRA和DoRA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的下投影是随机初始化和数据无关的，丢弃了潜在有用信息，而分析表明下投影在训练中变化很小，成为性能瓶颈

Method: 提出IPA框架，在线性情况下使用近似顶部主成分的算法实例化，实现高效投影器预训练且推理开销可忽略

Result: 在常识推理任务上平均准确率比LoRA高1.5个百分点，在VTAB-1k上高2.3个百分点，冻结投影时用约一半可训练参数达到完整LoRA性能

Conclusion: IPA通过特征感知投影有效解决了LoRA随机输入压缩的性能瓶颈问题，在参数效率和性能之间取得了更好平衡

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

Conclusion: HCL能够发现可解释的机制级因果异质性，在科学发现领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

Method: 推导了统一策略梯度估计器，将各种后训练方法表示为不同数据分布假设下的共同目标梯度。提出了混合后训练算法HPT，动态选择不同训练信号

Result: 在6个数学推理基准和2个分布外测试集上，HPT在不同规模和系列的模型上都持续超越强基线

Conclusion: 成功建立了统一的理论框架，证明了RL和SFT方法的统一性，HPT算法能有效利用演示数据并保持稳定的探索能力

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

Conclusion: 通过状态空间模型框架为ESN提供了系统的理论基础和分析工具，将启发式设计转变为基于第一原理的方法论

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.
