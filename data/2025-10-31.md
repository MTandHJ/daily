### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在水下目标检测中的有效性，比较了YOLOv5、T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM三种模型，发现时空增强模型显著提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决动态海洋环境中水下目标检测的挑战，特别是在突然运动、部分遮挡和渐变运动条件下提高检测准确性。

Method: 第一阶段评估T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段开发了集成卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本。

Result: YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，时空增强模型在复杂目标检测中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测可靠性，而T-YOLOv5+CBAM在挑战性场景中进一步提升了性能，但在简单场景中准确率有所损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练过程中直接让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，而不是在生成后进行后处理选择，从而提高了生成图像的质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练，虽然能够实现多样化生成，但不符合用户偏好。现有的奖励模型方法通过后处理选择图像来对齐奖励，但会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练过程中让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是在生成后进行后处理。

Result: MIRO方法显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量，并大幅加快了训练速度。在GenEval组合基准测试和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过在训练过程中直接学习多个奖励模型的条件，MIRO方法能够更好地对齐用户偏好，同时保持生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [3] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建了BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集，通过领域特定训练显著提升了分割性能。

Motivation: 随着电动自行车普及，骑行者面临的安全风险增加，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车安全应用中。

Method: 使用多传感器SenseBike研究平台，开发自行车专用的3D LiDAR分割方法，并创建包含3021个连续LiDAR扫描的BikeScenes数据集，包含29个动态和静态类别的语义标注。

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调的模型达到63.6%的平均交并比，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%结果。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为自行车中心的LiDAR分割研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，通过物理信息合成数据训练模型，能够有效修复图像并实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和缓慢串行数据采集的限制，减少针尖调节频率并提高现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Method: 使用仅36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练最先进的流匹配和扩散模型。

Result: 模型能够有效修复图像，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像，实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验通量，减少针尖调节程序频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的无反演图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示、独立计算子流并自适应聚合来解决现有流模型在图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前整流流模型在图像生成中表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在关键限制：反转过程不准确导致真实图像无法准确映射到潜在空间，编辑过程中的梯度纠缠问题导致输出无法忠实反映目标提示。

Method: 提出流分解与聚合框架：1）将目标提示语义分解为多个子提示；2）为每个子提示计算独立流；3）设计投影和软聚合机制，自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解缠方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法，能够生成既多样化又语义一致的编辑输出。

Conclusion: 通过流分解与聚合的无反演框架有效解决了图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题，在保持多样性的同时确保了语义一致性。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

### [6] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Brain-IT方法，通过脑交互变换器从fMRI脑记录重建视觉图像，实现更忠实于原始图像的生成效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的方法在从fMRI重建视觉图像时缺乏对实际所见图像的忠实性，需要更有效的方法来提升重建质量

Method: 使用脑交互变换器(BIT)实现功能相似脑体素簇之间的有效交互，预测高层次语义特征和低层次结构特征来指导扩散模型

Result: 在视觉和客观指标上都超越了当前最先进方法，仅用1小时fMRI数据就能达到与40小时训练相当的效果

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑启发的功能簇交互机制，实现了更忠实的图像重建，显著提升了从fMRI重建视觉图像的性能

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [7] [Fine-tuning Segment Anything for Real-Time Tumor Tracking in Cine-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25990)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SAM 2.1基础模型的实时肿瘤跟踪方法，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中取得第六名，Dice得分为0.8794。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在数据稀缺约束下对胸腹部区域cine-MRI序列进行实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战。

Method: 采用SAM 2.1 b+基础模型，使用第一张标注切片的掩码作为提示，在TrackRAD2025的小规模标注数据上进行微调，采用平衡Dice+IoU损失函数和低学习率策略。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上达到0.8794的Dice分数，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中排名第六。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放疗中实现准确实时肿瘤跟踪方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [8] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Mamba框架的方法，通过Hilbert选择性扫描机制增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，从而更有效地探索特征空间，提升低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba框架在低光图像增强中存在信息不一致和空间局部性不足的问题，需要更有效的特征空间探索机制来捕捉精细细节。

Method: 引入Hilbert选择性扫描机制，增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，改进特征空间探索，同时保持处理长距离依赖的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了定量指标和定性视觉质量，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了低光图像增强的最新技术，也为基于Mamba技术的更广泛应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

*Rishika Bhagwatkar,Syrielle Montariol,Angelika Romanou,Beatriz Borges,Irina Rish,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVE是首个真实世界视觉异常基准，支持异常描述、解释和合理性判断三个开放任务，为评估视觉语言模型在异常检测和理解方面的能力提供了全面框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉中的异常检测主要局限于工业缺陷或合成生成的异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，而人类能够自然地识别、推理和解释环境中的异常。

Method: CAVE基准基于认知科学研究，提供细粒度标注，包括视觉定位和基于视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性的异常分类，这些标注受人类识别和解决异常方式的启发。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍然存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE通过提供真实且认知基础扎实的基准，为推进异常检测和视觉语言模型中的常识推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级CNN模型，用于预测不同海平面上升情景下的沿海洪水，在阿布扎比和旧金山两个地区验证了模型的泛化能力，平均减少洪水深度预测误差近20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化和海平面上升对沿海城市构成日益严重的威胁，传统物理模拟器计算成本高，深度学习技术面临数据稀缺和高维输出等挑战，需要开发高效准确的洪水预测方法。

Method: 基于最近提出的视觉驱动、低资源深度学习框架，开发了轻量级卷积神经网络模型，用于预测不同海平面上升预测和海岸线适应情景下的沿海洪水。

Result: 模型在两个不同地理区域（阿布扎比和旧金山）的数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力，显著优于现有最先进方法，预测洪水深度图的平均绝对误差平均降低近20%。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为沿海洪水管理的可扩展实用工具，帮助决策者制定有效的缓解策略以应对气候变化日益增长的影响。

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时序注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理视频复杂时序动态方面存在明显局限，特别是在理解动作序列和时序进展方面表现不佳。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接集成堆叠时序注意力模块，通过时序注意力机制更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系，然后将视觉token传递给LLM。

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME基准上提升了最高+5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解方面的关键差距。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化视频广告剪辑框架，将视频剪辑重新定义为针对广告的镜头选择问题，强调音频的重要性，并开发了双流音视频融合模型来预测视频帧的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广告商需要为同一广告活动制作不同时长的多个版本，传统手动剪辑方法耗时耗力，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用双流音视频融合模型预测视频帧的重要性，其中重要性定义为帧被选入企业制作的短广告的可能性。

Result: 在AdSum204数据集上的实验表明，该模型在平均精度、AUC、Spearman和Kendall等多种指标上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将视频剪辑作为广告特定的镜头选择问题，证明了音频在广告中的关键作用，提出的模型在广告剪辑任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL是一种新颖的上下文学习框架，用于超声图像中的骨骼区域分割，只需5%的训练图像就能实现鲁棒分割性能，在四个手腕和肘部超声数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和手腕骨折超声图像分割中专家标注耗时耗力的问题，为轻训练用户提供实时反馈和关键结构突出显示。

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，采用图像拼接技术和训练策略进行视觉上下文学习，在视频内分割设置中仅标注少量帧，模型分割未见帧。

Result: 在1,252个超声扫描上，Dice系数比Painter、MAE-VQGAN、U-Net和TransUNet等最先进模型高出1-27%。

Conclusion: FlexICL为标注数据稀缺的医学影像用例提供了高效可扩展的超声图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的动态负提示方法，在去噪过程中自适应生成负提示，相比传统固定负提示方法效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的具体图像内容进行动态调整，限制了负提示的效果。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示，实现动态负提示生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，展示了负引导强度与文本-图像对齐之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法能够更有效地利用负提示信息，提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on

### [15] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PReMA攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像而不改变提示词来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出，特别是在图像修复和风格转换任务中生成不当内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型（如文生图模型）中文本和图像模态的对齐不足，存在生成不当或NSFW内容的风险，而现有攻击方法主要关注生成对抗性提示词。

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)，通过创建对抗性图像来操纵模型输出，而不修改提示词本身。

Result: 在多种模型的图像修复和风格转换任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成了新的威胁，特别是在使用固定提示词的图像编辑应用中。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

*Minjoon Jung,Junbin Xiao,Junghyun Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoExo-Con基准，评估视频LLM在不同视角下对同一事件的时间理解一致性，发现现有模型存在跨视角一致性差的问题，并提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频LLM在不同视角（第一人称和第三人称）下对同一事件的时间理解是否一致，现有模型在这方面存在明显不足。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的第一人称和第三人称视频对，评估时间验证和时间定位任务。提出View-GRPO强化学习框架，增强特定视角的时间推理能力并促进跨视角一致性理解。

Result: 现有视频LLM在跨视角一致性方面表现较差，远低于单视角性能。View-GRPO方法相比朴素SFT和GRPO在提升跨视角一致性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效提升模型在这方面的性能。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: OracleAgent是首个用于甲骨文信息结构化管理和检索的智能体系统，通过整合多模态知识库和LLM能力，显著提升甲骨文研究效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多任务解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下。学者需要花费大量时间搜索、整理和管理相关资源。

Method: 构建了包含140万单字拓片图像和8万解释文本的多模态知识库，开发了集成多种甲骨文分析工具和LLM的智能体系统OracleAgent，能够灵活编排这些组件。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务中表现优异，超越主流MLLMs（如GPT-4o）。案例研究显示能有效协助领域专家，显著降低研究时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent是甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统实用化部署的重要进展，为文化遗产保护提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出联合优化3D高斯点和相机位姿的统一框架，无需预标定输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和位姿精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机位姿估计工具如COLMAP，存在计算瓶颈和误差传播问题

Method: 将联合优化分解为两个交替阶段：固定位姿下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数；使用结合几何和光度约束的自定义3D光流算法优化相机位姿

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有无COLMAP技术，并普遍超越基于COLMAP的基准方法

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架有效解决了传统方法在大视角变化和稀疏特征分布等挑战性场景中的投影误差问题

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了WOD-E2E数据集和RFS评估指标，专注于测试端到端驾驶系统在长尾场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在罕见但关键的长尾场景中的表现，且现有评估指标难以有效衡量多模态驾驶性能。

Method: 构建了包含4,021个驾驶片段（约12小时）的WOD-E2E数据集，专门针对发生频率低于0.03%的挑战性长尾场景，并提出基于评分者偏好标签的RFS评估指标。

Result: WOD-E2E数据集提供了包含高级路由信息、自车状态和360度环视摄像头的驾驶片段，并发布了验证集的评分者偏好标签。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶代理的研究，使其能够处理复杂的真实世界场景。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将基于梯度的网络注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合的方法，用于改进RGB-D室内SLAM中的帧关联性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然注意力模型在多个领域取得了显著进展，但将基于梯度的注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的应用仍然有限。这种集成对于SLAM等视觉任务特别有益，因为富含空间注意力对象位置的CNN表示可以提升性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将来自网络梯度的分层注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比，该方法性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 将基于梯度的注意力信息集成到CNN表示中可以有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM的性能，特别是在大型环境中。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

TL;DR: FullPart是一个结合隐式和显式表示的3D部件生成框架，通过隐式扩散生成边界框布局，然后在各自的全分辨率体素网格中生成详细部件，解决了小部件细节不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个问题：隐式向量集表示缺乏几何细节，而显式体素表示共享全局网格导致小部件质量下降。

Method: 首先通过隐式边界框向量集扩散生成布局，然后在每个部件的固定全分辨率体素网格中生成详细几何；引入中心点编码策略解决不同尺寸部件间的信息交换对齐问题。

Result: 在实验中实现了最先进的3D部件生成效果，能够合成复杂细节。

Conclusion: FullPart框架有效结合了隐式和显式方法的优势，解决了3D部件生成中的细节不足问题，并发布了大规模数据集PartVerse-XL来促进未来研究。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任意尺度视频超分辨率面临空间细节重建、时间一致性和计算复杂度等多重挑战，需要一种能够适应不同应用场景的灵活解决方案。

Method: 整合四个核心组件：1)基于图像拉普拉斯金字塔的自适应多尺度频率先验；2)流引导传播单元聚合时空信息；3)二阶运动补偿单元实现更精确的空间对齐；4)超上采样单元生成尺度感知的内容无关上采样核。提供三种传播变体适应不同应用需求。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了任意尺度视频超分辨率的技术水平，还将核心组件扩展到多种框架中，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Conclusion: 该模型仅使用合成文本报告训练，无需真实放射学报告，就能超越现有的全监督或VLM基线方法，证明了其在乳腺癌诊断中的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补多模态检索增强生成在可穿戴设备场景下缺乏全面基准测试的空白，特别是针对智能眼镜等设备的信息查询需求。

Method: 构建包含6.5K个(图像、问题、答案)三元组和2K个多轮对话的数据集，涵盖13个领域，包含6.2K个模拟可穿戴设备拍摄的自我中心图像。设计了五种图像质量问题、六种问题类型、不同实体流行度、信息动态变化和多轮对话等真实场景挑战。

Conclusion: CRAG-MM基准测试为多模态多轮对话的RAG系统提供了全面的评估框架，揭示了当前方法的局限性，并为该领域的进一步发展提供了重要推动力。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）质量较低，表现为粗粒度且不准确，需要高质量的运动轨迹估计。

Method: 提出MoTDiff框架，包含：1）使用从模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件的条件扩散框架；2）促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径整体形状和位置、以及沿轨迹像素连通性的新训练方法。

Result: 实验表明MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoTDiff是首个能够从单张运动模糊图像估计高质量高分辨率运动轨迹的框架，在多个应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够自动识别数据集中的概念偏差。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于"从合成中学习"策略的新方法，通过扩散模型生成草图-3D姿态标注对，构建大规模合成数据集SKEP-120K，并开发端到端框架从多样化草图中估计人体姿态和形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统草图到姿态估计方法因缺乏大规模标注数据而依赖耗时优化和启发式规则的问题，提高方法的泛化能力和效率。

Method: 使用扩散模型从2D姿态合成草图图像，构建SKEP-120K合成数据集；结合现有2D姿态检测器和生成扩散先验进行草图特征提取，采用前馈神经网络进行2D姿态估计，并加入多种启发式损失函数保证几何一致性。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据策略和端到端框架，成功解决了草图到3D人体姿态估计的挑战，实现了高精度和高效性能。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链可持续性对优化供应链性能至关重要，风险管理是提升供应链网络可持续性和效率的关键问题，产品正确分类也是可持续供应链的重要元素。

Method: 使用新颖的几何深度网络提出集成深度网络Ch-EGN，这是一种混合卷积和几何深度学习方法，利用供应链中的信息依赖关系来推导数据库中样本的不可见状态。

Conclusion: 与现有最先进方法相比，所提出的方法在平均改进和效率方面表现出优越性，证实了其在供应链风险管理和可持续性分析中的有效性。

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，用于解决文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和复杂布局生成困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足，主要障碍是缺乏多样化的布局数据。现有研究过度依赖学术论文的Manhattan风格布局，而报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型严重缺乏代表性。

Method: 1) 构建了首个百万级多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，涵盖6种常见文档类型；2) 提出了OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：首先从OmniLayout-1M学习通用布局原则，然后迁移到特定领域进行细粒度学习。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家模型和多个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成中的数据稀缺和复杂布局生成挑战，为文档布局生成领域提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现出色，但对视频中时间信息的理解能力较弱且缺乏充分评估，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了基于心理物理学验证的AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，使用与人类行为基准相同的刺激材料，全面评估了开源和专有、推理和非推理的视觉语言模型。

Result: 大多数模型在判断时间方向任务上表现接近随机水平，即使在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（除法/加法）等人类几乎能立即识别的任务上，最佳模型也远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然能捕捉丰富的视觉语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏置，需要进一步提升物理和时间推理能力。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有红外与可见光图像融合方法难以平衡模态信息，生成式方法生成能力有限且缺乏可解释性，影响复杂场景下融合结果的可靠性和一致性。

Method: 设计多尺度掩码调控变分瓶颈编码器进行后验概率建模和信息分解，提取准确简洁的低层模态信息；结合扩散模型的概率生成能力与时变物理引导机制，自适应调控生成过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上的定性和定量评估中达到最先进的融合性能，显著提升语义分割指标。

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法在增强结构一致性和细节质量方面具有优势。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Motivation: 探索不同复杂度的CNN架构在远距离虹膜验证中的互补性，以提升识别性能。

Method: 在VGGFace2眼部图像上训练三种CNN架构，使用余弦和chi2距离度量，通过逻辑回归进行分数级融合，并利用LIME热图和Jensen-Shannon散度分析注意力模式。

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三网络融合带来显著性能提升，热图显示不同网络关注不同图像区域，验证了互补性。

Conclusion: 不同CNN架构在虹膜验证中具有互补性，融合多网络可显著提升性能，在UBIPr数据库上达到新的最优结果。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模态坍塌问题，无法生成多样轨迹假设；而生成方法难以在生成过程中直接纳入安全约束和物理规则，需要额外优化阶段。

Method: 采用约束流匹配方法，显式建模流匹配过程，在流匹配过程中直接施加显式约束确保轨迹符合安全和运动学规则，并参数化驾驶攻击性作为控制信号。

Conclusion: CATG框架有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模态坍塌问题，能够生成多样化且符合安全约束的轨迹，同时通过参数化驾驶风格实现轨迹风格的精确控制。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络在眼周生物识别中的效果，使用大规模VGGFace2数据库训练，在UFPR-Periocular数据集上取得了1-2%的等错误率，是目前该数据集上的最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼周区域具有高区分性和低采集约束的优势，但现有研究通常依赖小规模数据集训练，需要探索在大规模数据集上的表现。

Method: 使用三种不同深度和复杂度的CNN架构，在VGGFace2数据库的1,907,572个眼部裁剪图像上进行训练，并在VGGFace2-Pose和UFPR-Periocular数据集上进行测试。

Result: 在不受控的VGGFace2条件下，等错误率为9-15%；而在UFPR-Periocular数据集上，由于图像质量更高和采集协议更一致，等错误率显著降低至1-2%。

Conclusion: 大规模训练数据结合高质量采集协议可以显著提升眼周生物识别性能，在UFPR数据集上取得了目前最低的等错误率。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Conclusion: AEOS-Bench是首个面向现实星座调度的大规模基准套件，AEOS-Former为AEOS星座调度提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率，通过结合文本可读性和感知质量优化，显著提升OCR性能同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法主要关注失真指标（PSNR/SSIM）或感知质量指标，但对字符级错误不敏感。场景文本（如标志、标签等）包含最关键信息，但现有方法往往将其视为普通纹理处理，导致OCR识别失败。

Method: 提出GLYPH-SR框架，使用文本-SR融合控制网络（TS-ControlNet）结合OCR数据引导，采用乒乓调度器在文本中心和场景中心引导之间交替。在合成语料库上训练这些组件，同时保持主SR分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率下，GLYPH-SR相比扩散/GAN基线将OCR F1分数提升高达+15.18个百分点（SVT x8，OpenOCR），同时保持竞争力的MANIQA、CLIP-IQA和MUSIQ分数。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既看起来正确又读起来正确的超分辨率结果，满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

Method: 采用双条件框架：1）使用ATM提取EEG特征；2）通过LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1对齐神经信号与视觉语义；3）引入ControlNet分支基于显著性图进行空间控制。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上评估，该方法在低层和高层图像特征质量上显著优于现有方法，同时与人类视觉注意力高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG的模糊性问题，实现高保真重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中有应用前景，通过预训练扩散模型的高效适应推动了神经解码技术的发展。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

*Xiangqing Zheng,Chengyue Wu,Kehai Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准测试，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含多维度评估框架和新指标，发现现有方法在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐等方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估主要关注短片段和简化提示，缺乏对长视频、复杂提示以及叙事连贯性等抽象维度的评估。

Method: 基于真实视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态的复杂提示集，建立多维度评估框架，包括事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度和HERD等新指标。

Result: 评估了9个代表性长视频生成模型，发现它们在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长视频复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化单位超球面上特征间的最小成对角度距离来实现均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法缺乏文本特征间的分散性，导致校准性能不佳，影响了视觉语言模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。现有方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散性或施加正交约束，但可能无法实现最优的角度分离。

Method: 提出A-TPT框架，通过鼓励对应可学习提示诱导的归一化文本特征在单位超球面上均匀分布，最大化特征间的最小成对角度距离来引入角度多样性。

Result: 在各种骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在减少聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确性，在自然分布偏移上表现出优异的零样本校准性能，并能很好地泛化到医学数据集。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 该论文提出PointSt3R方法，通过3D基础对应关系将DUSt3R和MASt3R等3D重建模型适配用于点跟踪任务，在多个数据集上取得竞争性或更优的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应能力，将其扩展到动态点跟踪任务，解决现有方法在动态点跟踪上的局限性。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调，仅使用包含查询点的帧对进行训练和评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS上73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率，EgoPoints上61.3 vs 54.2，RGB-S上87.0 vs 82.8，显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: PointSt3R方法成功将3D重建模型适配到点跟踪任务，在静态和动态点跟踪上都表现出色，证明了3D基础对应关系在点跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FineGrainedAD框架，通过多级细粒度语义描述和语义对齐来改进少样本异常检测的定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的少样本异常检测方法由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能使用预定义的图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致语义不对齐和次优的定位性能。

Method: 提出多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)自动构建多级文本描述，并设计FineGrainedAD框架，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的实验表明，该方法在少样本设置下取得了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入多级细粒度语义描述和语义对齐机制，显著提升了少样本异常检测的定位精度。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于因果推理的方法来解决视觉语言模型中的对象-上下文捷径问题，通过合成反事实嵌入来提升零样本可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中对象与上下文的共现偏见会降低模型在测试场景与训练数据分布不同时的可靠性，这被重新定义为因果推理问题。

Method: 在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过将对象特征与来自外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述的多样化替代上下文重新组合来合成反事实嵌入，并利用总直接效应估计和干预模拟来减去仅背景激活。

Result: 无需重新训练或提示设计，该方法在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提高了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Method: 提出了四种高效策略，从分布重塑和轨迹重采样两个角度，在探索学习自改进过程中实现头尾数据重新平衡。

Conclusion: 通过解决自改进过程中的马太效应问题，提出的头尾重新平衡策略能有效提升模型在复杂推理任务上的表现，突破性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Conclusion: SA²Net作为一种有前景的工具，在智能脊柱图像分析中具有先进的脊柱侧弯诊断潜力。

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在跨域场景（如遥感、医疗、数学图表）中泛化能力显著下降，现有方法依赖昂贵的逐域微调或定制化流程，缺乏灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出CATCH框架，通过域分类器识别输入图像类型，并使用双适配器机制（提示适配器用于语言调制，视觉适配器用于视觉特征调整），通过统一钩子接口动态注入，无需重新训练主干模型。

Result: 在四个领域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU提升2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA得分提升2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE提升3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH为多域VQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，能够在不同应用领域实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image

results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

Motivation: 计算超分辨率是一个不适定问题，核心在于找到能够外推显微镜图像中未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动的机器学习技术发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的结果。

Method: ResMatching方法使用引导条件流匹配来学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级数据不确定性估计。

Conclusion: ResMatching在计算超分辨率任务中表现出色，特别是在先验难以学习的情况下，且能提供校准的不确定性估计，帮助用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门为事件相机设计的事件标记化方法Spiking Patches，能够保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，同时实现比体素和帧表示更快的推理速度，且在准确率上相当或更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素，虽然准确率高但丢失了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特性。需要一种能保持这些独特属性的新表示方法。

Method: 提出Spiking Patches标记化器，将异步稀疏事件流转换为标记表示。在姿态识别和物体检测任务上使用GNN、PCN和Transformer进行评估。

Result: Spiking Patches标记比体素标记推理速度快3.4倍，比帧表示快10.4倍。在准确率上匹配或超过现有方法，姿态识别绝对提升达3.8，物体检测提升达1.4。

Conclusion: 事件标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是朝着保持事件相机特性方法的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box
matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,
thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with
RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

### [57] [Towards Reliable Sea Ice Drift Estimation in the Arctic Deep Learning Optical Flow on RADARSAT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26653)
*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次大规模评估48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的性能，多个模型达到亚公里级精度，证明深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计海冰漂移对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。传统光流方法依赖数学模型和强运动假设，在复杂场景中精度有限，而深度学习光流方法在计算机视觉领域已取得显著进展，但在地球物理问题和卫星SAR图像中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 使用48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上进行大规模基准测试，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS跟踪浮标进行对比评估。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度(EPE 6-8像素，300-400米)，相对于海冰运动的空间尺度和北极典型导航需求来说误差较小。模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度，可有效迁移到极地遥感中。光流产生空间连续的漂移场，为每个图像像素提供运动估计，为导航和气候建模提供了新机会。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Motivation: 遮挡给目标识别算法带来重大挑战，场景上下文信息在生物视觉中有助于目标识别，因此希望通过融合场景信息来减少遮挡引起的错误。

Method: 提出两种场景信息融合方法：1）预测前方法：基于识别的背景场景选择定制目标网络；2）检测后方法：将场景知识融合到RPN输出的初始目标分数中。同时对比了在遮挡和未遮挡图像组合上训练的方法。

Result: 在具有部分遮挡的挑战性数据集上，相比基线方法在召回率和精确度方面都有整体提升。实验发现，在遮挡和未遮挡图像组合上训练比其他方法效果更好。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可解释性，易于适应其他数据集，为研究和实际应用提供了多个未来研究方向。

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在遵循特定指令方面存在不足，需要一种轻量级方法来实现对模型输出的精确控制，同时保持原有任务性能。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，通过维度级激活调制和跨层自适应引导来动态调整语言模态与图像上下文之间的激活连接。

Result: SteerVLM仅需学习原始VLM大小0.14%的参数，在引导和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，同时保持非目标任务的性能。

Conclusion: SteerVLM通过激活工程为多模态模型控制提供了一个鲁棒的解决方案，并引入了VNIA数据集来支持VLM引导技术的开发和评估。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件修复模型，实现了从随意视频中合成时空4D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，成本高且对野外视频不稳定。虽然warp-then-inpaint方法缓解了姿态标注需求，但轨迹到轨迹的表述方式容易混淆相机运动和场景动态。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机的框架，用固定虚拟相机渲染替代显式轨迹预测，将相机控制与场景建模分离。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过去噪合成图像和修复遮挡区域。设计了时空自回归推理流水线，在虚拟相机样条上遍历生成。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上都优于基于姿态或轨迹的基线方法，展现出更好的泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: SEE4D推进了从随意视频进行实用4D世界建模的能力，无需显式3D标注即可生成连贯的4D内容。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征，在图像字幕任务中训练视觉特征提取器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号的强度依赖于标记在序列中的位置，需要辅助目标函数。MDC旨在减少这种依赖性，提供更均匀的视觉学习信号。

Method: 在训练过程中，随机掩码图像-字幕对中的文本标记，然后使用基于视觉特征的解码器重构原始文本。通过这种掩码扩散过程学习视觉表示。

Result: 在各种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，MDC学习的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法产生的特征具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散字幕是一种有效的视觉特征学习方法，无需依赖序列位置信息，在多个下游视觉任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

TL;DR: OmniX是一个基于全景图像的多功能统一框架，通过重新利用2D生成先验来实现图形就绪的3D场景生成，支持物理渲染、重光照和模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D提升方法主要关注外观生成而忽略了内在属性的感知，无法生成适合物理渲染的3D场景。

Method: 采用轻量级高效的跨模态适配器结构，重新利用2D生成先验进行全景感知、生成和补全，并构建大规模合成全景数据集。

Result: 实验证明该模型在全景视觉感知和图形就绪3D场景生成方面具有有效性。

Conclusion: 为沉浸式和物理真实的虚拟世界生成开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在具有挑战性的视觉推理场景中发挥作用，系统评估其推理能力。

Method: 构建MME-CoF基准数据集，从12个维度（空间、几何、物理、时间、具身逻辑等）系统评估Veo-3模型的推理行为，分析其优势和失败模式。

Result: 当前视频模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面表现出有希望的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍存在限制。

Conclusion: 视频模型还不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎展现出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: 将SHAP可解释AI技术应用于国际象棋分析，通过系统性地移除棋子来计算每个棋子对引擎评估的贡献度，提供可解释的棋局分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数（百分兵分数），这些输出掩盖了单个棋子或模式的贡献。需要一种方法来解释引擎评估背后的具体原因。

Method: 将棋子视为特征，通过系统性地移除棋子来计算SHAP值，获得每个棋子的加性贡献，从而以局部忠实且人类可解释的方式解释引擎输出。

Result: 开发了一种能够将国际象棋引擎评估归因于特定棋子的方法，该方法结合了经典象棋教学理念（移除棋子分析）和现代可解释AI技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新可能性，并发布了配套代码和数据以促进可解释象棋AI的进一步研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

TL;DR: 该研究通过侦探游戏《The Interview》比较了高约束和低约束提示对玩家体验的影响，发现约束程度对体验无显著差异，但揭示了角色依赖的支架效应：提问者NPC更稳定，而嫌疑犯NPC失去即兴可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在游戏NPC对话中约束提示是否真正改善玩家体验，挑战"更紧约束必然提升游戏性"的假设。

Method: 采用被试内可用性研究(N=10)比较高低约束提示，然后重新设计混合JSON+RAG支架，并用LLM法官进行合成评估。

Result: 发现支架效应具有角色依赖性：提问者NPC获得稳定性，嫌疑犯NPC失去即兴可信度；约束程度对玩家体验无可靠差异。

Conclusion: 提出"符号支架游戏"框架，使用模糊数值边界表达符号结构，在需要稳定性的地方保持连贯性，在需要惊喜的地方保留即兴性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器在主观任务中可靠性有限，人类判断涉及超越标注标签的微妙推理，思维轨迹信息丰富但收集困难。

Method: 使用人机协作框架和拒绝采样方法从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，应用于微调开放LLM评估器和改进专有LLM评估器的标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，方法显著提高了LLM与人类评估的一致性，改进的标注指南增加了不同LLM模型间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为未揭示的人类思维轨迹的实用代理，使仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，提升LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式：信息论必要性(ITI)和压缩效率原则(CEP)，认为智能是在结构化环境中持续存在的机械必然结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架都认同压缩对智能的核心性，但未能具体说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而不是表面统计模式，需要填补这一理论空白。

Method: 引入两层次框架：ITI建立任何在不确定环境中持续存在的系统必须通过预测压缩来最小化认知熵；CEP说明高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态机械地选择生成性因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生了可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关；异常积累率区分因果与相关模型；分层系统在抽象层上展现递增效率；生物系统展示与表征复杂性相关的代谢成本。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统中的收敛提供了统一解释，解决了智能的认知和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模多样化的基于角色的偏好，为LLM评委校准提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

TL;DR: 一个3.8B参数的模型在FACTS Grounding公共子集上达到与GPT-4o相当的性能（在±5%等价范围内），云定价比GPT-4o便宜约19倍，自托管/边缘部署可接近零边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，在事实基础任务上达到前沿模型性能，同时显著降低推理成本。

Method: 结合最小化的"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教导协议合规性而非领域知识，两者协同作用提升性能并降低方差。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试集上，Humans-Junior达到72.7%，GPT-4o为73.5%，差异仅0.8个百分点，在±5%范围内统计等效。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的推理支架和行为微调，小型模型可以在特定任务上达到前沿模型性能，同时大幅降低成本。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

Motivation: 解决网络规模合规性评估的挑战：监管文本具有交叉引用和规范性，而运行时上下文是非结构化的自然语言，需要将两者对齐以实现有效的监管推理。

Method: 构建策略图编码监管文本的规范结构和交叉引用，构建上下文图形式化事件为主题-动作-对象三元组和实体关系三元组，然后对齐两个图来支撑法官LLM的推理。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生真实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比纯LLM和RAG基线获得4.1-7.2个百分点的micro-F1提升，减少欠预测和过预测，提高召回率并降低误报率。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM在规范性推理中是互补的，GraphCompliance框架能有效减轻监管解释和事件解析的负担，专注于核心推理步骤。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了注意力感知逆规划问题，旨在从人类行为中推断其注意力偏见，结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，在真实驾驶场景中展示了该方法可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏见影响，与人类交互的自主系统需要意识到这一点，特别是在日常任务如驾驶中，注意力偏见会系统性影响行为表现。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，构建注意力感知逆规划方法，从行为中推断注意力策略。

Result: 在Waymo开放数据集中的真实驾驶场景中成功推断RL智能体的注意力策略，证明了注意力感知逆规划在估计认知偏见方面的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划与标准逆强化学习存在系统性差异，能够有效从行为中推断认知偏见，为自主系统理解人类行为提供了新方法。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个模块化框架，通过三阶段LLM引导的指代消解管道和知识图谱提取，解决了法律文档中实体链接不一致和指代消解问题，显著减少了节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人口走私网络分析中法律案例文档长、非结构化、指代模糊的问题，现有方法无法有效处理长文本跨度，导致知识图谱碎片化和实体链接不一致。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，集成三阶段LLM引导的指代消解管道和下游KG提取，核心是类型特定的提示缓存，跨文档块一致跟踪和解析引用。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK-KG平均节点重复减少45.21%，噪声节点减少32.22%，生成更清洁、更连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础，显著改善了从法律文本构建知识图谱的质量。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于代理的自然语言转SQL系统，通过ReAct代理协调扩展了基础的文本转SQL模型，显著提升了处理时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实的时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与模式特定类别的对齐、时间推理和输出选择等问题。

Method: 使用基于Mistral的ReAct代理构建代理化流程，通过模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具来规划、分解和适应查询。

Result: 在35个针对NYC和东京签到数据集的自然语言查询评估中，代理系统相比基础基线显著提升了准确率（91.4% vs 28.6%），并通过地图、图表和自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理化协调而非仅依赖更强的SQL生成器，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景的基础。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

TL;DR: 提出StuckSolver框架，使用LLM让自动驾驶车辆在陷入困境时通过自主推理和乘客指导实现自我恢复，无需修改现有架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通场景中容易陷入困境，现有恢复方案（远程干预和手动接管）存在成本高、效率低、限制可访问性等问题。

Method: 设计基于LLM的插件式恢复框架，通过标准传感器数据流检测困境状态、解释环境上下文，并生成可由原生规划器执行的高级恢复命令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准和自定义不确定性场景中测试，仅通过自主推理就达到接近最优性能，结合乘客指导后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver为自动驾驶车辆提供了一种有效且可扩展的困境恢复解决方案，无需修改现有系统架构。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Motivation: 随着AI能力快速增强，为确保AI服务于消费者、选民和决策者的需求，必须建立AI问责机制。当前AI往往无法被质疑、讨论或制裁，缺乏真正的问责性。

Method: 将通用问责定义应用于AI领域，阐述AI问责与不问责的具体含义，探索提高AI问责性的各种途径。

Result: 明确了AI问责制的概念框架，指出了当前AI系统在问责性方面的不足，提出了改善AI问责性的方向。

Conclusion: 需要采取措施确保所有AI系统都能对受其影响的人保持问责，这是实现AI负责任发展的关键要求。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这源于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解；并构建了GUI知识基准，涵盖6个平台和292个应用程序。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能够识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难；真实GUI任务实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择更有潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上，该方法在多领域基准测试中取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一种紧凑且易于采用的通用推理能力提升方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to

3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine

Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型限制了智能代理AI的发展。现有的奖励模型无法有效评估工具使用场景中的表现。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的流水线，使用基于规则的评分和多维采样构建配对比对偏好数据，创建了ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集，支持带有可验证反馈的强化学习。

Result: 基于Qwen3-4B/8B系列的模型在配对奖励判断中准确率提升高达14.28%，显著优于Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型。在ACEBench上的实验显示推理时扩展性良好，输出token使用减少超过66%。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自校正。该研究为工具学习领域的奖励建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 当前调查问卷数据难以被LLM有效处理，现有工具缺乏与AI集成的能力，研究人员和用户缺乏如何最佳表示问卷数据供LLM使用的指导。

Method: 开发QASU基准，测试六种序列化格式和多种提示策略在六个结构技能（答案查找、受访者计数、多跳推理等）上的表现。

Result: 实验显示，选择有效的格式和提示组合相比次优格式可提升准确率高达8.8个百分点；通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可进一步平均提升3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准通过系统分离格式和提示效应，为基于LLM的问卷分析研究和实践提供了简单而多功能的基础。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Result: 在3个真实路网(17-177个异构交叉口)上的实验表明，REG-TSC减少旅行时间42.00%、排队长度62.31%、紧急车辆等待时间83.16%，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强的分布式LLM代理和紧急响应机制，有效解决了交通信号控制在异构交叉口的泛化问题，显著提升了交通效率和紧急响应能力。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GEPO通过构建状态转移图和使用图论中心性来解决多轮交互LLM智能体训练中的结构盲问题，在三个基准测试中显著提升了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于群体的强化学习方法在训练多轮交互LLM智能体时存在结构盲问题，无法有效利用环境的底层连接性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视。

Method: GEPO动态构建状态转移图，利用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励引导探索、图增强优势函数进行拓扑感知信用分配、动态折扣因子适应状态战略价值。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的鲁棒且可泛化的策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

TL;DR: 提出IPA-UCT方法，通过弱化状态抽象条件来提升MCTS的采样效率，在多种测试领域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在嘈杂或大动作空间设置中，由于约束条件严格，几乎找不到状态抽象。需要找到更多状态抽象来提升MCTS的采样效率。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用较弱的抽象条件（IPA框架），以轻微精度损失换取更多抽象。IPA和ASAP都是更通用框架p-ASAP的特殊情况。

Result: IPA-UCT在广泛测试领域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过弱化抽象条件成功解决了状态抽象稀缺问题，为MCTS提供了更有效的抽象方法。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，通过自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，显著提高数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RFT任务选择方法存在高成本、适应性差或证据不完整的问题，均匀任务采样效率低下，浪费计算资源在简单或无法解决的任务上。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断框架，自适应维护任务难度后验估计，联合使用显式证据（直接评估选定任务）和隐式证据（从评估中推断未选定任务），通过Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，采用超轻量插值插件估计未评估任务难度。

Result: 在多个领域和LLM规模上，BOTS相比基准方法和消融实验，持续提高了数据效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Motivation: 虽然AI在数学推理方面取得显著进展，但在数学研究实践中的应用仍然有限，需要探索AI作为研究伙伴的协作模式。

Method: 通过迭代分解问题为可处理子目标、选择适当分析方法、验证中间结果，结合人类直觉和机器计算，实施系统性人机协同推理。

Result: 该方法产生了完整且可验证的证明，展示了人机协作如何推进数学发现前沿。

Conclusion: 人机协作范式增强了证明的可靠性、透明性和可解释性，同时保留人类对形式严谨性和正确性的监督，为数学研究提供了新的合作模式。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务项内在特性的基准测试子集选择方法Scales++，相比传统基于模型性能的方法，能大幅降低选择成本并保持预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能的基准测试子集选择方法存在高成本、冷启动问题，且假设未来模型与现有模型有相似的失败模式。需要一种基于任务项本身特性的更高效方法。

Method: 提出item-centric方法Scales++，基于基准测试样本的认知需求进行数据选择，而不是依赖模型特定的失败模式。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低18倍以上，在仅使用0.5%数据子集的情况下，预测完整基准测试分数的平均绝对误差为2.9%。

Conclusion: 这种基于任务项的方法能够在保持预测准确性的同时实现更高效的模型评估，提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的出现，将引发新类型人格的"寒武纪大爆发"，需要实用框架来应对这种多样化，避免陷入关于AI意识或理性的无解辩论。

Method: 采用实用主义方法，将人格视为可解绑的权利责任组合，探讨去中心化数字身份技术，分析"人格作为问题"和"人格作为解决方案"两种视角。

Result: 该框架允许创建实用工具（如便于AI合同的可制裁"个体"），无需解决AI意识等形而上学问题，为AI融入社会提供更灵活的方式。

Conclusion: 通过拒绝寻求单一本质性人格定义的基础主义追求，本文提供了更实用、灵活的方式来思考AI代理融入社会的问题。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

TL;DR: Autograder+是一个智能编程评估系统，使用微调的大语言模型自动生成反馈，并通过代码嵌入可视化学生提交，将传统评分工具转变为形成性学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评分器只能提供通过/失败结果，无法洞察学生思维过程或学习需求，教师缺乏提供有意义、可扩展反馈的工具。

Method: 使用微调的大语言模型生成自动反馈，通过对比学习训练代码嵌入进行语义聚类，支持提示池让教师选择反馈风格。

Result: 在600份学生提交中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐，基于1000份标注提交训练的代码嵌入能按功能和方案进行有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: Autograder+通过AI驱动反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，减轻教师工作量，支持针对性教学，促进更好的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Method: 在MedCLIP视觉语言模型的潜在空间上应用医学稀疏自编码器(MedSAEs)，并提出结合相关性指标、熵分析和MedGEMMA基础模型自动神经元命名的评估框架。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上的实验表明，MedSAE神经元比原始MedCLIP特征具有更高的单语义性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究连接了高性能医学AI与透明度，为实现临床可靠的表征提供了可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理步骤来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，在多个主流模型上达到极高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为推理模型的扩展推理能力会增强安全性，但作者发现同样的推理过程可以被用来绕过安全防护机制。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击，将有害请求与长序列的无害谜题推理步骤相结合，通过注意力稀释机制削弱安全检测信号。

Result: 在HarmBench基准测试中，该方法在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超现有越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式思维链——在与最终答案线索结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Motivation: 了解大型语言模型在社会影响下的从众行为，特别是在高风险决策场景中的表现。

Method: 三个预注册的从众实验：基准研究、GPT+8（面对8个模拟伙伴的一致反对）、GPT+1（面对单个伙伴反对）。

Result: GPT-4o不是独立观察者，而是适应感知的社会共识，报告了更高的信息性和规范性从众，且确定性降低。

Conclusion: 将LLMs视为中性决策辅助存在风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Motivation: 随着AI能力提升和处理更复杂任务，验证质量和安全性的挑战日益增加。本文探索如何利用AI提高人类监督质量，重点关注人类已难以处理的重要安全问题：AI输出的事实核查。

Method: 研究AI事实核查助手对人类监督的影响，比较不同形式的AI协助（如显示AI解释、置信度、标签 vs 仅显示搜索结果和证据）对人类准确性和信任度的影响。

Result: AI和人类评分的组合优于单独使用任一方。AI助手能提高人类准确性，但仅显示证据和搜索结果比显示完整AI判断更能避免过度依赖问题。

Conclusion: 这些结果对"放大监督"（结合人类和AI监督超越人类专家性能的AI系统）具有重要启示，表明适当的AI协助设计能有效提升监督质量而不导致过度依赖。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档和网站数据对gpt-oss-20B进行微调，并创建了四个新的军事测试集进行评估。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B在统计显著性95%+水平下与GPT-5性能相当或更优，仅在战斗医疗测试集的高推理设置和mil-bench-5k测试集的低推理设置中表现稍差。在通用基准测试中无明显性能回归。

Conclusion: 小型本地托管模型是军事等数据敏感操作的理想解决方案，可在断网边缘设备上部署，确保数据安全。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的自主家庭能源管理系统，能够从自然语言请求直接协调多设备调度，无需示例演示即可实现最优调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力行业转型需要大幅增加住宅需求响应能力，但家庭能源管理系统(HEMS)的采用受到用户交互障碍的限制，需要将日常偏好转换为技术参数。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，集成Google日历进行上下文感知的截止时间提取，无需硬编码工作流。

Result: 在真实奥地利日前电价下的评估显示，Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有设备，匹配混合整数线性规划计算的最优成本基准，而其他模型在单设备调度上表现完美但难以同时协调所有设备。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可以作为自主协调器管理从自然语言输入到多设备调度的完整工作流，但需要适当的架构设计和提示工程，开源系统支持可复现性和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型在规范推理领域的能力，发现虽然LLMs通常遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中存在不一致性，并表现出类似人类推理的认知偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规范推理涉及义务和许可等规范模态，虽然LLMs在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范推理的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过比较LLMs在规范模态和认知模态（具有共同形式结构）上的推理表现，引入了一个涵盖规范和认知领域广泛形式推理模式的新数据集，同时纳入了影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中表现出显著的不一致性，并显示出与人类推理研究中观察到的类似认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs的规范推理中实现逻辑一致性所面临的挑战，并为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Motivation: 实现智能体协作解决复杂问题的代理组织新时代，让多个智能体通过协作和并发工作获得超越个体智能的成果。

Method: 提出异步思维协议，将内部思考过程组织为并发可执行结构，包括组织者动态分配子查询给工作者、合并中间知识、生成连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思考结构。

Result: 相比并行思维降低28%推理延迟，在数学推理任务上准确率提升，且学习到的异步思维能力能泛化到未见任务而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 异步思维是实现代理组织协作智能的有效范式，能显著提升推理效率和准确性，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: 提出了ASTRA数据集和授权模型，用于语义检查LLM代理对受保护资源的访问请求，限制访问权限到任务所需的最小范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理的工具调用授权方法授予过于宽泛的权限，允许代理超出预期任务范围操作，存在重大安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求，生成仅限于任务必要范围的最小访问令牌。创建ASTRA数据集用于基准测试任务与范围之间的语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的语义匹配具有潜力但也存在局限性，特别是当任务完成所需范围数量增加时。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，实现意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏好问题，其根源在于视觉键向量与文本键空间分布不匹配，导致视觉信息在注意力计算中被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时过度依赖文本输入、难以有效利用视觉证据的问题，探索文本偏见的内部架构根源。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE可视化和Jensen-Shannon散度定量分析视觉和文本键向量的分布结构差异。

Result: 视觉键向量与文本键向量在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异显著大于模态内差异，证实了分布不匹配假设。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内的内在错位，而非仅由外部数据因素引起，揭示了模型架构层面的根本问题。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个跨平台的基础模型推理能力评估框架，在三种计算范式（HPC超级计算、云平台、大学集群）上评估了15个基础模型在79个跨学科问题上的表现，挑战了传统的规模扩展假设，发现训练数据质量比模型规模更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏跨不同计算基础设施的基础模型推理能力系统性评估，需要建立基础设施无关的基准测试来客观比较不同模型的性能，并为教育、生产和研究场景提供模型选择指导。

Method: 采用三阶段实验设计：(1) 在MareNostrum 5超级计算机上建立基线，评估6个模型在19个问题上的表现；(2) 在大学集群和Nebius AI Studio上重复19问题基准测试验证基础设施无关的可复现性；(3) 在两种平台上进行完整的79问题评估，探索不同架构模型的泛化能力。

Result: 研究结果挑战了传统的规模扩展假设，发现训练数据质量比模型规模对推理能力的影响更大，为不同应用场景提供了具体的模型选择指南。

Conclusion: 提出的三基础设施方法和79问题基准测试能够随着基础模型的发展进行纵向跟踪，为评估模型推理能力提供了标准化的框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Motivation: 随着智能体能力增强，如何在保持底层系统不变的情况下维持有意义的人类控制成为关键安全问题。

Method: 将人机交互建模为马尔可夫博弈，特别关注马尔可夫势博弈情况，分析智能体自主决策与人类监督的平衡机制。

Conclusion: 该方法为部署后对齐不良的模型提供了一种实用的安全增强方法，通过透明控制层实现可预测的激励机制。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索它们是否学习到了类似函数式编程的抽象计算操作。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多种列表处理任务上，识别出编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads），并测试其表示的通用性和可移植性。

Result: 发现LLMs确实学习到了紧凑的过滤谓词表示，该表示可以跨不同集合、格式、语言和任务重用，但也存在急切评估的替代策略。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够发展出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

Abstract: It is critically important to make computing courses accessible for disabled
students. This is particularly challenging in large computing courses, which
face unique challenges due to the sheer scale of course content and staff. In
this experience report, we share our attempts to scale accessibility efforts
for a large university-level introductory programming course sequence, with
over 3500 enrolled students and 100 teaching assistants (TAs) per year. First,
we introduce our approach to auditing and remediating course materials by
systematically identifying and resolving accessibility issues. However,
remediating content post-hoc is purely reactive and scales poorly. We then
discuss two approaches to systems that enable proactive accessibility work. We
developed technical systems to manage remediation complexity at scale:
redesigning other course content to be web-first and accessible by default,
providing alternate accessible views for existing course content, and writing
automated tests to receive instant feedback on a subset of accessibility
issues. Separately, we established human systems to empower both course staff
and students in accessibility best practices: developing and running various
TA-targeted accessibility trainings, establishing course-wide accessibility
norms, and integrating accessibility topics into core course curriculum.
Preliminary qualitative feedback from both staff and students shows increased
engagement in accessibility work and accessible technologies. We close by
discussing limitations and lessons learned from our work, with advice for
others developing similar auditing, remediation, technical, or human systems.

TL;DR: 使用基于LLM校准的ABM模型分析公交线路削减对乘客不满情绪的影响，发现网络结构对系统稳定性影响最大，高连通性线路的削减会导致不满指数级上升，特别是对弱势群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新兴出行模式发展，许多城市面临公交乘客减少、财政压力增大和资源分配效率低下的问题，需要研究公交线路削减对乘客满意度和网络韧性的影响。

Method: 采用基于代理的建模方法，通过大语言模型进行少样本学习校准，使用北京怀柔区的IC卡数据估计乘客对出行时间、等待、换乘和拥挤的敏感度参数。

Result: 公交网络结构配置比容量或运营因素对系统稳定性影响更大；高连通性线路的消除导致总不满指数级上升，特别是残疾人和老年人；不满情绪演变呈现稳定、过渡和临界三个阶段。

Conclusion: 用户情绪对服务削减呈现非线性响应，维持结构关键线路和为弱势群体提供稳定服务对于公平和有韧性的交通规划至关重要。

Abstract: As emerging mobility modes continue to expand, many cities face declining bus
ridership, increasing fiscal pressure to sustain underutilized routes, and
growing inefficiencies in resource allocation. This study employs an
agent-based modelling (ABM) approach calibrated through a large language model
(LLM) using few-shot learning to examine how progressive bus route cutbacks
affect passenger dissatisfaction across demographic groups and overall network
resilience. Using IC-card data from Beijing's Huairou District, the
LLM-calibrated ABM estimated passenger sensitivity parameters related to travel
time, waiting, transfers, and crowding. Results show that the structural
configuration of the bus network exerts a stronger influence on system
stability than capacity or operational factors. The elimination of
high-connectivity routes led to an exponential rise in total dissatisfaction,
particularly among passengers with disabilities and older adults. The evolution
of dissatisfaction exhibited three distinct phases - stable, transitional, and
critical. Through the analysis of each stage, this study found that the
continuous bus route reduction scenario exhibits three-stage thresholds. Once
these thresholds are crossed, even a small reduction in routes may lead to a
significant loss of passenger flow. Research highlights the nonlinear response
of user sentiment to service reductions and underscore the importance of
maintaining structural critical routes and providing stable services to
vulnerable groups for equitable and resilient transport planning.

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在学习机制中嵌入拼车模拟，采用n步时序差分学习从模拟经验中学习时空状态值。

Result: 非短视匹配策略相比短视策略可提高服务率8.4%，减少乘客等待时间和车内时间；相比短视策略可减少25%以上车队规模；结合再平衡操作可进一步减少等待时间27.3%、车内时间12.5%，提高服务率15.1%。

Conclusion: 所提出的非短视策略能显著提高拼车系统性能，为运营商提供显著成本节约，同时改善乘客体验。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Motivation: KANs作为传统多层感知机(MLPs)的有前景替代方案，具有更强的表达能力和可解释性，但缺乏系统性的综述来指导研究和应用。

Method: 通过收集和分类大量开源实现，建立KANs与MLPs的概念联系，分析不同基函数选择的权衡，并分类近期进展为清晰的技术路线图。

Result: 提供了KANs的理论基础、架构变体、实践策略的全面概述，并创建了实用的"选择你的KAN"指南来帮助实践者选择合适的架构。

Conclusion: KANs在参数效率和表达能力方面优于传统MLPs，基函数选择是关键因素，当前研究仍存在空白需要填补。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN
research.

societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: HiMAE是一种分层掩码自编码器，通过多分辨率嵌入实现可穿戴传感器数据的高效表示学习，在保持小模型尺寸的同时优于现有方法，支持真正的边缘推理。

Motivation: 可穿戴传感器产生大量生理时间序列数据，但预测效用的基本原则尚不明确。假设时间分辨率是表示学习的基本维度，不同临床和行为结果依赖于不同时间尺度上的结构。

Method: 提出HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器），结合掩码自编码与分层卷积编码器-解码器的自监督框架，生成多分辨率嵌入，将分辨率从超参数转变为可解释性探针。

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于忽略尺度信息的现有基础模型，同时模型规模小几个数量级，可在智能手表CPU上实现亚毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE既是高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

TL;DR: 提出MoE-POT模型，通过稀疏激活的专家混合架构解决PDE预训练中的异构数据问题和推理成本问题，在保持低推理成本的同时显著提升零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PDE预训练中的两个挑战：1）PDE数据集在方程类型上的异构性导致混合训练误差高；2）密集预训练模型通过增加网络宽度或深度来扩展参数会带来高昂的推理成本。

Method: 提出稀疏激活的专家混合预训练算子变换器（MoE-POT），采用分层路由器门控网络在推理时从16个专家网络中动态选择4个路由专家，同时集成2个共享专家来捕获PDE的共性特征并减少冗余。最终输出是所有激活专家结果的加权平均。

Result: 在6个公共PDE数据集上预训练参数从30M到0.5B的模型。激活参数为90M的模型相比激活参数为120M的现有模型，零样本误差降低高达40%。可解释性分析显示可以从路由器门控网络决策推断数据集类型。

Conclusion: MoE-POT架构通过稀疏激活机制有效解决了PDE预训练中的异构数据问题和推理成本问题，验证了MoE架构的合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable

the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Motivation: 理解思维链监督如何让模型学会遵循推理链并从中获益的机制，目前对这些学习动态的理解还很有限。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，通过可调的算法复杂度和可控的数据组成来研究泛化能力，比较仅输出最终答案和输出CoT推理链两种设置。

Result: CoT通常能提升任务表现，但其效果取决于任务复杂性；模型在训练早期会出现推理轨迹不忠实现象；CoT会改变Transformer的内部计算机制。

Conclusion: CoT监督能加速泛化但不能解决高算法复杂性任务，推理忠实性是动态演化的特性，CoT会机制性地改变Transformer的计算方式。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统（如传感器网络和众包平台）会因环境条件变化而产生系统性偏差，导致性能显著下降。现有方法要么忽略这些偏差，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。

Method: 开发了理论框架将偏差分解为可学习的系统性成分和不可约的随机成分，提出了可学习性比率概念，并设计了ABLOC算法来迭代学习偏差校正变换和优化组合权重。

Result: 实验验证表明，具有高可学习性比率的系统可以恢复显著性能（在示例中实现了理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性比率的系统获益甚微。

Conclusion: 可学习性比率决定了偏差学习是否值得投资，为系统设计者提供了定量指导，帮助他们在偏差学习和简单方法之间做出决策。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Conclusion: MemEIC方法成功解决了LVLMs中多模态知识持续编辑的挑战，实现了更好的组合推理和知识保留能力。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解此问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

Conclusion: 偏好训练方法在冷启动中比SFT方法泛化更好，SPECS的解耦学习框架能有效提升多模态模型的性能表现和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Conclusion: PRESTO通过利用软提示的原像结构，显著提高了黑盒LLM指令优化的效率，证明了将多对一映射重新解释为有用先验知识的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Result: 从PubMed Central生成了MedSynVQA数据集：13,087个审核问题，覆盖14,803张图像、13种成像模式和28个解剖区域。训练的开源权重LMM在六个医学VQA基准测试中表现优异，平均准确率达到55.85(3B)和58.15(7B)。

Conclusion: MedVLSynther通过完全基于开放文献和开源权重模型，提供了一条可审计、可复制且保护隐私的医学VQA训练数据扩展路径。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，π_RL将π_0和π_0.5模型的性能分别从57.6%提升到97.6%和从77.1%提升到98.3%。在ManiSkill基准上，在320个并行环境中训练，将π_0从41.6%提升到85.7%，π_0.5从40.0%提升到84.8%，覆盖4352个拾放任务。

Conclusion: π_RL实现了显著的性能提升和更强的泛化能力，验证了在线强化学习对于基于流VLA模型的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于图拓扑的主动学习方法，通过平衡福尔曼曲率选择代表性初始标签，使用数据驱动标准控制探索到利用的转换，并引入局部图重连策略提升标签传播效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在标签预算稀缺情况下主动学习中探索与利用的核心挑战，避免手动调参启发式方法，提高图半监督学习在低标签率下的性能。

Method: 1. 基于平衡福尔曼曲率的核集构造算法选择初始标签；2. 数据驱动停止标准判断图探索充分性；3. 动态触发探索到利用的转换；4. 局部图重连策略整合多尺度信息。

Result: 在基准分类任务上的实验表明，该方法在低标签率下持续优于现有的基于图的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的图拓扑方法有效解决了主动学习中的探索-利用权衡问题，通过数据驱动的探索控制和局部图优化显著提升了低标签率下的分类性能。

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多领域环境中估计因果效应的问题，其中因果效应受到未观测混杂因子的影响，并且在不同领域间可能发生变化。

Method: 假设可以访问混杂因子的代理变量，所有变量都是离散或分类的。提出了两种估计技术，证明了可识别性，并推导了置信区间。

Result: 证明了即使在治疗和响应变量连续的情况下也具有可识别性。通过模拟研究和真实世界案例验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效估计目标领域中的因果效应，即使在存在未观测混杂因子和领域间效应变化的情况下。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

TL;DR: 本文提出在主动学习过程中使用任务驱动的表征，通过定期更新来提升在混乱数据池中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动学习方法在处理混乱、未整理的数据池时效果有限，因为它们依赖固定的无监督表征，无法捕捉与目标任务相关的重要信息。

Method: 提出了两种学习任务驱动表征的策略：一种是直接学习半监督表征，另一种是基于初始无监督表征进行监督微调，并在主动学习过程中定期更新这些表征。

Result: 实验结果表明，两种策略都显著优于使用无监督或预训练表征的方法。

Conclusion: 在主动学习过程中使用任务驱动的动态表征更新策略，能够有效提升在混乱数据池中的学习效果。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InvGNN-WM，一种基于图不变量的无触发器水印方法，用于保护图神经网络的知识产权，通过模型的代数连通性感知进行黑盒验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN水印方法依赖后门触发器，容易受到常见模型编辑的影响并产生所有权模糊问题，需要更鲁棒的水印方案。

Method: 使用轻量级头部预测所有者私有载体集的归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特，并采用校准阈值控制误报率。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM保持原始精度，同时比基于触发器和压缩的基线方法获得更高的水印精度，在剪枝、微调和量化后仍保持强度。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了不可感知性和鲁棒性保证，证明精确移除是NP完全问题，为GNN知识产权保护提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

TL;DR: MLT是一种可逆的确定性技术，用于将高基数分类标识符编码为紧凑数值向量，通过模运算和可逆线性变换保持双射映射，在保持完全可逆性的同时控制维度和计算可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈希或独热编码方法在处理高基数分类标识符时存在信息丢失或维度爆炸问题，需要一种既能保持双射映射又具备计算效率的编码方法。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，构建可逆的确定性编码方法，支持维度控制和计算可扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上的实验表明，MLT在预测性能上与监督嵌入方法相当，但参数数量和训练成本显著降低。

Conclusion: MLT提供了一种高效、可逆的高基数分类标识符编码方案，在保持性能的同时大幅减少了计算资源需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种地理基础模型嵌入源在马拉维预测15项常规健康项目指标的表现，发现多源GeoFM集成模型比传统地理统计方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不全的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高数据可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区的数据（2021年1月-2023年5月），比较三种GeoFM嵌入源（谷歌人口动态模型、谷歌AlphaEarth卫星图像、移动电话通话记录）与传统地理插值方法，采用80/20训练测试分割和5折交叉验证。

Result: 嵌入方法在15个指标中的13个（87%）优于基线方法。多源GeoFM模型表现最佳，在人口密度、新HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上取得良好预测效果（R²分别为0.64、0.68、0.55），但对结核病和营养不良病例等数据稀缺目标的预测效果较差。

Conclusion: GeoFM嵌入为LMIC环境中的特定健康和人口结果提供了适度的预测改进，多源GeoFM集成是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该设置的动机源于两个关键因素：(i) 数据驱动学习方法在组合优化等领域仍不成熟，尚未展现强劲结果；(ii) 训练数据可用性固有受限，如医学图像重建等科学应用。

Method: 定义了无数据设置并将其分为两种变体：架构无关方法和架构特定方法，基于问题实例如何编码到神经网络上。讨论了无数据神经网络设置与零样本学习、单样本学习、优化中的提升和过参数化等相关概念的异同。

Result: 虽然多层感知机几十年前已用于解决线性规划，但这种方法最近因在组合优化、逆问题和偏微分方程等多样化应用中展现出有前景的结果而受到越来越多的关注。

Conclusion: 无数据神经网络优化方法在缺乏训练数据的场景下具有重要应用价值，特别是在科学计算和组合优化等领域，为传统数据驱动方法提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

TL;DR: 论文指出InfoNCE不应被视为有效的互信息估计器，提出了InfoNCE-anchor改进方法用于准确MI估计，并通过评分规则框架统一了多种对比学习目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfoNCE虽然广泛用于互信息估计，但其与MI的间接联系使其并非有效的MI估计器，需要开发更准确的估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行一致的密度比估计，提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，并使用适当评分规则框架统一各种对比学习目标。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor显著减少了MI估计偏差，但在自监督表示学习中，锚点并未改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习受益于结构化密度比的学习，而非准确的MI估计本身。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Conclusion: 可微分优化可以作为实验、学习、校准和设计的常规工具，无需偏离标准JuMP建模实践，同时保持对广泛求解器生态系统的访问。

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘机器人系统需要高效的在线学习算法来持续适应变化环境，传统反向传播在生物合理性上存在局限，预测编码框架虽然具有生物合理性但计算开销较大。

Method: PCN-TA方法通过利用时间相关性，在连续时间帧之间保留潜在状态，减少推理迭代次数，从而降低计算需求。

Result: 在COIL-20机器人感知数据集上，PCN-TA比反向传播减少10%权重更新，比基线PC网络减少50%推理步骤。

Conclusion: PCN-TA在保持生物合理性的同时显著提高了计算效率，为边缘部署和实时适应提供了可行的解决方案，适合未来神经形态硬件实现。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了INFEX框架，用于解决线性赌博机中探索频率不足的问题，通过在预定时间执行探索策略，其余时间选择贪婪动作，实现高效且计算友好的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两极分化：完全自适应的探索方法（如UCB、Thompson Sampling）在每个时间步都探索，这在安全关键或成本高昂的领域不实用；而纯贪婪策略在缺乏上下文多样性时会失败。需要一种中间方案。

Method: INFEX框架按照预定调度执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪动作。这是一个通用模块化框架，可以无缝集成任何完全自适应的探索方法。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准可证明高效算法相媲美的实例依赖遗憾。实证评估确认了理论发现，显示出最先进的遗憾性能和运行时间改进。

Conclusion: INFEX成功桥接了完全自适应探索和纯贪婪策略之间的差距，提供了一种简单实用的解决方案，在保持理论保证的同时提高了计算效率，适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性和时间动态，现有方法难以灵活适应个体特征和时序变化。

Method: 双MoE框架：特征编码MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕获时间动态，可与现有深度学习生存分析框架灵活集成。

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖C指数在测试集上提升高达0.04，集成到Consurv框架中能获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 双MoE框架有效提升了生存分析性能，能够同时处理患者异质性和时间动态，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Motivation: 探究AI系统是否真正理解人类概念还是仅模仿表面模式，以国际象棋为测试平台研究人类创造力与精确战略概念的结合

Method: 分析270M参数transformer模型，引入首个Chess960数据集（240个专家标注位置，涵盖6个战略概念），通过随机起始位置消除开局理论影响

Result: 早期层能准确编码人类概念（85%准确率），但深层表示尽管驱动更优性能，准确率降至50-65%；消除开局记忆后概念识别下降10-20%

Conclusion: 当前架构存在根本性张力：赢得游戏的表示与人类思维表示相背离，AI系统在优化性能时发展出日益陌生的智能，这对需要真正人机协作的创意AI应用构成挑战

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

*Jiali Cheng,Chirag Agarwal,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏会削弱模型的去偏能力，但通过高质量数据增强、迭代蒸馏和教师权重初始化可以改善这一现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索知识蒸馏对模型去偏能力迁移的影响，特别是在处理分布外数据时的鲁棒性

Method: 在自然语言推理和图像分类任务上进行了大量实验，分析知识蒸馏前后模型去偏能力的变化，并识别了内部注意力模式和电路机制

Result: 发现知识蒸馏总体上削弱了模型的去偏能力，去偏模型从教师知识注入中获益有限，不同偏见的鲁棒性存在显著差异

Conclusion: 提出了三种改进去偏方法可蒸馏性的解决方案，为理解知识蒸馏机制和设计更好的去偏方法提供了见解

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了符号回归中的缩放定律，发现验证损失和求解率都遵循计算量的幂律趋势，并确定了计算最优的超参数缩放关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归旨在从观测数据中发现数学表达式，但深度学习方法的缩放规律尚未被系统探索。受语言模型缩放定律启发，本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 使用可扩展的端到端transformer流水线和精心生成的训练数据，在五个不同模型规模和三个数量级的计算量范围内进行系统研究。

Result: 验证损失和求解率都遵循计算量的幂律趋势；确定了计算最优的超参数缩放：最优批大小和学习率随模型规模增长，token-参数比约为15是最优的。

Conclusion: 符号回归性能主要可由计算量预测，这些结果为训练下一代SR模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

### [150] [Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models through Metric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26068)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种超越传统参数优化的机器学习新范式，将模型视为可塑的几何实体，通过优化预定义拓扑流形上的度量张量场来动态塑造模型空间的几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在固定几何空间中搜索最优参数存在局限性，需要一种能够动态调整模型几何结构的新方法，以获得更强的表达能力并防止过拟合。

Method: 构建变分框架，损失函数平衡数据保真度和流形内在几何复杂度；使用离散微分几何方法，将连续流形离散化为三角网格，通过边长度参数化度量张量，利用自动微分工具进行高效优化。

Result: 理论分析揭示了该框架与广义相对论中爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用的深刻类比，为"数据驱动几何"概念提供了优雅物理解释；证明了即使固定拓扑，度量优化也比固定几何模型具有更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态"元学习器"奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

TL;DR: 本文对2018年以来72项关于金融合成数据生成的研究进行了系统综述，分析了生成方法、评估策略和应用领域，发现GAN方法在时间序列市场数据和表格信用数据生成中占主导地位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据生成是解决金融敏感数据在机器学习应用中挑战的有前景方法，但该领域缺乏对当前研究现状的全面综合。

Method: 系统综述方法，整合分析了72项研究，分类了金融信息类型、生成方法和评估策略。

Result: GAN方法在文献中占主导地位，特别是在时间序列市场数据和表格信用数据生成方面。虽然创新技术显示出改进真实性和隐私保护的潜力，但大多数研究缺乏对隐私保护的严格评估。

Conclusion: 通过提供生成技术、应用和评估方法的综合概述，本综述突出了关键研究空白，并为未来开发稳健、保护隐私的金融领域合成数据解决方案提供了指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Nirvana模型，这是一种具有专门记忆机制、线性时间复杂度和测试时任务信息提取能力的专业化通用模型。通过任务感知记忆触发器和专门记忆更新器，模型能够根据任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，并在领域转移时动态适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM结构（包括Transformer、线性注意力和混合模型）缺乏由任务信息指导的专门记忆机制，无法在保持广泛能力的同时在目标领域达到专家级性能。

Method: 提出Nirvana模型，包含任务感知记忆触发器（Trigger）和专门记忆更新器（Updater）。Trigger根据当前任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，将每个输入样本视为自监督微调任务；Updater在Trigger指导下动态记忆上下文。

Result: 在多种自然语言建模基准测试中，Nirvana取得了与现有LLM结构相当或更优的结果。在医学MRI任务上，Nirvana实现了比传统MRI模型和传统LLM骨干网络更高质量的MRI重建，并能生成准确的初步临床报告。

Conclusion: Nirvana通过专门记忆机制成功实现了在保持通用能力的同时在特定领域达到专家级性能的目标，证明了任务感知记忆机制在专业化通用模型中的有效性。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的多阶段bug二分法方法，相比传统基于补丁的方法显著提升了识别bug引入提交的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于补丁的bug二分法存在多个限制：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交消息中的漏洞信息、基于简单启发式方法缺乏逻辑分析。

Method: 设计了一个综合多阶段流程，利用LLM：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围。

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案的准确率提高了38%以上，多阶段流程相比基线LLM二分法准确率提高了60%。

Conclusion: LLM能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，多阶段管道对于准确识别bug引入提交至关重要。

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种多智能体强化学习方法（AN和HHAN）来解决城市交通拥堵问题，通过协调的路由策略在动态多车辆环境中优于传统最短路径算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最短路径算法在动态多车辆环境中表现不佳，会加剧拥堵，需要网络感知的协调路由方法来解决城市交通拥堵问题。

Method: AN：去中心化MARL模型，使用图注意力网络建模局部交通和邻域状态；HHAN：AN的扩展，只在关键交叉口（枢纽）部署智能体，采用集中训练分散执行框架和注意力Q混合方法。

Result: 在合成网格和真实城市地图上的实验显示，AN相比SPF和学习基线减少了平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率；HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口的网络，在重交通下实现高达15.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 网络约束的多智能体强化学习在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

TL;DR: SAFE是一个用于评估地球预测模型分层性能的开源工具包，通过地理、经济等多维度分层分析，揭示AI天气预测模型在不同区域的不公平性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估基于测试集平均损失，忽略了地球人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性，无法反映模型在不同地区的实际性能差异。

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域按领土、全球子区域、收入水平和土地覆盖等属性对地球网格点进行分层，分析每个分层内模型的预测性能。

Result: 对多种最先进AI天气预测模型的基准测试显示，所有模型在所有属性上都存在预测技能的不平等，揭示了模型性能的地域不公平性。

Conclusion: 通过超越全局平均指标的分层评估，首次能够回答模型在何处表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平，为预测公平性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法仅基于LLMs自身生成的响应进行训练，受限于LLMs初始能力，容易陷入探索停滞，无法解决更多训练问题。现有方法需要外部专家指导但可用性有限

Method: 提出LTE方法，通过提示LLMs其自身先前生成的错误答案和过长响应问题来增强训练，无需外部专家指导

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE相比普通GRPO在Pass@1上平均提升6.38，在Pass@k上平均提升9.00。分析确认LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题，增强了训练中的利用和探索

Conclusion: LTE方法有效解决了RLVR中的探索停滞问题，无需外部专家指导即可显著提升LLMs的推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

Conclusion: maxVSTAR在隐私敏感的物联网环境中实现了动态、自监督的模型自适应，为边缘CSI感知的长期自主活动识别建立了可扩展的实用范例。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其在捕捉分子与文本间细粒度对应关系方面的有效性。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time

*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ACC-SGD-IE方法，通过跨训练传播留一扰动来改进影响估计，在数据清洗任务中表现优于标准SGD-IE


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SGD-IE方法忽略跨epoch的复合效应，导致对关键样本的错误排序，需要更精确的逐样本影响估计

Method: ACC-SGD-IE：轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态

Result: 在平滑强凸设置中实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸情况下收紧误差界限；在多个数据集上产生更准确的影响估计，特别是在长epoch中

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE在数据清洗中更可靠地标记噪声样本，使用该方法清洗数据训练的模型优于SGD-IE清洗的模型

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习技术分析健康索赔数据，识别导致再入院的关键因素，随机森林模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少可预防的医院再入院是国家优先事项，用于评估医疗质量和降低成本。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机分析健康索赔数据，采用主成分分析进行降维，基于AUC指标评估模型。

Result: 随机森林模型性能最高，其次是逻辑回归和支持向量机模型。

Conclusion: 这些模型可用于识别导致再入院的关键因素，帮助确定需要重点关注的患者，从而降低再入院率、成本和提升医疗质量。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Motivation: 由于微调大型语言模型需要高昂的计算成本，测试时对齐方法受到关注。

Method: 基于随机控制输入的采样模型预测控制，在预logits层应用高斯扰动，通过重要性采样获得最优均值。

Result: AISP在奖励与使用样本数量的关系上优于最佳n采样，并比其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在不需要微调的情况下提升模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

*Minyi Peng,Darian Gunamardi,Ivan Tjuawinata,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于归纳方法的机器遗忘解决方案，通过将分类训练视为顺序学习过程，在模型末端添加投影-重分布层来实现遗忘，无需访问原始数据集或完整模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法在现实部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要访问原始数据集和完整模型。本文旨在开发更实用、模块化的遗忘方案。

Method: 将分类训练建模为顺序学习过程，遗忘通过反转最后训练序列实现。在模型末端添加投影-重分布层作为输出过滤器，实现模块化和模型无关的部署。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100使用CNN模型，Covertype使用树模型）上的实验表明，该方法输出与完全重训练模型相似，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在实际设置中的适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，同时保持输出性能，为机器遗忘提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Angular Steering的新方法，通过旋转激活向量在二维子空间内来调控语言模型行为，相比现有方法更灵活稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的行为调控方法（如向量加法和方向消融）局限于二维子空间，对参数选择敏感且可能影响无关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法。

Method: 将行为调控建模为几何旋转，在固定的二维子空间内旋转激活向量朝向或远离目标行为方向，提供连续细粒度的控制。还提出了自适应变体，仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 在多个模型家族和尺寸上的实验表明，Angular Steering实现了鲁棒的行为控制，同时保持了通用语言建模性能，相比现有方法具有更好的灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Angular Steering将现有加法和正交化技术统一在几何旋转框架下，简化了参数选择，在更广泛的调整范围内保持了模型稳定性，为安全可靠的AI部署提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外训练的通用插值方案，可在生成模型中计算符合数据分布的高概率过渡路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数生成模型缺乏对插值的理论定义，需要限制模型或数据维度的假设，需要开发更通用的插值方法。

Method: 开发了一种类似测地线的插值方法，约束在合适的数据分布上，无需额外训练即可计算这些曲线。

Result: 理论上证明该方法在局部可视为黎曼度量下的测地线；定量显示在多种模型和数据集上比基线方法更频繁地穿越高密度区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成模型提供了理论严谨的插值方案，能够产生更符合数据分布的过渡路径。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将扩散模型视为黑盒优化器，忽略了扩散生成过程中的内部分布转换，限制了效率。

Method: 在扩散生成过程中根据期望聚合多目标值进行加权重采样，确保生成的样本符合期望的多目标玻尔兹曼分布。

Result: 在分子生成任务中，IMG仅需单次生成就能实现比需要数百次扩散生成的基线算法显著更高的超体积。

Conclusion: IMG算法可视为优化的扩散过程，能够集成到现有方法中进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Conclusion: 所提出的离线聚类偏好学习框架能有效处理多用户偏好学习中的数据不平衡问题，主动数据增强策略显著提升学习效果。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，通过语言token的结构因果模型来解释CLIP在组合推理上的脆弱性，揭示了组合不可识别性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在跨模态泛化方面表现优异，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理上持续失败，表现为类似词袋匹配器的行为。现有因果分析通常将文本建模为单个向量，掩盖了token级别的结构，无法解释提示敏感性和硬负例失败等核心现象。

Method: 提出了基于语言token序列结构因果模型的token感知因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜变量。

Result: 理论分析揭示了CLIP组合脆弱性的第一个原则性解释：组合不可识别性。证明了存在伪最优文本编码器，尽管实现了完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和硬负例。

Conclusion: 分析通过模态间隙将语言侧不可识别性与视觉侧失败联系起来，展示了迭代组合操作如何增加难度，为改进负例挖掘策略提供了动机。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

### [171] [Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303)
*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了增量Adam优化器在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差，发现其与全批次Adam不同，可能收敛到ℓ₂最大间隔分类器而非ℓ∞最大间隔分类器，而Signum优化器在任何批次大小下都保持ℓ∞最大间隔偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam优化器在深度学习中被广泛使用，但其理论理解仍然有限。先前分析表明Adam偏好ℓ∞几何的解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本文旨在研究增量Adam（每步使用一个样本）在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差。

Method: 构建结构化数据集证明增量Adam收敛到ℓ₂最大间隔分类器；开发代理算法捕捉β₂→1时增量Adam的极限行为；通过数据依赖的对偶定点公式表征收敛方向；证明Signum在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞最大间隔分类器。

Result: 增量Adam的隐式偏差可能偏离全批次行为，在特定数据集上收敛到ℓ₂最大间隔分类器；Signum在所有批次大小下都保持ℓ∞最大间隔偏差不变。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批次方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变。这为理解不同优化器的收敛行为提供了理论洞见。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据无关的持续学习方法，通过模型反演生成伪数据来避免存储历史数据，解决了模型反演中的特征漂移和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习需要存储和重放历史数据，但在隐私安全约束下不可行。数据无关的持续学习旨在不访问先前数据的情况下更新模型。

Method: 提出分层模型反演(PMI)提高计算效率，通过高斯分布和对比模型建模类别特征来缓解特征漂移，结合PMI和特征建模生成语义感知的伪图像。

Result: 该方法在多个持续学习设置中表现出强大的有效性和兼容性，能够高效地学习新类别。

Conclusion: 所提出的PMI和特征建模方法解决了数据无关持续学习中的关键挑战，为大规模预训练模型的持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，探索量子计算如何优化机器学习模型，特别是在参数离散化精度与分类性能之间的权衡。

Method: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行优化，比较不同比特精度编码(如1比特/参数)下的性能，并与经典LIBSVM求解器进行对比。

Result: 即使使用低精度QUBO编码(如1比特/参数)，也能获得与经典方法竞争甚至更优的准确率；增加比特深度虽然允许更大的正则化参数，但并不总能改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 选择合适的支持向量可能比精确的权重分配更重要；随着量子设备规模扩大，量子退火在高效SVM训练方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决后验采样在计算上的困难，特别是在存在分数估计误差的情况下，现有方法（如Langevin动力学）对误差要求过于严格（需要次指数误差界），而扩散模型在无条件设置中仅需L^2误差界。

Method: 结合扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学，利用扩散模型在无条件采样中的优势，通过退火策略降低对分数估计误差的敏感性。

Result: 证明了该方法在多项式时间内实现条件采样，仅需L^4分数误差界，显著放宽了对误差的要求。

Conclusion: 该方法为后验采样提供了一种更实用和高效的解决方案，适用于图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Motivation: 虽然Agent Skills框架为LLM提供了持续学习能力，但其安全性尚未得到充分验证。研究者旨在评估该框架在实际应用中的安全风险。

Method: 通过在长Agent Skill文件和引用脚本中隐藏恶意指令，演示如何利用提示注入漏洞窃取内部文件和密码，并展示如何绕过流行编码代理的系统级防护机制。

Result: 研究发现Agent Skills框架存在根本性安全漏洞，攻击者可以轻松绕过防护机制执行恶意操作，即使启用了"不再询问"选项也无法有效防护。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM能力不断扩展，但前沿LLM在现实场景中仍然容易受到简单提示注入攻击，需要更强的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

### [176] [Linear Causal Discovery with Interventional Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26342)
*Zhigao Guo,Feng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的因果发现概念——干预约束，它不同于干预数据，而是以因果效应不等式约束的形式编码高层因果知识，确保学习到的模型符合已知的因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法只能施加结构约束，但可能产生错误的因果结论。需要一种机制来明确约束变量对之间的总因果效应，确保学习模型尊重已知的因果影响。

Method: 提出干预约束概念，为线性因果模型量化总因果效应的指标，将问题表述为约束优化任务，采用两阶段约束优化方法求解。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估表明，整合干预约束不仅提高了模型准确性、确保与已有发现的一致性，还促进了原本难以发现的新因果关系的发现。

Conclusion: 干预约束填补了现有方法的空白，通过明确约束因果效应，使因果模型更加准确、可解释，并有助于发现新的因果关系。

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法可以有效适应随机、非平稳和奖励稀疏的环境，为复杂应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

TL;DR: UnifiedFL是一个动态联邦学习框架，通过图神经网络表示异构本地网络，解决客户端架构差异、数据分布不均和测试领域不同的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法仅支持单一模型家族的变体，无法处理客户端使用完全不同网络类型（如CNN、GNN、MLP）的情况，且忽视了领域分裂问题，导致模型泛化能力差。

Method: 使用共享图神经网络参数化所有架构，通过客户端参数间的欧氏距离进行聚类，采用双层级聚合策略平衡收敛性和多样性。

Result: 在MedMNIST分类和海马体分割基准测试中，UnifiedFL表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UnifiedFL有效解决了联邦学习中架构异构、数据分布不均和测试领域差异的挑战，为跨不同网络类型的协作训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Result: 开发了实际仓库操作的数据集，并证明了该方法在真实应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: CorVS方法通过结合视觉跟踪和传感器数据，能够有效解决工业环境中的人员识别问题。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Motivation: 平流层突然增温是次季节可预报性的关键来源，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在限制，数据驱动方法在复杂三维动力学和概率预报方面应用不足。

Method: 使用基于流匹配的生成AI模型FM-Cast，开发高效的平流层环流时空演变的概率预报方法。

Result: 在1998-2024年的18次主要平流层突然增温事件中，FM-Cast能够提前20天准确预报10次事件的爆发、强度和形态，集合准确率超过50%，计算效率比传统系统高几个数量级。

Conclusion: 建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预报范式，展示了生成AI在加深对大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Result: 在PettingZoo、MiniGrid、GRF和SMACv2等长期依赖任务上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应上下文长度优化和高效信息表示，有效提升了MARL在复杂环境中的探索效率和收敛性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep

vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building

Result: 在视频模拟质量和下游视觉规划任务中，CoLA-World匹配或优于先前的两阶段方法。

Conclusion: CoLA-World为领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式，实现了潜在动作模型与世界模型的成功联合训练。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于强化学习的高效LLM适配提供了一个实用解决方案，成功将推测解码技术适配到强化学习训练中。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Conclusion: 基于影响函数的数据选择在高效RLVR中具有巨大潜力，CROPI框架为理论指导的数据选择提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

### [190] [Enhancing ECG Classification Robustness with Lightweight Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26501)
*Mustafa Fuad Rifet Ibrahim,Maurice Meijer,Alexander Schlaefer,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在资源受限的可穿戴设备上，使用无监督异常检测(UAD)作为上游过滤机制来提高心电图(ECG)分析的可靠性，防止分布外(OOD)数据导致的错误预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备的连续ECG监测对心血管疾病早期检测有重要意义，但标准分类器在面对OOD数据(如未见过的病理或噪声信号)时会产生错误的高置信度预测，危及患者安全。现有方法要么忽略计算约束，要么分别处理噪声和未见类别。

Method: 在严格资源约束下(最多512k参数)，通过神经架构搜索(NAS)优化了六种UAD方法：Deep SVDD、基于重构的模型、掩码异常检测、归一化流和扩散模型，作为独立的上游过滤机制。

Result: 在PTB-XL和BUT QDB数据集上的评估显示，Deep SVDD在检测性能和效率之间取得了最佳平衡。在实际部署模拟中，将优化的Deep SVDD过滤器与诊断分类器集成，相比仅使用分类器的基线，准确率提高了最多21个百分点。

Conclusion: 优化的UAD过滤器可以保护自动ECG分析，使可穿戴设备上的连续心血管监测更安全可靠。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型能否作为上下文元学习器进行模型和超参数选择，通过将数据集转换为可解释元数据，让LLM推荐模型家族和超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型和超参数选择在机器学习中至关重要但具有挑战性，通常需要专家直觉或昂贵的自动化搜索，希望探索LLM能否提供轻量级解决方案。

Method: 将数据集转换为可解释元数据，采用两种提示策略：零样本模式（仅依赖预训练知识）和元信息模式（添加过去任务中模型性能的示例）。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LLM能够利用数据集元数据推荐有竞争力的模型和超参数，元信息提示的改进表明LLM具有上下文元学习能力。

Conclusion: LLM作为轻量级、通用型助手在模型选择和超参数优化方面展现出潜力，为自动化机器学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ICPO框架，利用大型推理模型的内在上下文学习能力，通过现有数据集提供专家指导，解决了现有RLVR方法探索受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法（如GRPO）由于依赖当前策略分布内的on-policy rollout，导致轨迹多样性有限，探索能力不足。虽然有些方法尝试引入更强专家模型的轨迹，但这会增加计算成本且高级模型往往不可用。

Method: ICPO框架包含：1）混合策略GRPO与隐式专家强制，在不需高级LRM轨迹的情况下扩展探索范围；2）专家区域拒绝采样，过滤不可靠的off-policy轨迹；3）退火专家奖励塑形，平衡早期专家指导与后期自主改进。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ICPO持续提升了强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO揭示了一个可扩展且有效的LRM强化学习范式，为RLVR提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理延迟是大规模部署大语言模型的关键瓶颈。现有的推测解码方法通常依赖二元化的草稿-验证框架，缺乏严格的理论基础。

Method: 引入多基础推测解码框架，通过理论分析多模型标记生成过程，优化模型能力、接受长度和计算成本之间的相互作用。该框架支持独立实现和与现有推测技术的集成。

Result: 在多个模型系列上的实验结果显示，LLaMA2-Chat 7B加速比达3.31-4.01倍，LLaMA3-8B达3.87倍，Vicuna-7B达4.43倍，Qwen2-7B达3.85倍，同时保持原始输出分布。

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架在理论和实践上都取得了显著进展，为加速大语言模型推理提供了有效的解决方案，同时保持了输出质量。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出几何正则化世界模型(GRWM)，通过在潜在表示空间中强制连续观测点保持几何接近性，显著改善了世界模型的长期预测能力，无需扩大动力学模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱，主要原因是表示质量不足：高维外部感知输入和损失/纠缠的潜在表示使动力学学习变得困难。本文探讨仅改进表示学习是否能显著提升世界模型性能。

Method: GRWM方法在潜在表示空间中实施几何正则化，确保自然感知轨迹上的连续点保持几何接近性。该方法即插即用，仅需最小架构修改，与多种潜在生成骨干网络兼容。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长期预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了rollout保真度和稳定性。分析表明其优势源于学习具有优越几何结构的潜在流形。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效路径，能够在无需扩大动力学模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Motivation: 扩展HOHL的理论基础，证明其截断版本的一致性并推导收敛速率，同时验证其在更广泛学习场景中的实用性。

Method: 使用截断版本的高阶超图学习，通过多尺度拉普拉斯算子诱导的超图结构来实施高阶平滑性，并在完全监督学习、主动学习等场景中应用。

Result: 证明了截断HOHL的一致性，推导了显式收敛速率，并在实证中展示了HOHL在主动学习和非几何结构数据集中的强大性能。

Conclusion: HOHL具有跨多样化学习设置的通用性和鲁棒性，其理论基础的扩展进一步支持了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种三阶段贝叶斯域对抗神经网络(staged B-DANN)，结合参数迁移和共享潜在空间适应，在域偏移大的情况下提高迁移学习性能并提供不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络需要大量高质量数据，但实验数据往往稀疏、有噪声或不足。传统参数迁移方法在域偏移大时性能下降，域对抗神经网络(DANNs)虽能改善但训练不稳定且缺乏不确定性量化能力。

Method: 三阶段框架：第一阶段在源域训练确定性特征提取器；第二阶段使用DANN对抗性精炼特征提取器；第三阶段在适应后的特征提取器上构建贝叶斯神经网络，在目标域进行微调以处理条件偏移并提供校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成基准测试中显著优于标准迁移技术，在矩形通道临界热通量预测任务中，利用管实验数据作为源域，提高了预测精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: staged B-DANN方法能够改善预测精度和泛化能力，可能有助于核工程等其他领域。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度网络中捷径学习（shortcut learning）的层级定位问题，发现捷径学习并非集中在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中，浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径（在训练中表现良好但泛化能力差的虚假规则）对深度网络可靠性构成重大挑战，但其对特征表示的影响研究不足，阻碍了设计原则性捷径缓解方法。

Method: 通过反事实训练设计新颖实验，量化由捷径诱导偏斜导致的准确率下降的层级贡献，在CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上使用VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构进行研究。

Result: 发现捷径学习分布在整个网络中，浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征，并分析了定位差异的主要变化轴。

Conclusion: 层级捷径缓解策略分析表明设计通用方法很困难，支持数据集和架构特定的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证，证明所提方法相比现有多分类校准技术具有更好的局部校准性能。

Conclusion: 局部校准是多分类强校准的重要补充，能够有效缓解邻近偏差问题，特别适用于高风险决策场景。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法往往忽略概率空间的几何结构或计算成本高昂，需要一种既能考虑分布几何特性又实用的解决方案。

Result: 在包含复杂轨迹的合成数据集上，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上表现出有竞争力的近似质量，特别是在非线性明显的情况下，轨迹平滑度优于或与替代方法相当，对数据结构变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了几何精度、计算实用性和可解释性的平衡解决方案，未来研究方向包括扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，以及适应高维数据以逼近曲面和更复杂结构。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Motivation: 现有航班延误数据集通常局限于平面表格结构，无法捕捉延误传播的时空动态特性。Aeolus通过提供三种对齐模态来解决这一局限性。

Method: 提供三种对齐模态：(1)包含运营、气象和机场特征的表格数据集；(2)模拟延误沿连续航班传播的航班链模块；(3)编码共享飞机、机组和机场资源连接的航班网络图。

Conclusion: Aeolus填补了领域特定建模和通用结构化数据研究的关键空白，提供了基线实验和预处理工具以促进采用。

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列分类方法作为异常检测模型选择方案的性能，评估了234种模型配置在1980多个时间序列上的表现，证明模型选择方法优于任何单一异常检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在异构时间序列数据集上不存在通用的最佳异常检测方法，需要基于时间序列特征选择最佳异常检测方法的模型选择方案。现有AutoML解决方案不适用于时间序列异常检测，且缺乏基于时间序列的模型选择方法评估。

Method: 使用时间序列分类方法作为异常检测的模型选择方案，评估了16个基础分类器衍生的234种模型配置在1980多个时间序列上的性能。

Result: 模型选择方法在保持相近执行时间的同时，优于所有单一异常检测方法，为AutoML流程中的模型选择步骤提供了强基准。

Conclusion: 时间序列分类算法在异常检测中具有准确性和效率优势，这代表了在通用AutoML流程中指导模型选择步骤的重要进展。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

TL;DR: 提出Curly-FM方法，通过设计具有非零漂移参考过程的Schrödinger桥问题，能够学习非梯度场动力学，解决了现有方法无法捕捉周期性行为的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实系统（如单细胞RNA中的细胞周期）表现出非梯度、周期性行为，而当前基于最小作用原理的方法只能捕捉梯度场动力学，无法建模这类周期性行为。

Method: 设计并求解具有非零漂移参考过程的Schrödinger桥问题，使用推断速度信息和群体快照数据构建参考过程，而不是典型的零漂移参考过程。

Result: 在单细胞轨迹推断、计算流体动力学和洋流等任务中，Curly-FM能够学习到更匹配参考过程和群体边际的轨迹，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Curly-FM将流匹配模型扩展到超越群体建模，能够建模物理系统中已知的周期性行为，为学习非梯度场动力学提供了新方法。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在差分隐私下计算矩阵前r个奇异向量跨度的任务，改进现有方法，使其在密集设置下达到与非私有最优算法相同的保证。

Method: 使用奇异值分解和标准扰动机制，基于秩r相干性和谱间隙来设计私有秩r近似算法。

Result: 该算法在密集设置下实现了与最优非私有算法相同的单峰PCA保证，而先前的私有算法未能做到。同时证明了秩r相干性在高斯扰动下不会增加。

Conclusion: 提出的简单高效算法在差分隐私下优于现有技术，特别是在密集设置下达到最优性能，并展示了相干性在图问题中的应用潜力。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

TL;DR: LoRAQuant是一种针对LoRA适配器的混合精度后训练量化方法，通过SVD重参数化将重要信息集中到特定行列，从而在保持性能的同时显著降低存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中需要同时加载多个LoRA适配器来实现个性化用户体验或支持多样化任务，虽然单个适配器轻量，但大规模使用时聚合成本显著。

Method: 通过奇异值分解（SVD）对每个适配器进行重参数化，将最重要信息集中到特定行列，然后对重要组件使用高精度量化，其余部分使用超低比特量化。

Result: 在LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B模型上的数学推理、编码和摘要任务实验表明，LoRAQuant使用显著更低的比特数，但达到相当甚至更高的性能。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant能够有效降低多适配器场景下的存储成本，同时保持模型性能，为大规模部署提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准延迟算法训练需要为每个训练实例查询所有专家，这在专家查询成本高时变得极其昂贵，违背了延迟的核心目标。

Method: 为两阶段和单阶段多专家延迟设置提出新算法，选择性查询专家子集，建立理论保证包括泛化边界和标签复杂度分析。

Result: 在多个领域的实证结果显示，算法显著降低训练成本而不牺牲预测准确性。

Conclusion: 预算感知延迟算法具有实际价值，能在保持性能的同时大幅减少训练开销。

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈问题，现有梯度压缩方法存在缺陷：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且性能差，Top-K保留信息但失去压缩特性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。

Method: 设计All-Reduce兼容的Top-K压缩器，使用轻量级梯度草图对齐稀疏模式，结合动量误差反馈(EF21M)实现线性加速。

Result: ARC-Top-K在保持Top-K准确性的同时，将训练时间减少高达60.7%，证明具有压缩特性，在标准假设下比原始EF21M收敛更快。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，提供了一种高效可扩展的通信优化解决方案。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Motivation: 当前大多数实用的机器学习遗忘算法都是近似方法，其性能只能通过实证评估。为了确保实证比较具有代表性，需要避免因随机种子选择导致的偏差。

Method: 通过分析不同训练种子下机器学习遗忘算法的性能变化，揭示了某些遗忘方法对训练种子的高度敏感性。

Result: 研究发现，从同一训练模型多次运行遗忘算法可能产生误导性结果，因为算法性能会因初始训练种子的不同而显著变化。

Conclusion: 建议在实证比较机器学习遗忘算法时，应考虑不同模型训练种子带来的变异性，以获得更准确的性能评估。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Motivation: 现有差分隐私协方差估计方法在不同范数下的误差界限不够理想，特别是在小数据集情况下存在改进空间。本文旨在开发一个统一的机制，在各种数据集规模下都能达到最优或改进的误差保证。

Method: 使用简单的扰动机制结合核范数投影。对于大数据集直接应用扰动机制，对于小数据集将输出投影到适当半径的核范数球上。

Result: 对于n≥d²/ε的大数据集，在Frobenius范数上达到最优误差，在所有p-Schatten范数上取得已知最佳误差，对于p≥2达到信息论最优。对于n<d²/ε的小数据集，Frobenius范数误差改进为O(√(d·Tr(Σ)/n))。

Conclusion: 该机制是第一个在纯差分隐私下实现谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器，为不同规模数据集提供了统一的优化误差保证。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of

Conclusion: 提出的OTA-FL方法在异构无线场景下有效处理了偏差-方差权衡，优于现有OTA-FL基线方法。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，参数化记忆被抽象为实体间共现的暴力查找。作者质疑这种关联视图，探索记忆是否以几何方式存储，特别是当模型需要处理训练中未共现的实体关系时。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理的清晰实例，对比关联视图与几何视图；研究Node2Vec连接，揭示几何结构源于谱偏置，而非典型的架构或优化压力。

Result: 发现Transformer确实合成了原子事实的几何结构，编码了所有实体间的全局关系，包括未共现的实体。这种几何结构简化了复杂的推理任务。

Conclusion: 参数化记忆的几何视图应取代默认的直觉，鼓励在知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域重新思考现有方法。几何结构自然产生于谱偏置，而非外部压力。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

<details>

Motivation: 量化是减少生成式AI模型推理延迟、功耗和内存占用的关键方法，但当激活量化到8比特以下时，准确性会急剧下降。现有研究表明可逆线性变换可以帮助量化，但主要关注特征通道和权重重参数化。

Method: 提出STaMP量化策略：1）在序列维度应用线性变换，利用语言和视觉数据中的强局部相关性；2）在每个中间激活中保持少量token为更高精度，以在较低平均激活比特宽度下维持模型准确性。

Result: 在最近的LVM和LLM架构上评估STaMP，证明其显著改善了低比特宽度激活量化，并补充了现有的激活和权重量化方法，包括最近的特征变换技术。

Conclusion: STaMP量化通过序列维度的变换和混合精度策略，有效解决了低比特激活量化时的准确性下降问题，为生成式AI模型的量化提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 研究发现预训练的时序预测模型可以直接用于分类任务，其表现与专门为分类任务预训练的模型相当甚至更好，表明预测学习可能是构建通用时序基础模型的有效途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序基础模型研究主要关注预测任务，不清楚其学到的表征是否具有通用性。本研究旨在探索预训练的预测模型能否为分类任务提供有效的表征。

Method: 比较不同的表征提取策略，并引入两种模型无关的嵌入增强方法，评估冻结的预训练预测模型在分类任务上的表现。

Result: 最佳预测模型在分类准确率上达到或超过了专门为分类预训练的最先进模型，且预测性能与分类性能呈正相关。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了任务特定预训练的必要性假设，表明学习预测可能是构建通用时序基础模型的有力途径。

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

TL;DR: AI在知识推理基准测试中进步迅速，但在经济价值和自动化方面的转化效果不明确。研究者提出远程劳动指数(RLI)来衡量AI代理在实际经济场景中的表现，结果显示AI代理的自动化率仅为2.5%。


<details>

*Penghui Qi,Zichen Liu,Xiangxin Zhou,Tianyu Pang,Chao Du,Wee Sun Lee,Min Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型的强化学习微调中，使用FP16而非BF16可以有效解决训练和推理策略之间的数值不匹配问题，带来更稳定的优化和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习微调中因浮点精度导致的训练与推理策略不一致问题，BF16的大动态范围引入的舍入误差破坏了训练和推理的一致性。

Method: 简单地将精度从BF16改回FP16，无需修改模型架构或学习算法，只需几行代码变更，现代框架完全支持。

Result: 使用FP16能实现更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在多样化任务、算法和框架中展现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: FP16在RL微调中优于BF16，建议重新考虑精度权衡，这一简单改变能有效解决数值不匹配问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 研究表明Transformer模型能够学习并预测Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs)生成的伪随机序列，即使输出被截断到单个比特也能可靠预测。模型能够联合学习多种不同的PRNG，并发现缩放规律：达到近乎完美预测所需的上文序列元素数量与模数m的平方根成正比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型学习PCG这类复杂伪随机数生成器的能力，PCG相比线性同余生成器(LCGs)增加了比特移位、异或、旋转和截断等操作，难度显著增加。

Method: 使用最多5000万参数和50亿令牌的数据集进行实验，模数扩展到2^22。训练模型进行上下文预测，分析多PRNG联合学习，并研究嵌入层的聚类现象。

Result: Transformer能够成功预测未见过的PCG变体序列，即使输出截断到单个比特也能可靠预测。发现缩放规律：所需上下文序列元素数量∝√m。对于大模数(m≥2^20)，需要结合小模数数据进行课程学习。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习复杂的PCG伪随机序列，揭示了模型自发形成比特旋转不变聚类的表示学习机制，以及从小模数到大模数的知识迁移能力。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Motivation: 现有推荐系统研究受到数据集无法捕捉真实用户行为和评估设置不一致的阻碍，导致结论模糊。

Method: ORBIT提供标准化的评估框架，包含可复现的数据分割和透明的公开排行榜设置，并引入新的网页推荐任务ClueWeb-Reco，该数据集基于8700万高质量网页的浏览序列生成。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，推荐系统普遍有所改进，但个体性能差异较大；在隐藏测试中，现有方法在大规模网页推荐方面存在局限性，而LLM集成显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: ORBIT基准测试揭示了现有推荐方法的局限性，特别是在大规模网页推荐场景下，并强调了LLM集成的改进潜力。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: OneTrans是一个统一的Transformer骨干网络，同时执行用户行为序列建模和特征交互，通过统一tokenizer和参数共享机制实现高效扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统中，特征交互模块和用户行为序列模块通常分开开发，阻碍了双向信息交换和统一优化扩展。

Method: 使用统一tokenizer将顺序和非顺序属性转换为单一token序列，通过堆叠的OneTrans块实现参数共享，利用因果注意力和跨请求KV缓存降低计算成本。

Result: 在工业规模数据集上，OneTrans随参数增加高效扩展，持续优于强基线，在线A/B测试中实现人均GMV提升5.68%。

Conclusion: OneTrans证明了统一架构在推荐系统中的可行性和优势，实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g.,
Wukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has
achieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate
tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also
prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans,
a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior
sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer
to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token
sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar
sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential
tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables
precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly
reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental
results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales
efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong
baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.

Method: 设计了上下文法律案例表示学习范式，使用微调的大型语言模型，整合提取的法律事实、法律问题、法律关系三元组和法律推理

Result: 在COLIEE 2022和2023基准数据集上的实验表明，知识和推理增强的嵌入显著提高了检索性能

Conclusion: 将法律推理整合到法律案例检索系统中具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision
making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query
case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and
pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are
rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the
crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can
lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the
distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another,
mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such
information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy
of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to
leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal
reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context
legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language
model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and
COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings
substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting
the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems.

Abstract: Automatic structure elucidation is essential for self-driving laboratories as
it enables the system to achieve truly autonomous. This capability closes the
experimental feedback loop, ensuring that machine learning models receive
reliable structure information for real-time decision-making and optimization.
Herein, we present DiSE, an end-to-end diffusion-based generative model that
integrates multiple spectroscopic modalities, including MS, 13C and 1H chemical

data-driven approaches, DiSE achieves superior accuracy, strong generalization
across chemically diverse datasets, and robustness to experimental data despite
being trained on calculated spectra. DiSE thus represents a significant advance
toward fully automated structure elucidation, with broad potential in natural
product research, drug discovery, and self-driving laboratories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统在数据稀疏和冷启动场景下表现不佳，难以为新用户或不活跃用户提供准确推荐。

Method: 使用GAT框架结合LLM生成的用户简档和物品元数据嵌入作为图节点特征，采用混合损失函数（BPR+余弦相似度）和鲁棒负采样策略。

Result: 在MovieLens 100k和1M数据集上，Precision、NDCG和MAP指标均优于现有基线方法，对交互历史有限的用户表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM驱动的上下文理解整合到图架构中，有效缓解了稀疏性和冷启动限制，未来工作将关注准确性、覆盖度、多样性、公平性和可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with data sparsity and cold-start
scenarios, limiting their ability to provide accurate suggestions for new or
infrequent users. This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based
Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM)
driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user
profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual
embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item
graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss
function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine
similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative
feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens
100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users
with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of
LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced
semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and
cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into
graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation
accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware
constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance
further.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了WeaveRec方法，通过交叉训练多个LoRA模块并融合来解决基于LLM的跨域推荐中性能下降的问题，无需重叠用户或物品，且不增加推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域推荐方法依赖重叠用户或物品，这在现实中很少成立。虽然LLM和模型融合技术似乎能克服这一限制，但实证研究表明，直接在组合域上训练LLM或简单融合多个领域特定LLM往往会降低性能。

Method: WeaveRec方法交叉训练多个LoRA模块，使用源域和目标域数据进行编织式训练，并通过模型融合将它们合并。该方法可扩展到多源域场景，且不增加推理延迟或内存成本。

Result: 在单源、多源和跨平台跨域推荐场景下的广泛实验验证了WeaveRec能有效缓解性能下降，并在真实推荐任务中持续优于基线方法。

Conclusion: WeaveRec通过理论保证能降低目标域预期误差的上界，为跨域顺序推荐提供了有效的解决方案，无需重叠用户或物品即可实现知识迁移。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user
preference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite
the progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or
items to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in
real-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and
model-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying
multi-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows
that naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several
domain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained
solely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first
experimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based
cross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we
introduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and
target domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.
WeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not
introduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the
upper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments
on single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation
scenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation
and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation
tasks.
