In particular,\nthese new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM\ncategories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential\nobjects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new\ncompositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,\nmeaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on\nthis completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,\na ``set-like\" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential\nobjects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization\nof backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos\narchitecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u751f\u6210AI\u67b6\u6784\uff08GAIAs\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6784\u9020\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684LLM\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7ebf\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u62c9\u56de\u3001\u63a8\u51fa\u3001\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\u7b49\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684LLM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u8303\u7574\u7684\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u8303\u7574\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u62d3\u6251\uff08\u201c\u7c7b\u96c6\u5408\u201d\u8303\u7574\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u4e3aLLM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although existing methods have demonstrated\npromising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional\nmotif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif\ninteractions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose\nan Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for\n\\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from\nboth global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules\ninto functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are\ncombined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,\nstarting from the local structure representation.

Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local\nquality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for\nenhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.\nTo achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison\nNetwork (CCN).

The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block\n(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a\nComprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can\nupdate the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive\ncomparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of\ncandidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since\nroutes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model\nmust be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an\ninterpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability.

To overcome\nthe communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,\ndecentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)\ncommunication, has been extensively explored in the research community.\nAlthough researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model\nconvergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost\nalong with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These\ncosts are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each\ntraining round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.\nFurthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments\naffects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity\ndegrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the\ndesign of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose\nHat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated\nlearning (DFL) framework.

These devices, often powered by energy-efficient\nmicrocontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep\nlearning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation\nof IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a\ncompelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way\nfor efficient and real-time processing at the edge.

Rather than prompting the\nLLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically\nrich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment\nbetween a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input\ncomplexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver\nfine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode\nmatch.

To tackle this, we\nintroduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote\nsensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in\nriver networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality\nseries and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally\nadaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A\ncross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns\nwith spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and\nsite-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet\ncaptures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations.

While the framework is rooted in Machine\nEthics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by\noutlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action\nunder time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is\nnot constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive\ndeliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled\nmanner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the\nconceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a\nmoral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support\nreal-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative\nreasoning.

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates\nconflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when\ninequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study\nand reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based\non the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality\naffects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the\nRENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the\neffectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based\napproaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more\nversus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to\neviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results\ndemonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed\nthrough individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area\nwith concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in\nthe prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of\ndeployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk.

However, existing FL\nframeworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and\nthe growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers\nfrom high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with\nlarge models.

The gap mainly stems from the\ndiscrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)\nsynthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on\nimages with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely\ndegraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a\nnaive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to\nsimulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this\nwork, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to\nresolve specific gaps.

However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such\ncomplex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under\nand following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively\ncaptured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and\ncalibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for\nPredicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict\nboth the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block\nlevel under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.\nGuided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal\nattention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory\nguides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation\ndynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention\nmodule for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a\nregularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs\nsignificantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial\nland use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%\nimprovement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided\nmodules was further validated through ablation studies.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new\nopportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches\nfrequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,\nmulti-dimensional evaluation frameworks.\n  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art\nopen-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by\nstructured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from\nexample-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and\ndomain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework\nfeatures a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated\ndata across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy\npreservation.\n  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,\nCirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt\nengineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with\nrule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM\nestablishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with\nrobust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is\nboth clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more\neffective data sharing in healthcare research.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynLLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u752820\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u533b\u7597\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6210\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSynLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u752820\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff08\u5982LLaMA\u3001Mistral\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u89c4\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89c4\u5219\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cLLM\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "SynLLM\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cLLM\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u533b\u7597\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u3002"}}

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass\nhuman experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing\nperformance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we\naggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,\nhuman groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM\npredictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd.

Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical\nautoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into\nopen-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the\nVDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive\nvideo generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from\ndifferent domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to\nblend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to\nuser prompts.

To resolve these\nchallenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model\nthat overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both\nframe-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting\nat the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal\ngradient correction (OGC) module.

Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a\ntask-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first\nembeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt\nfeatures, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the\nframe prompt features to the video prompt.

However, vision-language knowledge\ndistillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust\ngeneralization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,\nwhich are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting\nsuch large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in\nreal-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the\nentanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose\nAligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming\nto achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies\nentropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal\ndata (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,\nconducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.\nThis enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while\nrequiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can\nserve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language\ndistillation frameworks.

However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly\npenalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to\nidentical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable\nlatent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

However, semantic classification\napplications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role\nlabeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain\nexperts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they\ntypically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from\nlatency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification\ntasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by\nfinetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language\nmodels).\n  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt\nsmall language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and\nfinetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging\ntask-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of\nthe pretrained weights unchanged.

However, ultrasound deformable registration\nremains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently\nlow contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images\nseverely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.\nExisting methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical\ninterpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware\ndeformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages\nsynchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical\nprior to constrain the registration.

Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the\nperceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution\nscreen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the\nbanding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that\nthe existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are\nlimited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding\ndynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed\nLIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different\ncompression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective\nopinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the\nvalue of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that\ndetect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.\nAmong these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)\nvideo quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of\nthe learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep\nneural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding\nprediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous\nstate-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,\nCBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video\ndebanding models.

Existing deep segmentation\nnetworks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,\noverlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous\n(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often\nsuffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,\nexperts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying\nconfidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,\nambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure\nsub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold\nfrom the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert\nannotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into\nlow-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted\nloss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive\nconfidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold\nof ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors\nin boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary\nExpected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens\nstructure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that\nour ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across\ndifferent deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method\nsurpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction\nin lens structure segmentation under U-Net.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward\nmodels (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human\nvalues, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical\nfor effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer\nlimited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are\ninflexible toward user preference shifts.

The reliance on\nsuch conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,\nand challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,\nwe empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2\nlatent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while\npreserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for\nestimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity\npreservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters\nwe have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that\ncan be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,\nor systems for detection of synthetic images.

Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm\nresults in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel\nfeatures should not vary for the same category in different images. To address\nthis dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that\nexplicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class\nrepresentations and spatial image features.

This\ndivision of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining\nbroad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing\nagents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks\nshow that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary\nbaselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,\nwhich demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy\ninformation-seeking tasks at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "BrowseMaster\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212-\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u5e7f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89c4\u5212-\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u5236\u5b9a\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5173\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u4e2d\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cBrowseComp-en\u5f97\u520630.0\uff0cBrowseComp-zh\u5f97\u520646.5\u3002", "conclusion": "BrowseMaster\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

This field-driven organization sharpens\nclass boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.\nExperiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive\nembeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRAVITY\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u9876\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u9876\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0cGRAVITY\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9876\u70b9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53d7\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u9876\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u52bf\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGRAVITY\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u5bfc\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u9876\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "GRAVITY\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u529b\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9876\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods, whether\ntraining-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining\nsubject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame\ninteraction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field\nmakes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the\nsubject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby\nhindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout\nconditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively\nfacilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens\nthe consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise\ncontrol over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.\nBuilding on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable\nStorytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout\nconditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout\nannotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1\nmillion 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300\nhours of cartoon videos.

In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language.

To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards.

These\nmethods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance\ncomponents, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving\nperfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be\nquite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In\nthis paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals\n(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our\ninvestigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also\ncauses enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately\nreducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose\na novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the\ndecomposition and enhancement stage.

For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices.

Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro.

Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the\nlack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body\nhuman captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT\ndataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view\nOne-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes\nHDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment\nmaps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of\nstate-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both\nthe dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling\ncomplex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions.
