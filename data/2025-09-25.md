### [1] [Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles in Off-Road Environment Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19378)
*Nelson Alves Ferreira Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非铺装道路和越野环境的自动驾驶感知系统，通过可配置模块化分割网络（CMSNet）框架实现实时障碍物和可通行地面分割，并发布了包含近12,000张图像的新数据集Kamino。

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

### [2] [Overview of LifeCLEF Plant Identification task 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19402)
*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何利用植物标本馆的数字化标本数据来改进热带地区植物自动识别系统，通过跨域分类任务评估了从标本图像到野外照片的迁移学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前植物自动识别系统主要基于北美和西欧的野外照片数据，而生物多样性最丰富的热带地区数据稀缺。但植物标本馆收藏了大量热带植物标本，这些数字化资源可用于改进数据稀缺地区的植物识别。

Method: 设计了一个跨域分类任务，训练集包含数十万份植物标本馆数字化标本和数千张野外照片，测试集仅包含野外照片，旨在学习从标本图像到野外照片的域映射。

Result: 通过LifeCLEF 2020植物识别挑战赛评估了不同研究团队的方法，验证了利用标本馆数据改进热带地区植物自动识别的可行性。

Conclusion: 植物标本馆的数字化标本资源可以有效弥补热带地区野外照片数据的不足，为生物多样性丰富但数据稀缺地区的植物自动识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with
more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only
concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America
and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity
such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists
have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in
herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the
biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of
digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or
"PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated
identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the
use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species
mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one
of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated
as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several
hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning
a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of
photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the
conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the
participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [3] [iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552)
*Manyi Yao,Bingbing Zhuang,Sparsh Garg,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Christian Shelton,Manmohan Chandraker,Abhishek Aich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFinder是一个结构化的语义基础框架，通过将行车记录仪视频转换为层次化、可解释的数据结构，将感知与推理解耦，从而在零样本驾驶视频理解任务中显著优于端到端的视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在通用任务上训练，缺乏结构化归纳偏置，在领域特定任务（如行车记录仪视频分析）中存在困难。现有视觉语言模型在空间推理、因果推断和事件可解释性方面表现不佳。

Method: iFinder采用模块化、无需训练的流程，使用预训练视觉模型提取关键线索（物体姿态、车道位置、物体轨迹），并组织成帧级和视频级结构。结合三块提示策略，实现逐步、基础化的推理。

Result: 在四个公开行车记录仪视频基准测试中，iFinder显著优于端到端视觉语言模型，事故推理准确率提升高达39%。

Conclusion: 通过将大型语言模型与驾驶领域特定表示相结合，iFinder为零样本、可解释且可靠的行车记录仪视频理解提供了替代方案。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc
dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose
training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole
modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing
video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,
causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,
we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples
perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,
interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,
training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract
critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which
are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined
with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning
for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.
Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's
proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and
global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot
driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By
grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a
zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for
post-hoc driving video understanding.

### [4] [CURE: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure for Facial Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19562)
*Fnu Shivam,Nima Najafzadeh,Yenumula Reddy,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CURE是首个用于人脸识别系统的无监督遗忘框架，无需身份标签即可有效移除目标样本，同时保持整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸识别系统存在隐私问题，需要数据删除功能。现有机器遗忘技术依赖监督方法需要身份标签，但在隐私受限或大规模噪声数据集中往往不可用。

Method: 提出了CURE框架，使用基于质心的无监督表示擦除方法，无需身份标签即可实现选择性遗忘。同时提出了新的评估指标UES来平衡遗忘和保留稳定性。

Result: CURE在无监督遗忘方面显著优于现有方法的无监督变体。通过将低质量图像指定为遗忘集，展示了质量感知遗忘的可行性和优势。

Conclusion: CURE填补了无监督机器遗忘的关键空白，证明了图像质量在机器遗忘中的重要性，为人脸识别系统的隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant
utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological
infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy
concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine
unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by
selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models
while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine
unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring
identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations
or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce
CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first
unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates
without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while
preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning
Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,
addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly
outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,
we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the
forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role
of image quality in machine unlearning.

### [5] [Synthesizing Artifact Dataset for Pixel-level Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589)
*Dennis Menn,Feng Liang,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过自动注入伪影到干净合成图像的方法，无需人工标注即可训练伪影检测器，相比基线方法在ConvNeXt和Swin-T上分别提升13.2%和3.7%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪影检测器需要昂贵的人工像素级标注，缺乏标注数据限制了检测器性能，而传统的伪标注方法存在噪声标签问题

Method: 设计伪影污染流程，在预定义区域自动向高质量合成图像注入伪影，自动生成像素级标注而不需要人工标注

Result: 在人工标注数据上验证，该方法训练的伪影检测器相比基线方法在ConvNeXt和Swin-T上分别提升13.2%和3.7%的性能

Conclusion: 这是向可扩展像素级伪影标注数据集迈出的第一步，将世界知识整合到伪影检测中

Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of
image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These
detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and
aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive
pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of
annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive
pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate
unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To
address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically
injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined
region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The
proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves
performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified
on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an
initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that
integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

### [6] [Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Progressive Task-Specific Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19602)
*Neeraj Gangwar,Anshuka Rangi,Rishabh Deshmukh,Holakou Rahmanian,Yesh Dattatreya,Nickvash Kani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式任务特定的多任务适配方法，通过在前几层共享适配器模块，在后几层逐渐增加任务特异性，以减少任务冲突并提高参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参数高效微调方法在多任务学习中面临的任务干扰和负迁移问题，由于可训练参数有限，这些问题在多任务学习中更加严重。

Method: 在预训练模型中引入适配器模块，初始层共享所有任务，后续层逐渐增加任务特异性；提出基于梯度的任务相似性计算方法，将相似任务分配到共享适配器模块。

Result: 在PASCAL和NYUD-v2数据集上的实验表明，该方法仅需五分之一的可训练参数就能超越完全微调的多任务模型，并在参数效率多任务学习方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 渐进式任务特定适配方法有效解决了多任务学习中的任务冲突问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现了更好的性能提升。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution
for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these
methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task
learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative
transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these
issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces
adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared
across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more
task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts
among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial
layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.
Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task
similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter
modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the
pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense
prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while
requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves
better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art
methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

### [7] [Raw-JPEG Adapter: Efficient Raw Image Compression with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19624)
*Mahmoud Afifi,Ran Zhang,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出RawJPEG Adapter，一种轻量级、可学习且可逆的预处理管道，将原始图像适配为标准JPEG压缩，通过空间和可选频域变换实现高保真原始数据重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始数据保留完整传感器信息但存储需求大，JPEG格式压缩效率高但不适合原始数据存储，需要一种能在压缩效率和原始数据保真度之间取得平衡的解决方案。

Method: 采用可学习的空间和可选频域变换预处理原始图像，压缩参数存储在JPEG注释字段中，实现可逆的原始数据重建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法比直接JPEG存储具有更高的保真度，支持其他编解码器，并在压缩比和重建精度之间提供了有利的权衡。

Conclusion: RawJPEG Adapter为原始图像存储提供了一种实用的解决方案，在保持高压缩效率的同时实现了准确的原始数据重建。

Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which
the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw
data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision
tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making
them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely
supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility,
but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter,
a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw
images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional
frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment
field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple
datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG
storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between
compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

*William L. Muckelroy III,Mohammed Alsakabi,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了更高容量的分割主干网络对4D雷达生成LiDAR式点云质量的影响，发现最优分割主干能比现有技术提升23.7%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR成本高昂限制了高级自动驾驶系统的广泛采用，需要寻找替代方案。已有研究使用4D雷达生成LiDAR式点云，但需要优化网络架构

Method: 通过实验研究不同容量的分割主干网络对点云生成质量的影响，使用模块化2D CNN主干和时序一致性网络

Result: 研究发现过高容量的模型反而会损害性能，但最优分割主干能实现23.7%的性能提升

Conclusion: 选择合适的网络容量对4D雷达生成LiDAR式点云至关重要，存在一个最优容量点能显著提升性能

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

### [9] [Bias in the Picture: Benchmarking VLMs with Social-Cue News Images and LLM-as-Judge Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19659)
*Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了针对大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）社会偏见问题的研究，创建了一个包含1,343个新闻图像-问题对的基准测试集，评估了多种先进VLMs在人口属性（年龄、性别、种族、职业等）上的偏见表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然能够联合理解图像和文本，但容易吸收和再现有害的社会刻板印象，特别是在涉及年龄、性别、种族、服装、职业等视觉线索时。

Method: 构建新闻图像基准测试集，使用大型语言模型作为评判者进行人工验证，评估多种先进VLMs在人口属性上的偏见表现。

Result: 研究发现：（i）视觉上下文在开放设置中系统性影响模型输出；（ii）不同属性和模型的偏见流行程度不同，性别和职业风险最高；（iii）更高的忠实度不一定对应更低的偏见。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了VLMs存在的社会偏见问题，发布了基准测试提示、评估标准和代码，支持可复现和公平感知的多模态评估。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text,
but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes
when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are
present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark
consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we
annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender,
race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and
employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our
findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in
open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models,
with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher
faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the
benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and
fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

### [10] [MoTiC: Momentum Tightness and Contrast for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19664)
*Zeyu He,Shuai Huang,Yuwu Lu,Ming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MoTiC框架，通过贝叶斯分析将新类先验与旧类统计对齐，结合大规模对比学习和动量自监督，减少FSCIL中新类原型的估计偏差，提高增量学习鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FSCIL中新类原型因数据稀缺导致的估计偏差问题，同时缓解灾难性遗忘和过拟合。

Method: 使用贝叶斯分析对齐新类先验与旧类统计，结合大规模对比学习增强特征紧密度，集成动量自监督和虚拟类别构建MoTiC框架。

Result: 在三个FSCIL基准测试中取得最先进性能，特别是在细粒度任务CUB-200上表现优异。

Conclusion: MoTiC框架能有效减少估计偏差，提高增量学习鲁棒性，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用机器学习方法解决高分辨率遥感数据中的云和云阴影检测问题，比较了传统方法和深度学习架构的性能，发现深度学习模型特别是UNet和SCAN在检测质量上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效的云和云阴影检测是准确反演大气甲烷浓度等痕量气体的关键前提，对于MethaneSAT和MethaneAIR等任务尤为重要，因为云和云阴影会偏置甲烷反演结果并影响排放量化。

Method: 部署和评估了传统方法（迭代逻辑回归ILR和多层感知器MLP）与先进深度学习架构（UNet和光谱通道注意力网络SCAN），在MethaneSAT数据上进行对比分析。

Result: 传统方法在空间一致性和边界定义方面表现不佳，而深度学习模型显著改善检测质量：UNet在保持空间结构方面表现最佳，SCAN在捕捉精细边界细节方面更优，特别是在MethaneSAT数据上SCAN超越了UNet。

Conclusion: 深度学习架构为云和云阴影筛查提供了稳健、可扩展的解决方案，能够增强现有和下一代高光谱任务的甲烷排放量化能力，光谱注意力机制的引入对卫星特定特征具有重要价值。

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在特征图中存在结构化噪声，影响了分割和深度估计等下游应用的效果

Method: Structured Token Augmentation (STA)通过空间扰动增强token多样性；Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)在transformer层间应用可学习的在线去噪

Result: 在ImageNet、Ade20k和NYUv2等标准基准测试中，视觉质量和任务性能均得到一致提升

Conclusion: 提出的方法具有架构无关性，能够有效改善ViT的特征图质量，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a
wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in
their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and
depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques-
Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to
improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token
diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies
learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are
architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including
ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements
in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical
effectiveness of our approach.

*Ling Lo,Kelvin C. K. Chan,Wen-Huang Cheng,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过引入逐帧引导来扩展现有模型的方法，实现平滑一致的属性过渡，并创建了CAT-Bench基准和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理复杂时间变化时存在困难，特别是在生成具有渐变属性过渡的视频时，常见的提示插值方法往往无法处理渐变属性过渡，导致不一致性更加明显。

Method: 通过在去噪过程中引入逐帧引导，为每个噪声潜在空间构建数据特定的过渡方向，逐帧指导从初始属性到最终属性的渐变，同时保留视频的运动动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在现有基准上表现优越，实现了视觉保真度、与文本提示的对齐以及无缝的属性过渡。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，能够显著改善视频生成中的属性过渡质量，同时发布了代码和CAT-Bench基准供社区使用。

Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly
when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common
prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle
gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more
pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend
existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through
introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach
constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,
guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while
preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the
Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both
attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of
different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and
smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual
fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless
attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:

Motivation: 传统神经网络方法处理整个超声视频，但无法保证分类基于与CA相关的临床特征。需要一种方法能够确保分类与已知的临床相关特征（如心肌应变）相关联。

Method: 提出解剖约束的Transformer模型，将心肌区域嵌入为变形点和相应图像块作为输入标记。同时将这种约束应用于自监督学习的掩码自编码器预训练，仅掩码和重建解剖区域。

Result: 通过将Transformer和预训练任务约束在CA影像特征集中的心肌区域，在CA分类任务上相比全视频Transformer模型获得了更高的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了明确的保证，确保分类仅关注超声的解剖区域，并能够可视化Transformer在变形心肌上的注意力分数，为临床解释提供了更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities
in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global
longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA
is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional
neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no
assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to
be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to
apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the
classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration
from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the
anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,
which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image
patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be
applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder
pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.
We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the
myocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased
performance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.
Our model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on
only anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer
attention scores over the deforming myocardium.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的方法，用于选择最优的心电图视频剪辑子集，以提高疾病分类性能，同时减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么使用单一剪辑忽略互补信息，要么使用所有剪辑计算成本过高。需要一种智能选择剪辑子集的方法来平衡性能与效率。

Method: 使用强化学习训练智能体，学习何时继续处理特定视图剪辑以减少分类不确定性，或何时停止处理当分类置信度足够高。同时提出可学习的基于注意力的聚合方法来融合多剪辑信息。

Result: 在检测心脏淀粉样变性的任务中，仅使用30%的剪辑就获得了0.91的AUC，超过了使用所有剪辑和其他基准方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著减少计算负担的同时，提高了疾病分类的准确性和效率，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the
acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart,
resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for
instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from
all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from
other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be
prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a
specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method
optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to
either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification
uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is
sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation
method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The
proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac
amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved
from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

Motivation: 随着上下文学习在通用医学图像分割中的应用增加，对大规模多样化数据集的需求激增，加剧了数据稀缺问题。现有数据合成方法难以同时实现高数据多样性和适合医学数据的领域分布。

Method: 基于领域随机化构建数据合成框架，利用真实世界数据集的解剖先验确保真实性，生成多样化解剖结构覆盖广泛数据分布，并显式建模主体间变异以创建适合ICL的数据队列。

Abstract: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image
segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse
datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity.
While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail
to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution
suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a
novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL
ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets,
generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and
explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for
ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's
effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance
gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization
to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for
ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the
generated dataset are publicly available at

Motivation: 准确高效的密集度量深度估计对于机器人和XR中的3D视觉感知至关重要。现有方法通常全局拟合不变仿射模型，而本文旨在利用多视图信息迭代优化像素级尺度。

Method: VIMD框架高度模块化，与多种现有深度估计骨干网络兼容。核心创新是利用多视图信息迭代细化每个像素的尺度，而非全局拟合仿射模型。

Result: 在TartanAir和VOID数据集上的广泛评估显示，VIMD即使在每张图像仅有10-20个稀疏度量深度点的情况下也能实现卓越的准确性和鲁棒性，并在AR Table数据集上展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: VIMD为资源受限环境提供了实用解决方案，其鲁棒性能和强泛化能力在广泛场景中具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual
perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular
visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular
visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit
multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of
globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD
framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing
depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir
and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on
the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide
range of scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效利用临床文本报告作为语义指导来增强视觉特征表示，并消除语义无关信息，导致医学图像分割性能不理想。主要挑战包括病变形态复杂变化以及视觉-语言模态之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: FMISeg是一种后期融合模型，在解码器中建立语言特征与频域视觉特征的交互。包含两个核心模块：频域特征双向交互模块用于增强视觉表示，语言引导频域特征交互模块用于在语言信息指导下抑制语义无关的视觉特征。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估上都优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FMISeg通过频域多模态交互机制，有效解决了医学图像分割中视觉-语言模态融合的挑战，为语言引导的医学图像分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential
for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by
incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex
morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between
vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing
the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant
information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To
address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction
model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late
fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and
frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the
visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature
Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain
features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction
(LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically
irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information.
Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: PolGS通过偏振约束显著提升了3D高斯溅射在复杂反射表面重建中的性能，为实时虚拟现实应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance
properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging
their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind
that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering
surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we
propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective
surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints
into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse
components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective
materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset
validate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型会盲目执行所有用户指令，即使指令不可行或矛盾，导致输出无意义。需要一种能验证指令与图像上下文一致性的方法。

Method: CAMILA（上下文感知掩码图像编辑与语言对齐）通过验证指令与图像的上下文一致性，仅对相关区域应用有效编辑，忽略不可执行指令。

Result: 在包含不可行请求的单指令和多指令图像编辑数据集上评估，CAMILA在性能和语义对齐方面优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CAMILA能有效处理复杂指令挑战，在保持图像完整性的同时实现更好的编辑效果。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize
images through natural language instructions, offering considerable
flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to
follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently
infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address
these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as
CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment).
CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions
and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated
regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive
evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and
multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible
requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment
than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling
complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VFPTrack的高效视觉傅里叶提示跟踪方法，通过快速傅里叶变换学习模态相关提示，解决了现有RGB-T跟踪方法仅依赖空间域信息而忽略频域信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于参数高效微调的RGB-T跟踪方法通常仅使用空间域信息作为提示进行特征提取，忽略了频域信息在提示学习中的关键作用，导致无法达到最佳性能。

Method: VFPTrack方法包含对称特征提取编码器、视觉傅里叶提示和模态融合提示生成器。首先使用冻结的特征提取编码器提取RGB和热红外模态特征，然后将空间域视觉提示与FFT获得的频域提示相结合，最后通过模态融合提示生成模块生成融合模态提示，实现跨模态特征交互。

Result: 在三个流行的RGB-T跟踪基准测试上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法表现出优异的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合空间域和频域信息，并采用创新的模态融合提示生成机制，VFPTrack方法能够更全面地提取和理解模态特征，在RGB-T跟踪任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking
as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based
RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as
prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal
performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in
prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier
Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature
extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality
Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts
through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature
extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.
Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency
domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and
understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,
unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we
use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality
prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to
fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our
method demonstrates outstanding performance.

Motivation: 现有解耦数据集蒸馏方法存在后评估协议不一致的问题，阻碍了该领域的发展。需要系统研究评估设置的影响并建立公平比较基准。

Method: 提出Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD³)方法，系统分析不同后评估设置（如数据增强和软标签）对测试准确率的影响，识别影响性能的关键因素。

Result: 分析表明现有方法性能差异主要源于评估不一致而非方法本质改进，识别出能提升蒸馏数据集有效性的通用策略。

Conclusion: RD³建立了标准化基准和严谨评估协议，为未来数据集蒸馏研究提供了公平可复现的比较基础。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable
models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on
full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational
costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising
results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high
computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training
from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random
data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase
to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled
distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which
hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled
Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different
post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the
reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true
methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.
Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed
to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of
the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve
the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a
standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a
foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation
research.

Result: 在多个临床分割基准上，仅使用5%-20%标注数据即可达到或超过全监督模型性能

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一种可扩展的端到端学习策略，在不牺牲准确性的前提下显著降低医学图像分割的标注需求

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical
image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially
reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active
learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by
selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional
SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining
cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational
overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we
present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation
framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering
(FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net
training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding
high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need
for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided
learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical
segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable
to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data.
This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing
annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Result: 在MEAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多个指标上优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: 显式的AU到关键点建模对于表达性说话头生成是有效的，运动与外观的分离提高了表情准确性、时间稳定性和视觉真实感

Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation
with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike
prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model
explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,
per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion
generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU
intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates
realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference
image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,
temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for
expressive talking head generation.

TL;DR: ExpFace是一种新的指数角度边界损失函数，通过在角度空间中应用指数项作为边界，对中心区域的干净样本施加更大惩罚，对边缘区域的噪声样本施加较小惩罚，从而提升人脸识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于边界的softmax损失函数（如SphereFace、CosFace、ArcFace）虽然增强了类内紧凑性和类间可分性，但忽视了噪声样本的影响。研究发现干净样本主要聚集在角度空间中心区域，而噪声样本倾向于分布在边缘区域。

Method: 提出指数角度边界损失（ExpFace），在角度空间中引入指数项作为边界，在中心区域施加较大惩罚，在边缘区域施加较小惩罚，强调干净样本同时抑制噪声样本。

Result: 实验表明ExpFace实现了最先进的性能，避免了SphereFace的训练不稳定性和ArcFace的非单调性问题，其相似度曲线与角度空间中的决策边界惩罚方式一致。

Conclusion: ExpFace通过创新的指数边界设计有效处理了噪声样本问题，在人脸识别任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新的思路和开源代码。

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

Conclusion: Logics-Parsing模型通过强化学习增强的LVLM方法，显著提升了复杂文档解析能力，并建立了全面的评估基准

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred
significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional
pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in
converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula
recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for
document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling
complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address
this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end
LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates
meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and
reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by
incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten
Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous
evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of
1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty
sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and
State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究发现Dice相似系数(DSC)等重叠度指标本身存在性别偏见，因为较小的器官在相同大小分割错误下会获得更低的DSC分数，导致女性由于器官体积较小而受到不公平的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注模型或数据集的性别差异，但尚未有研究探讨DSC指标本身可能引入的性别偏见问题。

Method: 在50名参与者的MRI手动标注上应用相同大小的合成错误，确保性别间的可比性，量化DSC和标准化DSC的性别差异。

Result: 即使是最小的错误（如1mm边界偏移）也会产生系统性的性别间DSC差异。小结构平均DSC差异约0.03，中等结构约0.01，只有大结构（如肺和肝）基本不受影响。

Conclusion: 使用DSC作为评估指标的公平性研究不应期望男女获得相同分数，因为指标本身存在偏见。认识到这一因素对于医学图像分析的准确公平评估至关重要。

Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize
segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs
by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in
lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.
While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,
no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.
This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC
in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied
equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants
to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary
shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,
average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around
0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,
with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that
fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect
identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A
segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error
magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work
raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences
in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from
the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and
fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种轻量级Vision Transformer架构，专门用于在边缘设备上实现高质量的高动态范围（HDR）成像，解决了现有方法计算成本高和重影伪影的双重瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高质量HDR成像是一个关键挑战，现有多曝光融合方法存在高计算成本和重影伪影问题，阻碍了其广泛应用。

Method: 基于Context-Aware Vision Transformer，将输入图像转换为YCbCr色彩空间，使用Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion模块抑制重影，并引入Inverted Residual Embedding、Dynamic Tanh和Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution等技术实现轻量化设计。

Result: 与基线相比，主要版本减少了约67%的FLOPS，在CPU上推理速度提升超过5倍，在边缘设备上提升2.5倍，同时保持优异的图像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘设备提供了高效且无重影的HDR成像解决方案，在各种动态场景中展现出多功能性和实用性。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on
resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,
as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent
surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a
mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally
face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,
hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a
light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR
reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the
Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the
YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then
employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress
ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce
Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced
Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at
multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main
version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in
computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between
performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared
to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and
increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge
device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and
ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and
practicality across various dynamic scenarios.

*Yixun Zhang,Feng Zhou,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiTAA是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的双任务对抗攻击方法，能够同时降低目标检测性能并偏置单目深度估计，揭示了自动驾驶多任务感知中的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D/3D攻击方法存在任务孤立、缺乏可控深度偏置机制、缺少标准化跨任务传输评估协议等问题，导致检测与深度任务间的交互关系未被充分探索。

Method: 采用3D高斯泼溅构建双模型攻击框架，支持全图像和补丁设置，兼容常见检测器和深度估计器；设计复合损失函数，将检测抑制与可控对数深度偏置耦合，实现稳定的跨任务优化。

Result: 实验显示BiTAA能产生一致的跨任务性能退化，并揭示了从检测到深度和从深度到检测传输之间存在明显的不对称性。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了多任务相机感知的实际风险，并呼吁在自动驾驶场景中开发跨任务感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains
vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and
monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task
silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no
standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction
between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task
adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single
perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing
monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that
supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common
detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation
(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that
couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth
bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far
misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also
propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and
real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear
asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results
highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate
cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.

*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrCGAN是一种用于增强低分辨率天体摄影图像的生成模型，通过3D卷积层、多光谱融合和天体物理正则化模块来重建高保真度的天体图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小望远镜观测图像分辨率低、质量差的问题，传统CycleGAN模型仅限于2D映射且会扭曲恒星和星系的形态。

Method: 扩展CycleGAN框架，引入3D卷积层捕捉体积空间相关性，多光谱融合对齐光学和近红外域，天体物理正则化模块保持恒星形态。

Result: StrCGAN生成的图像不仅视觉上更清晰，而且物理上更一致，在天体物理图像增强任务中优于标准GAN模型。

Conclusion: StrCGAN通过创新的3D卷积、多光谱融合和物理约束，成功实现了高质量的天体图像重建，为低分辨率天体观测提供了有效的增强解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to
enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct
high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task
that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of
small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional
models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but
are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and
galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with
three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial
correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)
domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar
morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning
optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain
consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to
generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically
consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical
image enhancement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为meta-weight-ensembler的自适应模型集成方法，通过元学习训练混合系数生成器来解决持续学习中的任务级和层级知识冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型集成方法在持续学习中通常面临任务级和层级的知识冲突问题，导致新旧任务的学习性能都受到影响。

Method: 使用元学习训练混合系数生成器，为每个层单独生成适当的混合系数，自适应地融合不同任务的知识。该方法可以与现有持续学习方法灵活结合。

Result: 在多个持续学习数据集上的实验表明，meta-weight-ensembler有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，并达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习自适应积累不同任务知识的先验知识，实现了新旧任务的高效学习。

Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which
alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving
knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble
methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer
levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To
solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses
knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a
mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate
mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge
conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to
address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior
knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused
model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks.
Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning
methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that
meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的逼真度不断提高引发了错误信息和隐私泄露的严重担忧，现有方法大多依赖二元分类缺乏解释性，或过度依赖监督微调导致泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出ThinkFake框架，使用配备伪造推理提示的多模态大语言模型，通过Group Relative Policy Optimization强化学习训练，设计结构化检测流程来提升推理质量。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns
about misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for
accurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have
made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or
depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization.
In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable
framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is
trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning
with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to
perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs.
We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning
quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results
validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

Motivation: 当前具身AI在现实人类中心场景（如家庭环境）中部署仍面临挑战，主要困难在于难以建模个体人类偏好和行为。

Method: 构建包含2000+高质量场景的基准测试，覆盖30+个HM3D数据集中的真实家庭环境，每个场景包含自然语言描述和物品与所有者的明确关联。支持两种评估模式：未知环境中的主动导航和已映射场景中的物品定位。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了需要能够感知、推理和记忆个性化信息的具身智能体，为现实世界辅助机器人铺平道路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards
real-world assistive robot.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型的对抗性攻击框架FreezeVLA，能够通过对抗图像使模型"冻结"并忽略后续指令，揭示了VLA模型的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人领域发展迅速，但其对抗攻击的安全性和鲁棒性研究不足。研究发现对抗图像可以使VLA模型"冻结"，导致机器人在关键干预时无法行动，存在严重安全隐患。

Method: 提出FreezeVLA攻击框架，通过min-max双层优化生成和评估动作冻结攻击。在三个最先进的VLA模型和四个机器人基准上进行实验验证。

Result: FreezeVLA平均攻击成功率达到76.2%，显著优于现有方法。生成的对抗图像具有强迁移性，单个图像即可在不同语言提示下可靠诱导瘫痪。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLA模型的关键安全风险，强调了开发鲁棒防御机制的紧迫性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by
enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex,
long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial
attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a
critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA
models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat
effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,
potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically
study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that
generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level
optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic
benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,
significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images
generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image
reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings
expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for
robust defense mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法在低光照、严重遮挡等复杂场景下性能下降，缺乏高级语义理解能力

Method: 采用指令微调使MLLM生成结构化场景描述，设计自适应映射机制将语义信息转换为边缘检测器参数调整信号，在边缘云协作框架中基于置信度自动选择调用云端语义指导或直接输出边缘检测结果

Result: 在低光照和高度遮挡场景中，延迟降低79%以上，计算成本降低70%，同时保持准确性

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了复杂场景下的检测准确性和效率，实现了语义增强的边缘云协作目标检测

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门用于360度球形或全向图像的超像素分割方法SphSPS，该方法考虑3D球形采集空间的几何特性，在分割精度和形状规整性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着广角图像采集设备的广泛使用，需要专门的处理方法来应对球形图像的几何特性。现有超像素分割方法主要针对标准2D平面图像设计，无法有效处理360度球形图像的失真问题。

Method: SphSPS方法基于球形最短路径，将像素与超像素中心之间的最短路径概念推广到球形空间，快速提取相关聚类特征。同时将全局规整性度量推广到球形空间。

Result: 在参考的360度球形全景分割数据集和合成道路全向图像上验证，SphSPS在分割精度、噪声鲁棒性和规整性方面显著优于平面和球形的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SphSPS为360度图像的超像素应用提供了一个非常有价值的工具，通过考虑采集空间的几何特性，同时提高了分割精度和超像素形状规整性。

Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and
accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for
dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods
segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called
superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment
standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without
distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called
SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide
360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of
the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path
between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering
features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space
to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation
accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity
aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,
addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.
Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o
spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional
images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to
noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based
applications on 360o images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督和对比学习方法需要大规模模型和大量精心整理的数据，但仍然难以处理批次效应，这限制了细胞表型响应预测模型在药物发现中的应用。

Method: 提出Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN)，通过跨孔对齐相同扰动下细胞的嵌入表示，在掩码孪生架构中强制语义一致性，从而学习对批次效应鲁棒的特征表示。

Result: 在基因-基因关系检索基准测试中，CWA-MSN比最先进的自监督方法(OpenPhenom)和对比学习方法(CellCLIP)分别提升29%和9%的基准分数，同时使用更少的数据(0.2M vs 2.2M图像)和更小的模型(22M vs 1.48B参数)。

Conclusion: CWA-MSN是一种简单有效的细胞图像表示学习方法，即使在有限的数据和参数预算下也能实现高效的表型建模。

Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical
and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing
therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However,
extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting
representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and
contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge
amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We
present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel
representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to
the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency
despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this
alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining
data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship
retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly
available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP)
methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while
training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M
images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN
vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation,
enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter
budgets.

Motivation: 解决复杂场景3D建模中航空和地面图像因视角差异大而难以找到可靠对应点的问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案能够为航空和地面图像提供可靠的特征匹配，在特征匹配和场景渲染方面优于广泛使用的方法。

Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in
3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding
reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature
matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate
intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive
viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are
reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to
their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for
scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For
accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed
by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate
high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and
ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature
matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground
images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences
through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the
validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature
matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used
methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious
increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide
enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based
scene rendering.

Conclusion: GS-RoadPatching提供了一种直接通过3DGS模态进行替代性场景修复的有效方法，摆脱了对2D跨模态时空一致性的依赖

Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene
completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are
represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting
methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based
diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing
regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing
directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring
spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for
time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly
repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities
within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for
structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.
Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch
measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,
subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in
3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective
substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and
the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.
Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available

TL;DR: 提出了一种解释CLIP-ResNet神经元的新技术，通过将神经元对输出贡献分解为个体计算路径来分析神经元-注意力头对，发现这些对可以用嵌入空间中的单一方向近似表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解CLIP-ResNet中神经元的内部工作机制，探索神经网络中可解释的计算单元。

Method: 分析CLIP-ResNet中所有神经元对和后续注意力头的组合，将神经元-注意力头对近似为图像-文本嵌入空间中的单一方向，并通过文本关联进行解释。

Result: 发现只有稀疏的神经元-注意力头对显著贡献输出值，有些多义性对代表相应神经元的子概念。在无训练语义分割任务中超越先前方法，并能有效监测数据集分布偏移。

Conclusion: 通过检查神经网络中的个体计算路径可以揭示可解释单元，这些单元可用于下游任务，为神经网络解释提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的投诉挖掘任务——基于视频的投诉描述（CoD-V），旨在帮助用户通过视频表达产品缺陷投诉，并引入了ComVID数据集和新的投诉保留评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户经常难以通过文字清晰表达投诉，但可以轻松上传显示产品缺陷的视频。现有的可解释投诉挖掘工作未能有效解决用户通过视频表达关切的需求。

Method: 提出了多模态检索增强生成（RAG）嵌入的VideoLLaMA2-7b模型，能够生成考虑用户情感状态的投诉描述。使用ComVID数据集（包含1,175个投诉视频和对应描述）进行训练和评估。

Result: 对多个视频语言模型进行了全面评估，包括预训练和微调版本，使用了METEOR、困惑度和Coleman-Liau可读性分数等多种评估指标。

Conclusion: 本研究为通过视频表达投诉的新研究方向奠定了基础，为构建用户视频投诉平台提供了技术支持。

Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining,
articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant
challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to
express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and
resources are available at: https://github.com/sarmistha-D/CoD-V.

*Phyo Thet Yee,Dimitrios Kollias,Sudeepta Mishra,Abhinav Dhall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynchroRaMa是一个创新的多模态情感嵌入框架，通过结合文本情感分析和音频情感识别，生成具有丰富情感表达力的说话人脸视频，解决了现有方法在情感捕捉和动态变化表示方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感感知方法主要依赖单一模态（音频或图像）进行情感嵌入，难以捕捉细微的情感线索；且大多基于单张参考图像，无法有效表示跨时间的动态动作或属性变化。

Method: 提出SynchroRaMa框架：1）多模态情感嵌入（文本情感分析+音频情感识别+音频价唤醒特征）；2）音频到运动模块确保头部运动和唇部同步；3）引入LLM生成的场景描述作为额外文本输入，增强时间一致性和视觉真实感。

Result: 在基准数据集上的定量和定性实验表明，SynchroRaMa在图像质量、表情保持和运动真实感方面优于现有最优方法。用户研究进一步证实其在整体自然度、运动多样性和视频流畅度方面获得更高主观评分。

Conclusion: SynchroRaMa通过多模态情感嵌入和动态场景描述，显著提升了说话人脸生成的情感表达力和视觉真实感，为自然的人机交互应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,
particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar
interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single
modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability
to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a
single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic
changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we
introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion
embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and
audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal
features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more
authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion
and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)
module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,
SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model
(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and
high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and
textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa
outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,
expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that
SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in
overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness. Our project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniScene框架，通过视觉语言模型和多模态融合实现类人的4D场景理解，在自动驾驶领域超越现有基于深度重建的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统主要依赖基于深度的3D重建，缺乏真正的场景理解能力，而人类视觉能够将2D观察转化为自我中心的3D场景理解。

Method: 提出OmniScene框架：1）OmniVLM视觉语言模型整合多视角和时间感知；2）师生架构和知识蒸馏将文本表示嵌入3D实例特征；3）分层融合策略自适应校准几何和语义特征的重要性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上全面评估，与10多个SOTA模型对比，在感知、预测、规划和视觉问答等任务上均取得最优结果。

Conclusion: OmniScene建立了新的性能基准，实现了更类人的感知-理解-行动架构，为自动驾驶系统提供了真正的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注透视投影视频生成中的相机控制，而几何一致的全景视频生成仍然具有挑战性，主要由于全景姿态表示和球面投影的固有复杂性

Method: 提出全景Plücker嵌入通过球坐标变换编码相机外参，开发球面极线模块通过沿极线的自适应注意力掩码强制执行几何约束，实现跨视图特征聚合

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法能生成与相机轨迹一致的高质量全景视频，在全景视频生成方面远超现有方法

Conclusion: CamPVG框架成功解决了全景视频生成中的几何一致性问题，为精确相机控制的全景视频生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,
offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods
predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video
generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains
challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in
panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,
we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video
generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding
for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical
projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that
encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate
transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to
equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar
module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking
along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature
aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated
panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far
surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

Conclusion: SDE-DET为沙田柚检测提供了可靠方法，为自动收获机器人的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation
for the further development of automatic harvest robots.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为代理目标攻击（PTA）的新方法，旨在解决多模态预训练模型中现有目标对抗攻击在泛化性和不可检测性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态预训练模型（如ImageBind）在跨模态对齐任务中面临目标对抗攻击的泛化性不足和容易被检测的问题，这引发了严重的安全担忧。

Method: PTA方法利用多个源模态和目标模态代理来优化目标对抗样本，确保其在逃避防御的同时与多个潜在目标对齐，并提供理论分析来平衡泛化性和不可检测性。

Result: 实验结果表明，PTA在各种相关目标上实现了高成功率，并且对多种异常检测方法保持不可检测。

Conclusion: PTA方法有效解决了多模态预训练模型中目标对抗攻击的泛化性和不可检测性问题，为模型安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data
modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across
downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security
concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained
models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and
undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)
exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar
targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can
be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited
undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method
called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and
target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to
defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide
theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and
undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the
specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results
demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related
targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用DINOv2预训练模型的嵌入特征，结合Dirichlet Process Mixture模型进行医学图像异常检测，避免了传统内存库方法在大数据集上的计算负担问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于内存库的异常检测方法在小数据集上有效，但在大规模医学数据集上计算负担过重。需要一种更高效的方法来建模正常特征的分布。

Method: 使用DINOv2预训练模型的嵌入特征，通过Dirichlet Process Mixture模型自动调整混合组件数量来建模正常特征分布，利用组件中心与嵌入特征的相似度作为异常分数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在医学图像异常检测基准上表现具有竞争力，推理时间至少减少一半，且归一化的DINOv2嵌入特征与解剖结构更对齐。

Conclusion: 基于DINOv2嵌入和DPMM的方法为大规模医学图像异常检测提供了高效且有效的解决方案，即使模型在自然图像上训练也能很好地迁移到医学领域。

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is

Motivation: 机器学习中高效数据标注是一个关键挑战，特别是对象检测任务需要大量标注数据。主动学习通过选择最具信息量的样本来最小化标注成本。

Method: 提出结合不确定性和多样性策略的主动学习方法，在表格检测任务中使用CascadeTabNet和YOLOv9架构，在TableBank-LaTeX和TableBank-Word数据集上进行评估。

Result: 主动学习方法显著优于随机采样，在相同标注预算下获得更高的mAP分数，同时保持与全监督模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了标注工作量，在有限预算下实现了高效的表格检测模型训练。

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

Motivation: 现有的图像篡改定位方法采用一次性预测范式，忽略了篡改过程的序列性和层次性特征，导致维度坍塌和任务本质不匹配。

Method: 提出RITA框架，将篡改定位建模为条件序列预测任务，逐层预测篡改区域，每一步的预测作为下一步的条件。构建HSIM基准数据集和HSS评估指标。

Result: 在传统基准测试上达到最先进水平，为新的层次化定位任务奠定基础，验证了其作为通用有效范式的潜力。

Conclusion: RITA框架通过建模篡改过程的序列特性，解决了现有方法的局限性，为图像篡改定位提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a
series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting
sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods
remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in
a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.
This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into
a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a
fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation
localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA
framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered
manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby
explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among
editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data
and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess
sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA
achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the
novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and
effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

Result: 在TCGA六个数据集上的评估显示，PS3模型优于临床、单模态和多模态基线方法。

Conclusion: 病理报告作为补充信息能显著提升生存预测性能，原型方法有效解决了多模态异质性问题。

Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily
focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with
genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We
hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic
performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,
offer readily available complementary information by summarizing
histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical
context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their
heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several
billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of
varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we
propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which
are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival
prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).
Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,
leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and
standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly
represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway
prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular
functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting
prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against
clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效抵御攻击，同时保持有意义的实用性

Conclusion: 基于GAN的视觉隐私转换方法在保护隐私的同时实现了有效的生物认证

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

Method: 提出轻量级模型预测视频帧质量分数，判断是否适合资源密集的验证模型；使用FNMR和ISRR指标在32,000+图像数据集上验证；通过冻结ImageNet预训练网络进行跨域分析。

Result: 在105款智能手机的大规模数据集上验证有效；发现冻结的通用骨干网络比完全微调模型对未见打印技术有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 对于物理制造引起的域偏移，冻结的通用骨干网络比完全微调更鲁棒，后者容易过拟合源域伪影，这为实际应用中的泛化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验显示性能持续提升，腹部CT数据集的Dice分数从60.58%显著提高到65.58%，同时增强了模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 首次将专家混合机制引入可变形图像配准任务，SHMoAReg在性能和可解释性方面均有显著提升，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based
Deformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale
features and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial
locations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features
(that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and
homogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel
expert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in
both encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture
of Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous
Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the
specialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal
combination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE
predicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel
using experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,
with a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal
CT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by
differentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into
DIR tasks. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像去雾中表现出色，但重新训练和推理时的大量采样步骤带来了巨大的计算负担，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 探索雾霾图像在预训练扩散模型语义潜在空间中的特性，将不同时间步的扩散潜在表示集成到精心设计的去雾网络中，为图像去雾提供指导。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在图像去雾方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffLI²D通过有效利用预训练扩散模型的信息表示，为将扩散模型引入图像去雾提供了新的视角，同时避免了重新训练和迭代采样。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative
solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the
data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the
retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps
during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in
image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy
images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and
propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed
DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of
pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics
of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight,
we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into
a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image
dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative
sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations
derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel
perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior performance to existing image dehazing methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的高光谱适配器，利用预训练的视觉基础模型来有效学习高光谱数据，在自动驾驶数据集上实现了最先进的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的高光谱语义分割方法表现不佳，因为它们依赖为RGB输入优化的架构和学习框架。高光谱成像具有丰富的空间光谱信息，可以在复杂材料组成、变化光照等挑战性环境中实现鲁棒的机器人感知。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的高光谱适配器架构，包含光谱变换器和光谱感知空间先验模块来提取丰富的空间光谱特征。还引入了模态感知交互块，通过专门的提取和注入机制有效整合高光谱表示和冻结的视觉Transformer特征。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将预训练视觉基础模型应用于高光谱数据，为复杂环境下的机器人感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 为了解决科学视觉问答中图像和文本分离输入的问题，本文提出将视觉和文本内容嵌入到单一图像中的新范式，并通过合成数据集和微调方法显著提升了多语言多模态模型在13种语言上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学视觉问答对视觉语言模型提出了重大挑战，因为科学图的复杂性和多模态上下文。传统方法将图和伴随文本（如问题和答案选项）作为分开的输入处理，而EXAMS-V引入的新范式将两者嵌入到单一图像中，但即使在零样本设置下，最先进的专有模型也表现不佳，凸显了任务特定微调的需求。

Method: 为了解决"文本在图像中"格式训练数据的稀缺性，我们通过将现有的分开的图像-文本对转换为统一图像来合成一个新的数据集。在一个小型多语言多模态模型上，对我们的合成数据和EXAMS-V的混合进行微调。

Result: 在13种语言上取得了显著的增益，展示了强大的平均改进和跨语言迁移能力。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据集和微调方法，成功解决了科学视觉问答中图像和文本分离输入的问题，显著提升了多语言多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for
vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their
multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying
text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V
introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a
single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly
on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific
fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image"
format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text
pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on
a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13
languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual
transfer.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了EchoBench基准，用于系统评估医学大型视觉语言模型中的谄媚行为（sycophancy），发现所有模型都存在显著的谄媚倾向，即使准确性适中的医学专用模型谄媚率也超过95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学LVLM基准过于关注排行榜准确性，忽视了可靠性和安全性。研究旨在评估模型在高风险临床环境中对用户提供信息的不加批判附和倾向。

Method: 构建包含2,122张图像、18个科室、20种模态的EchoBench基准，使用90个模拟患者、医学生和医生偏见的提示来评估模型。评估了医学专用、开源和专有LVLM。

Result: 所有模型都表现出显著的谄媚行为：最佳专有模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet谄媚率为45.98%，GPT-4.1达到59.15%。医学专用模型谄媚率超过95%但准确性一般。通过偏见类型、科室等细粒度分析识别了易感因素。

Conclusion: 研究发现更高质量/多样性的数据和更强的领域知识可以减少谄媚行为而不损害无偏见准确性。简单的提示级干预措施能有效降低谄媚率，强调了超越准确性的稳健评估需求。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize
leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy
-- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in
high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to
systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images
across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased
inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate
medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial
sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%
sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%
sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,
department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase
susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger
domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench
also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions
(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and
motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the
need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance
toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖的AI系统需要透明性和安全性，但后验解释的质量和可靠性常因不一致性和缺乏忠实度而受到质疑。

Method: 通过大量实证评估，比较自然训练、对抗训练和剪枝三种训练方法对后验解释（使用显著性图）质量的影响。

Result: 剪枝显著增强了解释的可理解性和忠实度，不仅提高了模型效率，还强制学习表示的稀疏性，导致更可解释和可靠的决策。

Conclusion: 剪枝是开发透明深度学习模型的有前景策略，特别适用于资源受限的车载AI系统。

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems,
where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety.
Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models
but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due
to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.
This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training
approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect
the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through
extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly
enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency
maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but
also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable
and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a
promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially
in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.

Conclusion: C²MIL通过双因果建模有效解决了图基MIL中的语义和拓扑偏差问题，显著提升了生存分析模型的性能。

Abstract: Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival
analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs)
due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in
staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs
that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting
in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the
interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we
introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and
propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL.
C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module
for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal
subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization
strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables
simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities.
Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and
interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement
for diverse MIL baselines. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT图像中牙齿和牙髓的手动分割需要专业知识和大量时间，亟需能够有效利用未标记数据的自动化算法

Method: 基于U-Mamba2模型构建半监督学习框架，采用多阶段训练：自监督预训练、一致性正则化（引入输入和特征扰动）、伪标签策略（降低损失权重）

Result: 在验证集上获得平均得分0.872和DSC 0.969，表现出优越性能

Conclusion: U-Mamba2-SSL框架在牙齿和牙髓分割任务中表现出色，为临床治疗规划和诊断提供了有效的自动化解决方案

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and
diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is
exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated
algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we
propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on
the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL
achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation
dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. The code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了"光学海洋配方"框架，用于在受控水下环境中创建真实数据集，解决水下机器视觉评估缺乏可控测试环境的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器视觉开发面临挑战，主要因为缺乏能够模拟真实光学问题的可控测试环境，如颜色失真、散射效应等，且现有评估方法缺乏通用性。

Method: 通过使用校准的颜色和散射添加剂，创建可重复的受控水下条件，生成真实数据集，支持多种视觉任务的基准测试。

Result: 开发了一个演示数据集，并展示了该系统在水下视觉任务中的应用，数据集和评估代码将公开提供。

Conclusion: 光学海洋配方为水下机器视觉提供了独特的测试框架，能够在真实但受控的条件下进行分析和评估。

Abstract: The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments
remains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to
specific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled,
ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,
such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced
contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light
patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance
of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and
seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific
optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack
generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is
technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical
Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled
underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,
using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and
controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.
Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in
realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment
enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,
including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual
SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset
generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of
our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code
will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对自动驾驶视觉语言模型（VLM-AD）的通用伪装攻击框架UCA，通过特征空间优化生成物理可实现的伪装纹理，在多种模型和场景下显著超越现有攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法存在局限性：物理对抗攻击主要针对视觉模块难以直接迁移到VLM-AD系统，而针对VLM-AD的攻击主要集中在数字层面。需要开发能够在物理世界中有效攻击VLM-AD系统的方法。

Method: UCA框架在特征空间操作，引入特征分歧损失（FDL）最大化干净图像和对抗图像的表征差异，采用多尺度学习策略和调整采样比例来增强对现实场景中尺度和视角变化的适应性。

Result: 实验表明UCA能在各种VLM-AD模型和驾驶场景中诱导错误驾驶命令，显著超越现有最先进攻击方法（3-P指标提升30%），并在不同视角和动态条件下表现出强大的攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UCA是首个针对VLM-AD的物理可实现对抗攻击框架，具有高实用部署潜力，为自动驾驶系统的安全性评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising
research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning
capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains
vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve
misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing
attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily
target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD
systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)
Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital
level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage
Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on
optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate
physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization
across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the
observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA
introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational
discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates
a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its
adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world
scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various
VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing
state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,
UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic
conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

Motivation: 解决现有点云上采样方法在几何可解释性和输入稀疏性鲁棒性方面的不足，3D传感器产生的点云通常稀疏且嘈杂，需要稠密高保真3D表示

Method: 使用各向异性3D高斯分布建模每个点的局部邻域几何结构，在局部几何域进行显式点采样生成稠密但粗糙的点云，然后通过细化网络调整分布均匀性和边缘清晰度

Conclusion: PU-Gaussian通过局部高斯建模和显式几何采样，在保持几何可解释性的同时实现了鲁棒的点云上采样，代码和模型权重已公开

Abstract: Point clouds produced by 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, posing
challenges for tasks requiring dense and high-fidelity 3D representations.
Prior work has explored both implicit feature-based upsampling and
distance-function learning to address this, but often at the expense of
geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the
local neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian
distributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure,
allowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by
direct point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse,
point cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to
produce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges. We perform extensive
testing on the PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating that PU-Gaussian achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We make code and model weights publicly available
at https://github.com/mvg-inatech/PU-Gaussian.git.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了CNN具有纹理偏见的假设，提出了一个领域无关的框架来量化特征依赖，发现CNN主要依赖局部形状特征而非纹理，且这种依赖可以通过现代训练策略缓解。不同领域的模型表现出不同的特征依赖模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新检验Geirhos等人关于CNN具有纹理偏见的假设，指出其冲突实验的局限性，需要更系统的方法来量化特征依赖。

Method: 提出了一个领域无关的框架，通过系统性地抑制形状、纹理和颜色线索来量化特征依赖，避免强制选择冲突的混淆因素。在受控抑制条件下评估人类和神经网络。

Result: 发现CNN并非天生纹理偏见，而是主要依赖局部形状特征。现代训练策略或架构（ConvNeXt、ViTs）可以显著缓解这种依赖。不同领域模型的特征依赖模式不同：计算机视觉模型优先形状，医学影像模型强调颜色，遥感模型更依赖纹理。

Conclusion: CNN的特征依赖模式比先前认为的更复杂，受训练策略和领域特性的显著影响，挑战了CNN天生纹理偏见的简单假设。

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently
texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep
learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the
cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we
propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through
systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the
confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks
under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently
texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,
this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies
or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across
computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance
patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,
medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a
stronger reliance towards texture. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中CT图像通常具有较大的层厚，导致层间分辨率远低于面内分辨率，这种不一致的分辨率可能给疾病诊断带来困难。现有方法未能充分利用3D CT体积的各向异性特性。

Method: 设计了一个独特的框架，将高分辨率面内纹理细节作为参考，并将其迁移到低分辨率层间图像中。引入了多参考非局部注意力模块，从多个面内图像中提取有意义的特征来重建层间高频细节。

Result: 在公共CT数据集（包括真实配对基准）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在CT切片插值方面显著优于现有竞争方法。

Conclusion: 验证了所提出框架的有效性，该方法能够有效改善CT图像的层间分辨率，为医学诊断提供更高质量的图像数据。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging
modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually
acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage
and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower
inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent
resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based
volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice
resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the
through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,
the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT
slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.
Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane
texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution
through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local
attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing
through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly
better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT
datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. The source code of this work is available at

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在外观和几何重建、时间生成和新视角合成任务上达到最先进性能，同时在下游评估中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: PhiGenesis成功解决了动态4D场景生成中的关键挑战，为同时支持时间外推和空间新视角合成提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes
that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view
synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel
view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified
framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with
geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera
parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting
representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis
leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable
feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture
supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including
geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a
geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as
priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address
geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel
conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising.
This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative
influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view
synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance
in downstream evaluations. Homepage is at

Motivation: 解决现有乳腺X光片基础模型在训练数据多样性不足、模型泛化能力有限以及缺乏全面临床评估等方面的根本局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段预训练策略：首先通过自监督学习训练教师模型提取可迁移特征，然后结合监督学习和知识蒸馏将特征和临床知识转移到VersaMammo中。使用包含706,239张图像的最大多机构数据集。

Result: 在92个特定任务（68个内部任务和24个外部验证任务）中，VersaMammo在50个内部任务和20个外部任务中排名第一，平均排名分别为1.5和1.2。

Conclusion: VersaMammo展示了卓越的泛化能力和临床实用性，为实现可靠和可扩展的乳腺癌筛查和诊断提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the
early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in
foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation
remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient
diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of
comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce
VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome
these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset
to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,
we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram
foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised
learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,
supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both
features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive
evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including
68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical
task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image
retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out
of 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2,
respectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and
clinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and
scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

TL;DR: HiPerformer是一种创新的医学图像分割方法，采用模块化分层架构和局部-全局特征融合模块，解决了传统CNN-Transformer混合架构中特征不一致和信息损失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN-Transformer混合架构的方法采用简单的特征融合技术（如串行堆叠、端点连接或点加），难以解决特征间的不一致性，容易导致信息冲突和丢失。

Method: 1）编码器采用模块化分层架构，动态并行融合多源特征；2）设计局部-全局特征融合（LGFF）模块实现局部细节和全局语义信息的精确集成；3）提出渐进金字塔聚合（PPA）模块替代传统跳跃连接以增强多尺度特征表示能力。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有分割技术，具有更高的分割精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HiPerformer通过创新的架构设计和特征融合机制，有效解决了医学图像分割中局部细节与全局上下文融合的挑战，实现了更全面的特征表示。

Abstract: Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image
segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high
accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid
architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial
stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to
address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information
conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively
propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular
hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in
parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.
The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling
capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient
information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of
features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.
Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve
precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic
information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and
resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance
multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise
interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to
replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation
techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code
is available at https://github.com/xzphappy/HiPerformer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于人类感知的人脸相似度度量方法，通过创建包含6400个三元组注释的数据集和度量学习来预测人脸相似度，解决了现有模型只能进行二元身份分类的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社会对隐私问题的关注增加，人脸匿名化技术不断发展，包括人脸替换方法。在保持匿名性和自然性之间需要平衡：过于相似的人脸会损害匿名性，而差异过大的人脸会降低自然性。现有模型只能进行二元身份分类，难以衡量细微的相似度差异。

Method: 创建包含6400个三元组注释的数据集，采用度量学习方法预测人脸相似度，基于人类感知来评估人脸相似性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在人脸相似度预测和基于属性的人脸分类任务上都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于人类感知的人脸相似度度量方法有效解决了现有二元分类模型的局限性，为人脸匿名化技术提供了更精细的相似度评估工具。

Abstract: In response to rising societal awareness of privacy concerns, face
anonymization techniques have advanced, including the emergence of
face-swapping methods that replace one identity with another. Achieving a
balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping requires careful
selection of identities: overly similar faces compromise anonymity, while
dissimilar ones reduce naturalness. Existing models, however, focus on binary
identity classification "the same person or not", making it difficult to
measure nuanced similarities such as "completely different" versus "highly
similar but different." This paper proposes a human-perception-based face
similarity metric, creating a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and metric
learning to predict the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based
face classification tasks over existing methods.

Conclusion: FAST框架能够高效生成高质量的工业异常分割数据，解决了现有方法在采样效率和生成质量之间的平衡问题，为工业异常检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations,
yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label.
Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a
promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling
efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial
regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between
anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of
controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In
this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring
two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the
Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling
algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly
synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine
aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented
anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the
anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,
preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.
Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST
consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream
segmentation tasks. We release the code at:

Conclusion: 研究提供了实用的鹿检测数据集和模型评估，证明了在边缘设备上部署高效鹿检测系统的可行性，为农业智能防护系统开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,
estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,
highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these
methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming
systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous
solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress
in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the
lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field
deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models
for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of
this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available
dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,
derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive
comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO
architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a
high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing
platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the
real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific
model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with
GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals
that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and
YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and
computational efficiency (FPS > 30). To support further research, both the
source code and datasets are publicly available at

Motivation: 随着在线购物的发展，虚拟试穿技术需求激增，但实现有效的姿态控制面临挑战，包括选择最佳姿态表示、无额外参数整合姿态、平衡姿态保持与灵活控制。

Method: 基于纯拼接范式的基线VTON模型，通过空间拼接姿态数据（比较姿态图和骨架），采用混合掩码训练策略（细粒度掩码和边界框掩码），无需外部编码器或控制网络。

Result: 实验表明，使用姿态图进行姿态拼接效果最佳，显著提升了姿态保持和输出真实感，混合掩码训练策略支持不同姿态和条件下的灵活产品整合。

Conclusion: 通过简单的空间拼接姿态图和混合掩码训练，可以在不增加模型复杂度的情况下有效实现VTON中的姿态控制，为虚拟试穿技术提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON)
technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves
by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet
challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures
accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse
orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose
conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting
the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional
parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.
  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the
reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex
attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this
pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing
performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional
parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose
stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose
preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask
training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model
to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

Abstract: Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos
from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D
controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel
framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical
parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that
learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,
sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics
parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point
trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations
generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel
spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and
incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical
plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,
physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video
models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing
methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility. Project Page:

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is increasingly pervasive across domains, with ever
more complex models delivering impressive predictive performance. This fast
technological advancement however comes at a concerning environmental cost,
with state-of-the-art models - particularly deep neural networks and large
language models - requiring substantial computational resources and energy. In
this work, we present the intuition of Green AI dynamic model selection, an
approach based on dynamic model selection that aims at reducing the
environmental footprint of AI by selecting the most sustainable model while
minimizing potential accuracy loss. Specifically, our approach takes into
account the inference task, the environmental sustainability of available
models, and accuracy requirements to dynamically choose the most suitable
model. Our approach presents two different methods, namely Green AI dynamic
model cascading and Green AI dynamic model routing. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach via a proof of concept empirical example based on
a real-world dataset. Our results show that Green AI dynamic model selection
can achieve substantial energy savings (up to ~25%) while substantially
retaining the accuracy of the most energy greedy solution (up to ~95%). As
conclusion, our preliminary findings highlight the potential that hybrid,
adaptive model selection strategies withhold to mitigate the energy demands of

### [80] [The three main doctrines on the future of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20050)
*Alex Amadori,Eva Behrens,Gabriel Alfour,Andrea Miotti*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了关于人工智能风险的专家观点分类法，重点关注通用人工智能和超级人工智能，识别出三种主要学说：支配学说、灭绝学说和替代学说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了澄清专家们对AI发展后果预期规模和性质的核心分歧，系统化分析不同观点。

Method: 基于原始资料分析，识别并分类三种主要风险学说，考察每种学说的假设和论证。

Result: 建立了清晰的风险分类框架，明确了支配学说、灭绝学说和替代学说的核心特征和差异。

Conclusion: 虽然学说边界有时模糊，但该分类法有助于理解专家们在AI风险预期上的主要分歧点。

Abstract: This paper develops a taxonomy of expert perspectives on the risks and likely
consequences of artificial intelligence, with particular focus on Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). Drawing from
primary sources, we identify three predominant doctrines: (1) The dominance
doctrine, which predicts that the first actor to create sufficiently advanced
AI will attain overwhelming strategic superiority sufficient to cheaply
neutralize its opponents' defenses; (2) The extinction doctrine, which
anticipates that humanity will likely lose control of ASI, leading to the
extinction of the human species or its permanent disempowerment; (3) The
replacement doctrine, which forecasts that AI will automate a large share of
tasks currently performed by humans, but will not be so transformative as to
fundamentally reshape or bring an end to human civilization. We examine the
assumptions and arguments underlying each doctrine, including expectations
around the pace of AI progress and the feasibility of maintaining advanced AI
under human control. While the boundaries between doctrines are sometimes
porous and many experts hedge across them, this taxonomy clarifies the core
axes of disagreement over the anticipated scale and nature of the consequences
of AI development.

### [81] [Affective Computing and Emotional Data: Challenges and Implications in Privacy Regulations, The AI Act, and Ethics in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20153)
*Nicola Fabiano*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将情商整合到人工智能系统中的研究，重点关注情感计算和大型语言模型识别及响应人类情绪的能力，分析了情绪识别的神经网络架构，并讨论了情绪数据处理的法律和伦理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索人工智能系统如何更好地理解和响应人类情绪，以提升人机交互的质量，同时关注情绪数据处理中的隐私和伦理挑战。

Method: 研究方法基于跨学科分析，结合计算机科学、心理学和神经科学，使用CNN处理面部表情，RNN处理语音和文本等序列数据，进行情绪识别。

Result: 研究结果表明，情绪数据可分为显性（研究环境中知情同意收集）和隐性（日常数字交互中被动收集），并指出情绪识别系统存在文化差异和人口统计偏差的挑战。

Conclusion: 结论强调情绪数据应被视为敏感个人数据，需在GDPR和EU AI Act框架下加强法律保障，包括目的限制、数据最小化和有意义的同意机制。

Abstract: This paper examines the integration of emotional intelligence into artificial
intelligence systems, with a focus on affective computing and the growing
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, to
recognize and respond to human emotions. Drawing on interdisciplinary research
that combines computer science, psychology, and neuroscience, the study
analyzes foundational neural architectures - CNNs for processing facial
expressions and RNNs for sequential data, such as speech and text - that enable
emotion recognition. It examines the transformation of human emotional
experiences into structured emotional data, addressing the distinction between
explicit emotional data collected with informed consent in research settings
and implicit data gathered passively through everyday digital interactions.
That raises critical concerns about lawful processing, AI transparency, and
individual autonomy over emotional expressions in digital environments. The
paper explores implications across various domains, including healthcare,
education, and customer service, while addressing challenges of cultural
variations in emotional expression and potential biases in emotion recognition
systems across different demographic groups. From a regulatory perspective, the
paper examines emotional data in the context of the GDPR and the EU AI Act
frameworks, highlighting how emotional data may be considered sensitive
personal data that requires robust safeguards, including purpose limitation,
data minimization, and meaningful consent mechanisms.

### [82] [AIRwaves at CheckThat! 2025: Retrieving Scientific Sources for Implicit Claims on Social Media with Dual Encoders and Neural Re-Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19509)
*Cem Ashbaugh,Leon Baumgärtner,Tim Gress,Nikita Sidorov,Daniel Werner*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种两阶段检索方法，将基于E5-large的双编码器密集检索与SciBERT交叉编码器神经重排序相结合，显著提升了社交媒体推文到科学论文的匹配效果，在CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab任务中取得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上隐式科学声明与原始论文的链接对于基于证据的事实核查和学术讨论至关重要，但受到词汇稀疏性、短查询和领域特定语言的阻碍。

Method: 采用两阶段检索管道：第一阶段使用基于E5-large的双编码器进行密集检索，通过批内和挖掘的困难负样本进行微调，并增强分块标记化和丰富文档元数据；第二阶段使用SciBERT交叉编码器进行神经重排序。

Result: 该方法在黄金标签盲测集上达到MRR@5 = 0.6828，显著优于基线BM25的0.5025，纯神经表示方法达到0.6174。

Conclusion: 将密集检索与神经重排序器结合为推文到研究匹配提供了强大高效的解决方案，并为未来证据检索管道提供了实用蓝图。

Abstract: Linking implicit scientific claims made on social media to their original
publications is crucial for evidence-based fact-checking and scholarly
discourse, yet it is hindered by lexical sparsity, very short queries, and
domain-specific language. Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the
CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly
outperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval
baseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To
surpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a
first stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using
in-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and
rich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT
cross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations
lifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves
to MRR@5 = 0.6828. The findings demonstrate that coupling dense retrieval with
neural re-rankers delivers a powerful and efficient solution for tweet-to-study
matching and provides a practical blueprint for future evidence-retrieval
pipelines.

### [83] [Learning Contextual Retrieval for Robust Conversational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19700)
*Seunghan Yang,Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Kyuhong Shim,Minsoo Kim,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出ContextualRetriever，一种新型的基于LLM的检索器，通过直接融入对话上下文来解决多轮对话搜索中的用户意图理解问题，在保持检索性能的同时不增加推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话搜索中用户经常使用缩写和话题转换，传统检索器难以准确理解用户意图。现有的查询重写技术计算成本高，而LLM检索器在话题漂移或上下文模糊时表现不佳。

Method: 提出ContextualRetriever，包含：(1)上下文感知嵌入机制，突出当前查询在对话历史中的重要性；(2)基于高质量重写查询的意图引导监督；(3)保持基础LLM生成能力的训练策略。

Result: 在多个对话搜索基准测试上的广泛评估表明，ContextualRetriever显著优于现有方法，且不产生额外的推理开销。

Conclusion: ContextualRetriever通过直接整合对话上下文有效解决了多轮对话检索中的意图理解挑战，在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Effective conversational search demands a deep understanding of user intent
across multiple dialogue turns. Users frequently use abbreviations and shift
topics in the middle of conversations, posing challenges for conventional
retrievers. While query rewriting techniques improve clarity, they often incur
significant computational cost due to additional autoregressive steps.
Moreover, although LLM-based retrievers demonstrate strong performance, they
are not explicitly optimized to track user intent in multi-turn settings, often
failing under topic drift or contextual ambiguity. To address these
limitations, we propose ContextualRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever that
directly incorporates conversational context into the retrieval process. Our
approach introduces: (1) a context-aware embedding mechanism that highlights
the current query within the dialogue history; (2) intent-guided supervision
based on high-quality rewritten queries; and (3) a training strategy that
preserves the generative capabilities of the base LLM. Extensive evaluations
across multiple conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that
ContextualRetriever significantly outperforms existing methods while incurring
no additional inference overhead.

*Alireza Heidari,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FusedANN是一个几何框架，通过将属性过滤提升为ANN优化约束，引入凸融合空间，实现向量相似性和属性过滤的高效混合查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中需要结合向量相似性和属性过滤的混合查询，现有解决方案在召回率、速度和灵活性之间存在权衡，依赖脆弱的索引技巧且无法扩展。

Method: 通过拉格朗日松弛引入凸融合空间，使用基于transformer的凸化方法联合嵌入属性和向量，将硬过滤器转化为连续的加权惩罚，保持top-k语义的同时实现高效近似搜索。

Result: FusedANN在标准混合基准测试中消除了脆弱的过滤阶段，实现了优越的召回率-延迟权衡，比最先进的混合和图基系统吞吐量提高3倍，召回率更好。

Conclusion: FusedANN在符号约束和向量相似性之间建立了原则性、可扩展和可验证的桥梁，为大规模、混合和动态NLP/ML工作负载开启了新一代过滤检索系统。

Abstract: Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands
hybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g.,
"top document in category X, from 2023"). Current solutions trade off recall,
speed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We
introduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric
framework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and
introduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method
jointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based
convexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that
preserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove
that FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully
relaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient,
and preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically,
FusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages,
achieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks
without specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and
better recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems.
Theoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules
that make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled,
scalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector
similarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large,
hybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了推荐系统中"人在回路"监督模式的新风险，指出这种监督方式可能因信息环境而增加级联故障的可能性，并分析了三种常见部署情境下的独特动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然推荐系统设计中广泛采用"人在回路"范式来解决问责问题，但作者认为这种人类监督也带来了尚未充分描述的新风险，这些风险与系统部署的信息环境共同决定。

Method: 作者回顾了人类监督的局限性如何增加级联故障的可能性，并分析了三种常见部署情境下的独特动态如何使人类监督更容易失败。

Result: 研究发现"人在回路"实践在实现社会责任推荐方面可能不足，人类监督的局限性在特定信息环境下会增加系统故障风险。

Conclusion: 文章最后提出了两个建议，旨在改进推荐系统中的人类监督机制以减少潜在风险。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most commonly deployed systems today.
Systems design approaches to AI-powered recommender systems have done well to
urge recommender system developers to follow more intentional data collection,
curation, and management procedures. So too has the "human-in-the-loop"
paradigm been widely adopted, primarily to address the issue of accountability.
However, in this paper, we take the position that human oversight in
recommender system design also entails novel risks that have yet to be fully
described. These risks are "codetermined" by the information context in which
such systems are often deployed. Furthermore, new knowledge of the shortcomings
of "human-in-the-loop" practices to deliver meaningful oversight of other AI
systems suggest that they may also be inadequate for achieving socially
responsible recommendations. We review how the limitations of human oversight
may increase the chances of a specific kind of failure: a "cascade" or
"compound" failure. We then briefly explore how the unique dynamics of three
common deployment contexts can make humans in the loop more likely to fail in
their oversight duties. We then conclude with two recommendations.

*Qihang Zhao,Xiaoyang Zheng,Ben Chen,Zhongbo Sun,Chenyi Lei*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种上下文扩散净化器（CDP），用于解决搜索系统中用户行为序列存在的曝光偏差、类别漂移和上下文噪声问题，通过前向加噪和条件反向去噪过程生成动态的、上下文感知的兴趣表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要遵循'识别-聚合'范式，假设序列不变地反映用户偏好，但忽略了噪声与真实兴趣的有机纠缠，且输出静态的、上下文无关的表示，无法适应动态意图变化。

Method: CDP将类别过滤后的行为视为'受污染的观测'，采用前向加噪和条件反向去噪过程，通过跨交互特征（查询×用户×项目×上下文）引导，可控地生成纯净的、上下文感知的兴趣表示。

Result: 广泛的离线和在线实验表明，CDP优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: CDP能够有效解决用户行为序列中的噪声问题，生成动态适应的兴趣表示，提升搜索系统的性能。

Abstract: User behavior sequences in search systems resemble "interest fossils",
capturing genuine intent yet eroded by exposure bias, category drift, and
contextual noise. Current methods predominantly follow an "identify-aggregate"
paradigm, assuming sequences immutably reflect user preferences while
overlooking the organic entanglement of noise and genuine interest. Moreover,
they output static, context-agnostic representations, failing to adapt to
dynamic intent shifts under varying Query-User-Item-Context conditions.
  To resolve this dual challenge, we propose the Contextual Diffusion Purifier
(CDP). By treating category-filtered behaviors as "contaminated observations",
CDP employs a forward noising and conditional reverse denoising process guided
by cross-interaction features (Query x User x Item x Context), controllably
generating pure, context-aware interest representations that dynamically evolve
with scenarios. Extensive offline/online experiments demonstrate the
superiority of CDP over state-of-the-art methods.

*Renxiang Wang,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级管道方法，通过集成文档检索、模块化代码生成和错误精炼，显著提升了中小型开源LLM在零样本形式化规划任务中的性能，特别是在PDDL规划语言生成方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数参数少于500亿的开源LLM在零样本形式化规划任务中表现接近零，主要原因是规划语言（如PDDL）的低资源特性。需要开发有效方法来提升这些模型在形式化规划任务中的性能。

Method: 采用一系列轻量级管道，整合文档检索、模块化代码生成和错误精炼技术。通过检索相关文档来增强模型对规划语言的理解，采用模块化方式生成代码，并通过迭代精炼过程修正错误。

Result: 使用Llama-4-Maverick等模型，在BlocksWorld领域的最佳管道将规划正确率从0%提升到超过80%。虽然语法错误大幅减少，但在更具挑战性的领域中语义错误仍然存在。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了中小型LLM在形式化规划任务中的表现，但揭示了当前模型在推理能力方面的根本局限性，特别是在处理复杂语义错误方面的不足。

Abstract: Certain strong LLMs have shown promise for zero-shot formal planning by
generating planning languages like PDDL. Yet, performance of most open-source
models under 50B parameters has been reported to be close to zero due to the
low-resource nature of these languages. We significantly improve their
performance via a series of lightweight pipelines that integrates documentation
retrieval with modular code generation and error refinement. With models like
Llama-4-Maverick, our best pipeline improves plan correctness from 0\% to over
80\% on the common BlocksWorld domain. However, while syntactic errors are
substantially reduced, semantic errors persist in more challenging domains,
revealing fundamental limitations in current models' reasoning
capabilities.\footnote{Our code and data can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何在联邦推荐中有效整合多模态特征，同时应对效率、分布异质性和细粒度对齐等挑战。

Method: 将多模态表示学习卸载到服务器端，使用高容量编码器生成表达性表示；采用基于用户分组的项目表示融合方法实现细粒度知识共享；提出可插入现有联邦推荐系统的融合损失函数。

Result: 在五个公共基准数据集上的实验表明，GFMFR持续优于最先进的多模态联邦推荐基线方法。

Conclusion: GFMFR通过创新的多模态融合机制，有效提升了联邦推荐系统的性能，同时保持了隐私保护特性。

Abstract: Federated Recommendation (FR) is a new learning paradigm to tackle the
learn-to-rank problem in a privacy-preservation manner. How to integrate
multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open
challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained
alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion
mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it
offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item
content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive
representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item
representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among
similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss
could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems
empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive
experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.

*Jarne Mathi Decker*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在推荐系统中通过添加算法特征来改进算法选择的方法，发现虽然算法特征能提高Top-1选择准确率，但用户特征在整体性能中仍占主导地位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中的算法选择问题，传统元学习方法将算法视为黑盒，忽略了算法本身的多样性特征。

Method: 构建了包含静态代码指标、抽象语法树属性、行为性能特征和高层概念特征的全面算法特征集，在五个数据集上比较了仅使用用户特征的基线模型和使用用户+算法特征的模型。

Result: 添加算法特征的元学习器平均NDCG@10为0.143，比单最佳算法基线提高11.7%，但与仅使用用户特征的模型(0.144)相比没有提升。算法特征提高了Top-1选择准确率(+16.1%)但降低了Top-3准确率(-10.7%)。

Conclusion: 在推荐系统的个性化算法选择任务中，用户特征的预测能力占主导地位，算法特征虽能提高选择精度，但要提升整体性能仍面临挑战。

Abstract: The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is
optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem.
Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm
based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms
themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the
impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set
to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code
metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and
high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five
datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both
user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented
with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically
significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline
(0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not
lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user
features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did
improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by
leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user
algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user
features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection
precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a
non-trivial challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推荐系统在处理冗余和无关信息方面存在不足，直接融合或刚性分离的方法无法有效过滤噪声和建模模态间复杂交互。

Method: 首先使用多模态信息瓶颈压缩输入表示以过滤任务无关噪声，然后将信息分解为独特、冗余和协同三个组件，并通过相应的学习目标进行优化。

Result: 在多个竞争性模型和三个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了MRdIB在增强多模态推荐方面的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: MRdIB框架能够学习更强大和解缠的表示，有效提升多模态推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by
integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item
characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and
irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods
either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural
separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model
the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled
Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal
Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively
filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information.
Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the
recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We
achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information
learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information
learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning
objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives,
MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations.
Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in
enhancing multimodal recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐参与涉及多种互动形式，社交媒体平台提供了观察自然对话的机会。Reddit的匿名性促进了多样化的参与，产生了丰富的音乐讨论，但大规模数据需要有效工具进行分析。

Method: 开发Muse-it平台，通过用户定义查询检索Reddit数据，支持主题建模、时间趋势分析和聚类，同时识别音乐相关超链接并获取曲目级元数据（艺术家、专辑、流派、歌词等）。

Result: Muse-it能够有效聚合跨子版块的帖子，提供动态可视化界面，使研究人员能够高效研究大规模音乐讨论。

Conclusion: Muse-it为音乐研究人员提供了一种可访问的方式来收集和分析大数据，为理解在线自然展开的音乐参与开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Music engagement spans diverse interactions with music, from selection and
emotional response to its impact on behavior, identity, and social connections.
Social media platforms provide spaces where such engagement can be observed in
natural, unprompted conversations. Advances in natural language processing
(NLP) and big data analytics make it possible to analyze these discussions at
scale, extending music research to broader contexts. Reddit, in particular,
offers anonymity that encourages diverse participation and yields rich
discourse on music in ecological settings. Yet the scale of this data requires
tools to extract, process, and analyze it effectively. We present Muse-it, a
platform that retrieves comprehensive Reddit data centered on user-defined
queries. It aggregates posts from across subreddits, supports topic modeling,
temporal trend analysis, and clustering, and enables efficient study of
large-scale discourse. Muse-it also identifies music-related hyperlinks (e.g.,
Spotify), retrieves track-level metadata such as artist, album, release date,
genre, popularity, and lyrics, and links these to the discussions. An
interactive interface provides dynamic visualizations of the collected data.
Muse-it thus offers an accessible way for music researchers to gather and
analyze big data, opening new avenues for understanding music engagement as it
naturally unfolds online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在求解PDE时使用启发式惩罚项，缺乏物理一致性。针对非平衡涨落系统，需要一种与涨落结构一致的惩罚策略。

Method: 基于大偏差原理，提出物理信息化的惩罚项选择方法，构建热力学一致的PINNs扩展THINNs，并进行后验分析和实证比较。

Result: 建立了分析后验估计，并通过实证比较验证了THINNs相对于传统惩罚策略的优势。

Conclusion: THINNs为PINNs提供了热力学一致的框架，能够更有效地处理非平衡涨落系统的PDE求解问题。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize
the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems,
we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with
the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations
principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the
penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being
selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of
PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a
posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established
penalization strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于扩散模型的强化学习框架WFDiffuser，通过引入频率域特征来解决现有方法仅关注时域特征导致的频率偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散概率模型的离线强化学习方法主要关注时域特征，而忽略了频率域特征，这会导致频率偏移和性能下降。作者观察到仅使用时域的方法会在频率域的低频分量中引入偏移，从而导致轨迹不稳定和性能退化。

Method: 提出Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser)框架，集成离散小波变换将轨迹分解为低频和高频分量，使用短时傅里叶变换和交叉注意力机制提取频率域特征并促进跨频率交互。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试上的大量实验结果表明，WFDiffuser有效缓解了频率偏移问题，产生了更平滑、更稳定的轨迹，并在决策性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 从频率域的新视角研究强化学习问题，WFDiffuser通过结合小波变换和傅里叶变换，成功解决了现有扩散模型在强化学习中的频率偏移问题，提升了轨迹质量和决策性能。

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline
reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking
frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance
according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from
a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that
time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency
components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and
degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier
Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates
Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and
high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each
component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention
mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency
interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate
that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,
more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money
laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it
can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based
systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper
explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in
the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML
systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the
sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these
challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link
analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the
utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness
Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the
system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the
influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The
significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial
sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional
AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new
implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively
structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the
context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the
prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of
emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This
integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by
refining their capabilities.

### [95] [DeepACTIF: Efficient Feature Attribution via Activation Traces in Neural Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19362)
*Benedikt W. Hosp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepACTIF是一种轻量级、架构感知的特征归因方法，专为时间序列模型设计，通过利用LSTM内部激活来高效估计特征重要性，在计算效率和准确性上显著优于SHAP、IG等传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准特征归因方法（如Integrated Gradients和SHAP）计算量大，不适合实时应用，特别是在医疗、生物识别等时间序列领域需要高效可解释性的场景。

Method: 提出DeepACTIF方法，针对LSTM网络设计逆加权聚合方案，强调跨时间步激活的稳定性和幅度，利用模型内部激活来高效估计特征重要性。

Result: 在三个生物识别凝视数据集上的评估显示，DeepACTIF在严重特征缩减（前10%特征）下保持预测性能，在准确性和统计鲁棒性上显著优于SHAP、IG和DeepLIFT，计算时间和内存使用量降低数个数量级。

Conclusion: DeepACTIF是边缘设备（如移动XR头显或嵌入式健康监测器）上实现实时可解释性的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models,
particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and
human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated
Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for
real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and
architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal
activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently.
Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation
scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time
steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF
not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top
10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods,
including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical
robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we
demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with
significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our
experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and
memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when
using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for
real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or
embedded health monitors.

*Zhuqi Wang,Qinghe Zhang,Zhuopei Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于增强ANFIS的混合分析方法来检测信用卡欺诈，通过多分辨率小波分解和时间注意力机制改进传统ANFIS框架，显著降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信用卡欺诈对美国家庭财务状况构成严重威胁，导致家庭经济行为发生不可预测的变化，需要更有效的检测方法。

Method: 使用增强ANFIS模型，结合多分辨率小波分解模块和时间注意力机制，对历史交易数据和宏观经济指标进行离散小波变换，生成局部经济冲击信号，并通过深度模糊规则库进行推理。

Result: 实验结果显示，与局部神经模糊模型和传统LSTM模型相比，RMSE降低了17.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过集成小波基选择、时间相关权重和模糊规则激活，有效提升了欺诈检测的准确性和长期时间依赖关系的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the
financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in
household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid
analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes
several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a
multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention
mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical
transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic
shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule
library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian
membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that
adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns,
increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference
stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and
anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from
classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates
fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal
correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show
that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and
conventional LSTM models.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of unsupervised outlier detection
methods in audit analytics, utilizing USA spending data from the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a case example. We employ and
compare multiple outlier detection algorithms, including Histogram-based
Outlier Score (HBOS), Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum
Covariance Determinant (MCD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify
anomalies in federal spending patterns. The research addresses the growing need
for efficient and accurate anomaly detection in large-scale governmental
datasets, where traditional auditing methods may fall short. Our methodology
involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation
using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid
approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and
accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study
contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the
comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating
the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality
and efficiency. The findings have implications for auditors, policymakers, and
researchers seeking to leverage advanced analytics in governmental financial
oversight and risk management.

Motivation: 评估当前最先进的幻觉检测方法的真实有效性，揭示其性能可能受到伪相关性的影响，并提出改进的评估指南。

Method: 通过控制伪相关性效应，比较最先进方法与监督线性探针在RAGTruth数据集上的性能，分析超参数调优需求和分布外泛化能力。

Result: 控制伪相关性后，最先进方法的表现与监督线性探针相当，但需要大量超参数调优。所有方法在分布外泛化方面表现接近随机水平。

Conclusion: 当前幻觉检测方法的实际效果有限，分布外泛化能力不足，需要制定更严格的评估指南来推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: We critically assess the efficacy of the current SOTA in hallucination
detection and find that its performance on the RAGTruth dataset is largely
driven by a spurious correlation with data. Controlling for this effect,
state-of-the-art performs no better than supervised linear probes, while
requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Out-of-distribution
generalization is currently out of reach, with all of the analyzed methods
performing close to random. We propose a set of guidelines for hallucination
detection and its evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于近似贝叶斯计算（ABC）的方法，用于改进大型语言模型（LLMs）在不确定性表达方面的表现，特别是在临床诊断等高风险领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在表达不确定性方面存在困难，特别是在高风险和安全关键领域如临床诊断中，现有的基线方法（如模型logits和引导概率）往往产生过度自信且校准不良的估计。

Method: 采用近似贝叶斯计算（ABC），一种无需似然的贝叶斯推断方法，将LLMs视为随机模拟器来推断预测概率的后验分布。

Result: 在两个临床相关基准测试中（合成口腔病变诊断数据集和公开的GretelAI症状到诊断数据集），ABC方法相比标准基线方法，准确率提高了46.9%，Brier分数降低了74.4%，并通过预期校准误差（ECE）和预测熵提高了校准性能。

Conclusion: ABC方法有效改善了LLMs在不确定性表达方面的表现，为高风险领域的可靠部署提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often
struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in
high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing
standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities
produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference,
based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior
distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on
two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset
and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to
standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces
Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected
Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

Motivation: 解决RAG（检索增强生成）系统中存在的时间性故障问题，特别是在网络安全领域，数据的时间敏感性对系统性能有重要影响。

Method: 采用两种方法：1）简单的新近度先验方法；2）用于主题演化的聚类启发式方法。在网络安全数据上进行测试。

Result: 新近度先验方法在新鲜度任务上表现优异，准确率达到1.00；而聚类启发式方法在趋势检测任务上表现很差，F1分数仅为0.08。

Conclusion: 趋势检测任务需要比简单启发式方法更复杂的技术，新近度先验方法在处理数据新鲜度方面有效，但对于主题演化等复杂时间模式检测效果不佳。

Abstract: We address temporal failures in RAG systems using two methods on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习（IL）算法需要专家状态和动作信息，但在实际应用中专家动作信息往往难以获取。因此，从观察学习（LfO）或仅状态模仿学习（SOIL）的概念应运而生，旨在仅使用专家状态访问信息进行学习。

Method: 本文提出了一个LfO框架，用于分类和调查现有的LfO方法，重点分析了轨迹构建、假设和算法设计选择。同时，还探讨了LfO与离线强化学习、基于模型的强化学习和分层强化学习等相关领域的联系。

Result: 通过框架分析，本文对现有LfO方法进行了系统分类，并指出了该领域的研究现状和挑战。

Conclusion: 本文利用提出的框架识别了LfO领域的开放性问题，并提出了未来的研究方向，为相关研究提供了理论支持和方法指导。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent
by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL
algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert
demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance,
requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world
applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this
limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only
imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator
only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we
present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO
methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's
design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related
fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our
framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

TL;DR: TensLoRA是一个统一的框架，将LoRA更新聚合为高阶张量，建模广泛的基于张量的低秩适配方法，支持模态特定的压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法将注意力投影（Query、Key、Value）和每层的适配矩阵视为独立，缺乏系统性的联合张量适配框架。

Method: 引入TensLoRA框架，将LoRA更新聚合为高阶张量，支持模态特定的压缩率，允许根据模态和任务定制参数预算。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，张量构建直接影响性能，有时在相似参数数量下优于标准LoRA。

Conclusion: TensLoRA提供了一个系统化的张量适配框架，能够更有效地进行Transformer适配，并在多模态任务中展现优势。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers
by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While
effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention
projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have
considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and
without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that
aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of
tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing
tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing
parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task.
Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor
construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA
under similar parameter counts.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is critical for edge and High Performance Computing
(HPC) where data is not centralized and privacy is crucial. We present OmniFed,
a modular framework designed around decoupling and clear separation of concerns
for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic. Its
architecture supports configuration-driven prototyping and code-level

mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and popular training
algorithms. It also offers optional privacy mechanisms including Differential
Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well
as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined
extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration,
learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the
integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to
measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration,
mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed

TL;DR: TimeMosaic是一个多变量时间序列预测框架，通过自适应补丁嵌入和分段解码来解决时间异质性问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的方法采用固定长度分割，忽略了局部时间动态的异质性和预测的解码异质性，导致信息密集区域细节丢失、稳定段冗余，无法捕捉短期和长期预测的不同复杂性。

Method: TimeMosaic使用自适应补丁嵌入根据局部信息密度动态调整粒度，平衡模式重用和结构清晰度；引入分段解码，将每个预测视界视为相关子任务，适应特定视界的难度和信息需求。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，TimeMosaic相比现有方法带来了一致的改进，使用3210亿观测值的大规模语料库训练的模型达到了与最先进TSFM竞争的性能。

Conclusion: TimeMosaic通过处理时间异质性，在多变量时间序列预测中实现了更好的性能，证明了自适应粒度调整和分段解码策略的有效性。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance,
transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods
typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of
local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such
designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in
stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term
and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that
aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch
embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information
density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving
temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that
treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to
horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying
a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing
methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion
observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信用违约数据集通常存在严重的类别不平衡问题（违约者远少于非违约者），这会影响机器学习模型的预测性能。研究旨在找到最适合处理此类不平衡数据的方法组合。

Method: 使用真实信用违约数据集，在应用三种重采样技术（SMOTE、SMOTE-Tomek、ADASYN）前后，评估多种机器学习模型（包括传统分类器和集成提升算法），结合Boruta特征选择和DBSCAN异常检测。

Result: Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM组合模型在所有评估指标上表现最优：F1-score 82.56%、G-mean 82.98%、ROC-AUC 90.90%、PR-AUC 91.85%。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更稳健的信用违约预测系统奠定了基础，随着全球信用交易的增加，这些发现对未来系统开发具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques,
namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the
class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit
default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much
smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating
machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to
establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference
point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition
to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting
algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient
Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using
Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and
after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the
University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and
their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model
performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and
F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the
Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models
(F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit
default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in
creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be
essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率预测模型未能充分捕捉数据和模型选择带来的不确定性，需要系统评估不同不确定性量化方法在电力价格预测中的效果。

Method: 使用深度分布神经网络(DDNNs)结合集成方法、MC dropout和conformal prediction，以及LASSO估计的自回归(LEAR)方法结合QRA、GARCH和conformal prediction。

Result: LEAR模型在概率预测方面表现优异，DDNNs通过结合不确定性改进预测性能，conformal prediction方法能最好地量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 所有模型都表现竞争力，但相对性能取决于点预测和概率预测的度量标准选择。

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management,
and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for
this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of
uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent
of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model
and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty
quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic
forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In
particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment
them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal
prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the
LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile
regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of
performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms
of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification
method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data
and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting.
Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal
prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under
consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance
depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的深度学习方法，通过建模分布偏移概率和网络正确性条件概率，构建二叉树结构来更准确地评估深度学习系统在真实部署环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在基准测试中表现优异，但在实际部署中由于对微小分布偏移的敏感性而表现不佳，现有评估方法未能充分考虑这种偏移，导致性能指标虚高。

Method: 通过估计分布外检测器的输出概率来建模运行时分布偏移的发生概率，结合网络正确性的条件概率，构建二叉树结构进行遍历计算，从而获得更可信和精确的网络精度估计。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于传统评估方法，精度估计误差通常在0.01到0.1之间。在医学分割基准测试中，通过将成本与树节点关联，成功应用于风险评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习系统提供了更可靠的性能评估和可操作的风险评估框架，特别是在安全关键应用中，有助于提高系统的可靠性和可信度。

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks
often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often
imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These
shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during
evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we
propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk
assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the
incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability
from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with
conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary
tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of
network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which
we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of
distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional
evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and
0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical
segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by
associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and
value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for
improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems,
particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate

TL;DR: 本文评估了跨频迁移学习在时间序列预测中的表现，发现当前基准测试存在缺陷，统计模型及其集成方法在多个数据集上优于现有基础预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前跨频迁移学习的基准测试实践存在不足，包括对小规模评估数据集的过度依赖、样本大小处理不当、报告次优统计模型以及未能考虑预训练和测试数据集重叠的风险。

Method: 重新实现了广泛采用的神经预测网络，使其适应CFTL设置；仅在专有和合成数据上进行预训练，避免测试泄漏；在15个大型多样的公共预测竞赛数据集上进行评估。

Result: 统计模型的准确性经常被低估。统计模型及其集成方法在sCRPS上比现有FFMs高出8.2%以上，在MASE上高出20%以上。但合成数据集预训练确实将FFM的准确性提高了7%。

Conclusion: 虽然统计模型在当前基准测试中表现优于神经基础预测模型，但合成数据预训练对FFMs有显著改进作用，表明CFTL框架仍有潜力。

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework
for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation
forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current
benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This
shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation
datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary
statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account
for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To
address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of
widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup;
we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent
test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition
datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is
frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their
ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and
by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic
dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

TL;DR: DELTAformer是一种针对多变量时间序列的Transformer改进方法，通过委托令牌注意力机制限制变量间建模，实现线性扩展并提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多变量时间序列中变量数量扩展性瓶颈和变量间无差别混合导致的噪声积累和性能下降问题

Method: 使用委托令牌约束变量间建模能力，委托令牌作为隐式正则化器，迫使模型高度选择性地传播变量间信息，同时进行完整的时序建模

Result: DELTAformer在变量数量上实现线性扩展，性能优于标准Transformer，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，在噪声环境下表现更好

Conclusion: 通过将模型设计与多变量时间序列的领域特定挑战对齐，DELTAformer能够同时实现线性扩展和性能提升

Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer
modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing
consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a
potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is
likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many
MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from
indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While
scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in
transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by
strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable
mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention
(DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate
tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal
modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model
to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to
propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales
linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard
transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and
baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than
standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior
noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by
aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our
advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually
improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的混合整数线性规划（MILP）公式，显著减少了局部离群因子（LOF）目标组件中的约束数量，从而提高了反事实解释的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的合理反事实解释方法虽然通过考虑数据分布特征提高了现实性，但其优化模型引入了大量约束，导致计算成本高昂。

Method: 重新审视DACE框架，提出精炼的MILP公式，减少LOF目标组件的约束数量，并将其应用于带有标准缩放器的线性SVM分类器。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持解释质量的同时实现了更快的求解时间。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了在反事实解释和数据科学应用中更高效的LOF建模的前景。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a widely used post-hoc method that
provides individuals with actionable changes to alter an unfavorable prediction
from a machine learning model. Plausible CE methods improve realism by
considering data distribution characteristics, but their optimization models
introduce a large number of constraints, leading to high computational cost. In
this work, we revisit the DACE framework and propose a refined Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that significantly reduces the number of
constraints in the local outlier factor (LOF) objective component. We also
apply the method to a linear SVM classifier with standard scaler. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves faster solving times while
maintaining explanation quality. These results demonstrate the promise of more
efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子生成方法在严格等变性与可扩展性之间的权衡问题

Method: 提出三种框架扩散变体：全局框架扩散(GFD)、局部框架扩散(LFD)、不变框架扩散(IFD)，并使用EdgeDiT增强表达能力

Result: GFD+EdgeDiT在QM9上达到测试NLL -137.97/-141.85，原子稳定性98.98%，分子稳定性90.51%，采样速度比EDM快近2倍

Conclusion: 框架扩散为分子生成提供了可扩展、灵活且物理基础扎实的范式，凸显全局结构保持的重要性

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce
strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability
and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves
deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the
backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global
Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame
Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from
additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which
relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity,
we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale,
alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These
results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and
uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study
establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically
grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of
global structure preservation.

TL;DR: MCFM是一种学习耗散动力学的方法，通过将保守-耗散分裂构建到向量场和结构保持采样器中，确保不违反第一原理，从而在长期推演中保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经代理模型在长期推演中常常注入能量导致不稳定，MCFM旨在解决这一问题，确保动力学模拟的物理正确性和稳定性。

Method: MCFM通过条件流匹配在短时转换上训练，避免长时推演的反向传播。在推理时，采用Strang-prox方案交替进行辛更新和近端度量步骤，确保离散能量衰减。

Result: 在受控机械基准测试中，MCFM生成的相图更接近真实情况，能量增加和正能量率事件显著少于同等表达能力的无约束神经流，同时匹配终端分布拟合。

Conclusion: MCFM通过结构保持的采样器和参数化，在连续和离散时间上保证了守恒性、单调耗散和稳定推演，为学习耗散动力学提供了可靠的方法。

Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics
without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and
destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the
conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure
preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short
transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme
alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete
energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted
energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking
this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and
stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase
portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and
positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural
flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAWM是一种基于扩散的世界模型，通过生成状态-奖励轨迹并结合逆动力学模型进行动作推断，为基于一步TD学习的离线强化学习提供完整的合成转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的世界模型大多不直接生成动作，限制了其与标准基于值的离线RL算法的兼容性。虽然已有工作探索联合建模状态、奖励和动作，但这种方法往往导致训练复杂度增加和性能下降。

Method: 提出DAWM模型，生成基于当前状态、动作和回报的未来状态-奖励轨迹，同时使用逆动力学模型进行高效的动作推断。这种模块化设计产生适合一步TD学习的完整合成转换。

Result: 实验表明，保守的离线RL算法如TD3BC和IQL在使用这些增强轨迹训练时表现显著提升，在D4RL基准测试的多个任务中一致优于先前的基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: DAWM通过模块化设计有效解决了扩散世界模型与标准离线RL算法的兼容性问题，提供了一种计算高效且性能优越的训练方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement
learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions
alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard
value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference
(TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards,
and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased
training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose
\textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward
trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired
with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This
modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step
TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training.
Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and
IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories,
consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple
tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Motivation: 研究深度学习模型如何随时间学习，特别是训练过程中一个训练样本如何影响另一个样本的学习过程，类似于分析力如何移动物体。

Method: 使用力分析的思想，将模型训练过程中样本间的影响分解为两个部分：样本间的相似性和更新强度，并建立相应的分析框架。

Result: 该框架能够解释多种模型行为，包括某些样本的非平凡学习路径、LLM微调方法的有效性、简单结构化模式更容易学习等现象，并在各种学习任务中发现了改进模型训练的新策略。

Conclusion: 虽然该方法仍在发展中，但它提供了一种系统解释模型行为的新途径，有助于更好地理解深度学习模型的学习机制。

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas
inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training
procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like
analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how
similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This
framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in
different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have
non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work,
and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We
apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for
improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new
way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

Motivation: 在合成生物学等应用中，虽然模块的输入/输出函数和信号未知，但系统的组合架构知识可以显著减少学习系统输入/输出映射所需的训练数据量。

Method: 引入模块可识别性概念，通过神经网络结合组合结构来学习模块的输入/输出函数，并提供理论保证。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少实验数据需求和允许模块识别，有望简化合成生物电路和多模块系统的设计。

Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has
input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the
modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the
composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data
required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules'
input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from
different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning
framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional
structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from
the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount
of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the
compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular
identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from
a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees
on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory
on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for
the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output
functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set
distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure
is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set
distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module
identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of
synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

Conclusion: 领域定制的多模态表示在抗体重新格式化预测中优于大型预训练模型，能够有效筛选候选抗体

Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part
assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from
a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can
expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant
engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not
guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be
synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning
framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody
from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both
antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol
that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world
antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large
pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple,
domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in
the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a
new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario,
our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling
prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的vMF哈希损失能够有效减少信息损失，提高时间序列索引的性能，代码已公开。

Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a
fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based
hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on
semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing
is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash
codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised
representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a
discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes,
but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a
von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data
to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss
and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The
designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF
distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each
semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/jmpq97/vmf-hashing

TL;DR: Mamba模型在长上下文扩展时性能显著下降，研究发现这与状态转移矩阵A的谱特性有关，而非离散化时间步的累积。作者提出谱缩放方法，通过调制A矩阵的谱来改善长上下文泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的注意力机制具有二次复杂度，促使开发了Mamba等次二次复杂度的状态空间模型。但Mamba在预训练未见的长上下文场景中性能急剧下降，需要解决其长度扩展敏感性问题。

Method: 通过分析状态空间动态的分布外行为，特别是状态转移矩阵A的参数化，建立了状态收敛行为与A矩阵谱的联系。提出谱缩放方法，对预训练Mamba模型中的A矩阵谱进行选择性调制。

Result: 谱缩放方法能显著改善Mamba在长上下文场景中的性能，在仅调制Δt失败的情况下仍能有效工作，验证了所提出的理论见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有结构化转移矩阵的状态空间模型提供了更好的长度泛化途径，通过谱调制解决了Mamba模型的长上下文扩展挑战。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has
motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic
scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a
leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of
language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly
deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during
pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension.
Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the
out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within
the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent
works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of
discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a
connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches
infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a
well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome
this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to
pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by
selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We
show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply
modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for
better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition
matrices.

Result: 在多变量时序基准测试中，TIMED生成的序列比现有最先进生成模型更真实、时序一致性更好。

Conclusion: TIMED通过集成多种生成技术，有效解决了时序数据生成的挑战，在质量和一致性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet
challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection,
where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data
generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal
distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that
govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework
that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture
global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network
trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through
next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial
feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real
and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All
components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for
sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both
unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results
across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED
generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than
state-of-the-art generative models.

Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research
area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series
forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation
when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the
intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting
forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured
Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of
subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial
correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph
representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph
Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation.
Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting
model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both
scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it
is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve
performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at
low running costs.

Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains
necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and
representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series
data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept
drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning
model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused
by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework
that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol
representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts,
and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding
deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better
performance where significant data shifting exists.

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a
fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on
categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods
do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to
prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we
propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet
expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our
method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure
accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is
prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish
theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet
expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein
and KS distances.

TL;DR: 该论文使用临床上下文（出院摘要）来评估胸部X光片诊断模型，发现模型在预测试概率低的情况下表现最佳，而在预测试概率高时表现较差，且模型可能依赖临床上下文作为捷径而非真正的诊断信号。

Motivation: 当前胸部X光片数据集的机器学习模型在平均性能上表现良好，但不足以证明其临床实用性。论文旨在通过临床上下文提供更全面的模型评估。

Method: 利用每次X光片前的出院摘要记录，推导每个X光片标签的“预测试概率”，作为临床医生解读X光片时可用上下文知识的代理指标。

Result: 模型在预测试概率低的病例上表现最佳，在预测试概率高的病例上表现较差；在平衡测试集上性能显著下降，表明模型可能依赖临床上下文作为捷径。

Conclusion: 使用临床笔记中的上下文进行分析是更严格、细粒度评估临床视觉模型的有前景的方向。

Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular
benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong
average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is
insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical
context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic
evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR
diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a
``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for
existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.
Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several
diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test
probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test
probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether
strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an
ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that
performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not
exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives
from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis,
using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more
rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

Motivation: 现有基于提示的联邦持续学习方法存在类知识一致性问题，包括跨客户端的类内分布差距和类间提示相关性，这加剧了时空遗忘。

Method: 提出C²Prompt方法，包含局部类分布补偿机制(LCDC)减少类内分布差异，以及类感知提示聚合方案(CPA)减轻类间知识混淆。

Result: 在多个联邦持续学习基准测试上取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: C²Prompt通过增强提示通信中的类知识一致性，有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的时空遗忘问题。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from
continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key
challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial
forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown
advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we
underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise
knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge
coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across
clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt
class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During
prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge
conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,
intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method
that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt
communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism
(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across
clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a
class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate
inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant
knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our

TL;DR: 本文分析了持续学习中的训练能力丧失问题，提出了基于梯度噪声和曲率波动控制的预测阈值方法，并开发了分层调度器来稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中随着任务演进，梯度步长不再带来改进，导致准确率停滞或下降，即使模型容量和监督足够。现有单一指标无法可靠预测训练能力丧失。

Method: 引入两个互补标准：批量大小感知的梯度噪声界限和曲率波动控制界限，结合形成分层预测阈值。基于此构建分层调度器，控制每层的有效步长在安全范围内。

Result: 该方法在CReLU、Wasserstein正则化和L2权重衰减等场景下稳定了训练并提高了准确率，学习率轨迹与典型衰减模式一致。

Conclusion: 提出的分层阈值方法能有效预测和防止训练能力丧失，比单一指标更可靠，为持续学习中的优化稳定性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps
no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades
despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam
through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian
rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios,
and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two
complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature
volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold
that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple
per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit,
stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU),
Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate
trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

TL;DR: 训练线性注意力Transformer解决矩阵补全任务，模型仅通过输入输出对学习，无需显式算法指导，最终发现统一的迭代求解器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer在上下文学习中的能力，验证其是否能从数据中隐式发现数学算法和求解策略

Method: 在数百万个掩码块矩阵补全任务上训练线性注意力Transformer，任务包括标量预测和Nyström外推，仅使用均方误差损失

Result: 模型学习到参数无关的更新规则，在三种计算机制下表现一致，证明具有二阶收敛性并降低分布式迭代复杂度

Conclusion: Transformer仅通过补全缺失块的任务就能隐式发现统一的、资源自适应的迭代求解器，展示了上下文学习的强大能力

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix
completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may
be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om
extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss;
it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that
the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling
reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational
regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation).
We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch
problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with
rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing
blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver
spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a
powerful capability of in-context learning.

TL;DR: 开发了X-MultiTask多任务元学习框架，用于估计个体化治疗效果，在脊柱融合和脊柱侧弯手术决策中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外科决策复杂，需要理解患者特征、干预措施和结果之间的因果关系。传统统计方法在处理复杂异质数据时存在局限，影响个体化治疗效果估计的准确性。

Method: 提出多任务元学习框架X-MultiTask，将每个手术决策建模为独立任务，同时学习跨任务的共享表示。在训练目标中融入逆概率加权以增强因果有效性。

Result: 在两个数据集上评估：脊柱融合数据集（1,017患者）中，前路组平均AUC最高（0.84），后路组保持竞争力（0.77）；AIS数据集（368患者）中，在所有领域均表现优越。治疗效果估计指标ε_NN-PEHE和ε_ATE均优于基线。

Conclusion: X-MultiTask通过提供稳健的患者特异性因果估计，为推进个性化外科护理和改善患者结果提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal
relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In
high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate
estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to
the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex,
heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning
framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision
(e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct
task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal
validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the
training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public
spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs.
posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset
(368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs.
non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves
the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive
performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in
treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$
(0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs
in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains,
with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902.
By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a
powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient
outcomes. The code is available at https://github.com/Wizaaard/X-MultiTask.

Conclusion: Frictional Q-learning通过物理直观的摩擦力约束有效解决了外推误差问题，同时保持了算法的简洁性。

Abstract: We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and
extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that
prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we
present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for
continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our
algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to
that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of
the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of
batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of
extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is
robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard
continuous control benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sobolev训练通过改善损失景观的几何特性来加速神经网络训练，这一优势不仅适用于浅层网络，也扩展到现代深度学习架构。

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss
functions, has been shown to accelerate convergence and improve generalization
compared to conventional $L^2$ training. However, the underlying mechanisms of
this training method remain only partially understood. In this work, we present
the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training
accelerates the convergence of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Under a
student-teacher framework with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, we
derive exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, and quantify the
improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow
convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical
findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep
learning tasks.

Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for
cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment
and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring.
Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks
definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis.
Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically
valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges,
including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and
the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose
PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent
space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate
ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade
dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than
118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease
annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG
translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led
evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve
diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world
cardiovascular screening.

Conclusion: Tanbr在连续决策空间中实现了次线性遗憾界，为稀疏专家混合模型的在线推理提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for
scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it
activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying
such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the
large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing,
especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online
inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing
error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural
bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE
inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates
the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide
task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large
continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to
progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then
applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to
model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that
\texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating
over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing
methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference
latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$},
while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RDAR提供了一种有效的方法来减少自动驾驶系统中的计算负担，同时保持决策质量，为高效智能体交互建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other
hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents,
regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on
the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to
reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention
mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally
computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent
relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled
vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a
pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov
Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent
selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate
its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving
comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and
performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of
the art behavior model.

Result: 在五个数学基准测试和两个模型上的实验表明，VCRL优于当前的LLM强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: VCRL通过模拟人类从易到难的学习过程，有效提升了LLM在数学推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models
reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but
require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in
high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter
(CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a
conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior
sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior
sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based
filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark
problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency
across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs提供了一种结构化和可解释的多变量函数逼近框架，但缺乏严格的理论收敛性分析。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 使用B样条表示单变量变换分量，分析加性和混合加性-乘性KANs的收敛性，推导最优节点数选择准则。

Result: 证明KANs在Sobolev光滑度r的函数空间中能达到最小最优收敛速率O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})，仿真研究验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 结果为KANs在非参数回归中的应用提供了理论基础，展示了其作为现有方法的结构化替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable
framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate
transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper
establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate
components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid
additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate
$O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We
further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the
B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the
predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for
using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a
structured alternative to existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了BoreaRL，这是首个用于气候适应性北方森林管理的多目标强化学习环境，揭示了碳目标比冻土保护目标更容易优化的不对称性，并展示了不同管理策略的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北方森林储存了30-40%的陆地碳，其中大部分存在于易受气候影响的永久冻土中。当前工具无法充分解决碳固存和冻土保护之间的复杂权衡问题。

Method: 开发了BoreaRL多目标强化学习环境，包含基于物理的耦合能量、碳和水通量模拟器，支持站点特定模式和通用模式两种训练范式，并评估了多种多目标RL算法。

Result: 发现碳目标比冻土保护目标显著更容易优化，在通用设置下标准偏好条件方法完全失败，而简单的课程学习方法通过策略性选择训练片段实现了更优性能。

Conclusion: 稳健的气候适应性森林管理对当前MORL方法仍具挑战性，BoreaRL为开发更有效方法提供了有价值的基准，并已开源以加速气候应用中的多目标RL研究。

Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable
permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation.
However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and
permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot
adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective
reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest
management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy,
carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms:
site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning
robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of
multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning
difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw
(permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing
minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings,
standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive
curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically
selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct
management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive
high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies
balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining
carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest
management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL
as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We
open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate
applications.

TL;DR: 本文对预训练Transformer模型在符号回归任务中的泛化能力进行了系统实证研究，发现在预训练分布内表现良好，但在分布外场景下性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在符号回归中显示出潜力，但其成功严重依赖预训练数据，对于预训练分布之外的泛化能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 对几种最先进的预训练Transformer符号回归方法进行系统实证评估，测试其在预训练分布内和一系列分布外挑战中的性能。

Result: 研究发现预训练模型在分布内表现良好，但在分布外场景下性能持续下降，存在显著的泛化差距。

Conclusion: 这种泛化差距是实践应用中的关键障碍，严重限制了预训练方法在现实世界应用中的实用性。

Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for
formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a
promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a
large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is
critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to
problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored.
In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the
generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic
regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training
distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several
state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while
pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently
degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization
gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the
practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在不平衡分类任务中常因无法区分决策边界附近的关键实例和数据分布核心的冗余样本而效果受限，需要系统化的数据区分方法。

Method: 采用边界数据过采样方法增强关键样本，同时使用核心感知缩减技术压缩冗余数据，在保持准确率的同时大幅减少数据集规模。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，边界过采样方法在96%的数据集上F1分数提升高达10%，核心缩减方法可将数据集压缩90%同时保持准确性，效率提升10倍。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到文本、多模态和自监督学习场景，为高效模型训练提供新途径，推动数据高效学习的发展，实现更快的收敛和显著的计算节省。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced
classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between
critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples
concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a
method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of
data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show
that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\%
on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses
datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more
powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our
method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in
computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training.
By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be
extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering
a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant
computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in
data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force
expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements. Our code is

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has
offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT
methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the
high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the
generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology
and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian
prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and
expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials
electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the
zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial
charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in
the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output
level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to
the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output
mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with
strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian
prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy
performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing
error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large
condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a
high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC,
comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the
periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results
on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and
efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多重校准方法在工业界应用有限，主要原因是需要手动指定子组、不可扩展性以及可能损害其他模型性能指标。

Method: MCGrad不需要显式指定受保护组，具有可扩展性，并且通常能改善其他机器学习评估指标。

Result: MCGrad已在Meta投入生产，成为数百个生产模型的一部分，并在公共数据集上展示了良好的结果。

Conclusion: MCGrad是一种有效的多重校准方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在实际应用中证明了其价值。

Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm.
Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important
property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing
multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry.
We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be
manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not
scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss
and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require
explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves
other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in
production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We
present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于重症监护时间序列数据集规模有限且可用性不足，该领域的基础模型研究相对较少，需要开发能够在小数据集上有效工作的模型。

Method: 使用双向Transformer架构，在合并的电子健康记录数据集上进行预训练，然后在与训练源不同的数据集上进行微调，用于死亡率预测任务。

Result: 模型在小数据集（<5,000样本）上表现优于监督基线，特别是在死亡率预测任务中显示出有效的迁移学习能力。

Conclusion: 自监督基础模型在重症监护时间序列分析中具有潜力，能够支持资源受限环境下的通用化和稳健临床应用。

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in
recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain
relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets.
In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for
critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on
pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer
learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training
sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines,
particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the
potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series
to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited
settings.

TL;DR: PromptCoT 2.0是一个可扩展的框架，通过期望最大化循环迭代优化提示合成，生成更困难、更多样化的问题，支持自玩和监督微调两种训练方式，在数学和编程推理任务上取得了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量训练问题不足：人工标注数据集成本高且有限，现有合成语料库往往过于简单或狭窄。需要开发能够生成更困难、更多样化问题的可扩展方法。

Method: 基于PromptCoT 1.0，使用期望最大化循环替代手工启发式方法，迭代优化理性推理来指导提示构建。支持自玩训练（强模型通过可验证反馈自主改进）和监督微调（弱模型从教师蒸馏轨迹中学习）。

Result: 在自玩模式下，Qwen3-30B模型在多个基准测试中创下新纪录；在监督微调模式下，仅使用合成提示训练的Qwen2.5-7B模型性能超过使用人类或混合数据训练的模型。分析证实PromptCoT 2.0生成的问题确实更困难且分布不同。

Conclusion: 提示合成成为扩展推理能力的新维度，PromptCoT 2.0为未来开源模型提供了可扩展的基础，证明了合成数据在提升推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into
strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive
programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven
progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:
human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora
are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales
into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we
present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted
heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are
iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that
are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts
support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve
autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled
traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new
state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME
24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on
Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts
boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),
surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm
that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct
problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling
reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future
open-source models. The implementation is available at

Motivation: 研究结构化随机多臂老虎机中的纯探索问题，旨在高效地从有限假设集中识别正确假设。传统渐近分析简化为极大极小优化问题，但结构约束引入了尖锐的病理现象，如非唯一最优解、最优设计在最佳臂上质量为零等。

Method: 提出Frank-Wolfe自博弈方法：将问题重新表述为允许怀疑论者采用混合策略的凹-凸鞍点问题，设计投影自由、正则化自由、调参自由的算法，其单热点更新与老虎机采样范式匹配。通过微分包含论证和Lyapunov分析证明收敛性。

Result: 在线性老虎机的最佳臂识别任务中，证明了游戏值的收敛性。数值实验显示对偶间隙消失，算法能够避开病理非光滑点，实现全局收敛到最优游戏值。

Conclusion: FWSP方法有效解决了结构化老虎机探索中的算法设计挑战，提出的后验采样学习算法在实验中表现出良好的性能，为结构化随机多臂老虎机的纯探索问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits,
aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of
alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a
maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation
between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements
to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We
reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy,
yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to
Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free,
tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit
sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies
that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study
exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm,
bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these
challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the
game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds
through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov
function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and
convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires
differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we
show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from
pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the
optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed
flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we
further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical
experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

Motivation: 现有方法在少样本生成中存在过拟合、模式崩溃以及忽略潜在空间几何结构的问题，需要一种能够保持数据流形几何特性的解决方案。

Method: 使用带有流形保持损失的自动编码器建立稳定的潜在空间，然后通过迭代的生成-校正-增强循环，利用几何校正算子将样本拉向数据流形。

Result: LIRF在AFHQ-Cat数据集上生成了连贯的高分辨率图像，收敛定理证明了生成流形与真实数据流形之间Hausdorff距离的可预测减小。

Conclusion: LIRF为数据稀缺的生成建模提供了一个理论上有基础且实践有效的解决方案，流形保持潜在空间和收缩校正机制是其成功的关键组件。

Abstract: Few-shot generation, the synthesis of high-quality and diverse samples from
limited training data, remains a significant challenge in generative modeling.
Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and
mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting
the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these
limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel
approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of
geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using
an autoencoder trained with our novel \textbf{manifold-preservation loss}
$L_{\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the
geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we
propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle,
candidate samples are refined by a geometric \textbf{correction operator}, a
provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while
preserving diversity. We also provide the \textbf{Convergence Theorem}
demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated
and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by
generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies
confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive
correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF
provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only
theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.

Motivation: 贡献评估是确保公平性和激励参与的关键机制，但现有研究对其脆弱性关注不足。本文旨在揭示贡献分数在不同聚合方法和恶意攻击下的不稳定性。

Method: 通过在不同数据集和模型架构上进行广泛实验，使用Flower框架，系统分析了不同模型聚合方法对贡献分数的影响，并研究了投毒攻击对贡献评估的破坏效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，聚合方法的选择和攻击者的存在都是扭曲贡献分数的有效向量，先进聚合技术可能无意中显著改变最终分数，恶意参与者能够策略性地操纵模型更新来夸大自身贡献。

Conclusion: 当前贡献评估方案存在严重脆弱性，迫切需要开发更鲁棒的评估机制来应对架构差异和恶意攻击带来的挑战。

Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated
learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing
participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant
distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and
intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation
methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging
approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to
handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly
alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning
attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model
updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of
other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously
show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers
are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical
need for more robust evaluation schemes.

Motivation: 探索强化学习中的稀疏奖励环境具有挑战性，基础模型具有强大的语义先验，但其在经典RL基准测试中作为零样本探索代理的能力尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 在赌博机、Gridworlds和稀疏奖励Atari游戏中测试LLMs和VLMs的零样本探索能力，并研究一个简单的在线混合框架来分析如何弥合"知行之差"。

Result: VLMs能够从视觉输入推断高级目标，但在精确低级控制方面持续失败。在理想化设置中，VLM指导可以显著提高早期样本效率。

Conclusion: 基础模型更适合用于指导探索而非端到端控制，这为使用基础模型改善RL探索提供了明确的分析和约束条件。

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly
in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic
priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL
benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed
bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our
investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level
objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level
control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap,
we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case
scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can
significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis
of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide
exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

Motivation: 利用大型语言模型的提示方法作为无需训练的方法来检测阿尔茨海默病，研究零样本和少样本提示的效果，并提高结果的可解释性。

Method: 使用ADReSS数据集，研究零样本提示和少样本提示（每类最多20个示例）。提出两种变体：MMSE-代理提示（将少样本示例与MMSE评分概率锚定）和推理增强提示（使用多模态LLM生成推理内容）。

Abstract: Prompting large language models is a training-free method for detecting
Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts. Using the ADReSS dataset, we
revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced
protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20
examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art
prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a
probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic
mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii)
Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a
multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript,

TL;DR: TABFAIRGDT是一种使用自回归决策树生成公平合成表格数据的新方法，通过软叶重采样技术减少偏见，在保持预测性能的同时实现更好的公平性-效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保机器学习公平性是一个重要挑战，现有方法多依赖深度架构，但简单模型在处理表格数据时可能更有效。

Method: 提出TABFAIRGDT方法，使用自回归决策树生成合成数据，并采用软叶重采样技术调整决策树输出来减少偏见。该方法是非参数的，能有效处理混合特征类型。

Result: 在基准公平性数据集上评估显示，TABFAIRGDT优于最先进的深度生成模型，实现了更好的公平性-效用权衡和更高的合成数据质量，平均速度提升72%。

Conclusion: TABFAIRGDT是一种轻量级、高效且CPU兼容的方法，无需数据预处理，能在标准CPU上快速生成公平合成数据，适合实际公平敏感应用。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as
models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have
recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level
while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite
evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this
work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic
tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we
propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to
reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is
non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed
feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data
distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models,
achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as
higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly
efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably,
TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across
various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized
datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU,
making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

*Mohammad Tabish,Benedict Leimkuhler,Stefan Klus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RaNNDy的随机神经网络方法，用于从数据中学习转移算子及其谱分解。该方法通过随机选择隐藏层权重、仅训练输出层，显著减少训练时间和资源消耗，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法存在训练时间长、资源消耗大、对超参数敏感以及收敛慢等问题。需要一种更高效的方法来学习转移算子的谱分解，用于分析复杂动力系统行为。

Method: 使用随机神经网络，隐藏层权重随机选择，仅训练输出层。通过闭式解计算输出层，直接表示算子的特征函数。利用集成学习估计谱特性的不确定性。

Result: 该方法在不同动力系统算子（包括Koopman、Perron-Frobenius算子和薛定谔算子）上进行了测试，应用于随机动力系统、蛋白质折叠过程和量子谐振子等场景。结果显示在保持精度的同时显著提高了训练效率。

Conclusion: RaNNDy框架提供了一种高效学习转移算子谱分解的方法，减少了训练负担并避免了深度学习的常见问题，但文中也指出了该方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning
transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of
the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the
output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable
reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time
and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such
as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the
proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output
layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover,
it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral
properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical
operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have
important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems,
and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the
strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several
stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum
harmonic oscillator.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出可学习采样器蒸馏（LSD）方法，通过蒸馏技术让少步数的学生采样器学习多步数教师采样器的分数轨迹，从而加速离散扩散模型的采样过程，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型（DDMs）在文本和分子等离散数据生成方面表现出色，但采样效率低下，需要大量采样步骤。使用大步长加速采样会导致生成质量显著下降，因为放大了因子化预测的复合解码误差和数值近似的离散化误差。

Method: 提出LSD方法，通过蒸馏技术训练学生采样器，使其用较少步骤就能对齐教师采样器的中间分数轨迹。使用可学习采样器系数自适应调整采样动态。进一步提出LSD+，学习非均匀分配步骤的时间调度。

Result: 在文本生成、图像生成和合成任务上的实验表明，LSD方法在显著减少采样步数的同时，实现了比现有采样器更高的采样质量。

Conclusion: LSD和LSD+方法有效解决了DDMs采样效率低下的问题，通过蒸馏学习和自适应采样策略，在保持高质量生成的同时大幅加速采样过程。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for
discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical
application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of
sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically
introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the
impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and
discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant
decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable
sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity
samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler
with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of
a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved
by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling
dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time
schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text
generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed
approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially
higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的概率时间序列预测模型依赖采样来表示未来不确定性，但这种方法存在固有局限性，如缺乏显式概率、覆盖不足和计算成本高。

Method: 提出了TimePrism模型，仅由三个并行线性层组成，通过直接生成有限数量的{场景,概率}对来避免蒙特卡洛近似。

Result: TimePrism在五个基准数据集的两个指标上取得了10个结果中的9个最先进水平。

Conclusion: 概率场景范式通过重新定义学习目标，从建模整个连续概率空间转向学习表示一组合理场景及其对应概率，展示了超越采样的预测研究潜力。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on
sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from
inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate
coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address
the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of
\{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation.
To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model
composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves
9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two
metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing
of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability
space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and
corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the
Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in
forecasting beyond sampling.

*Abdulla Jasem Almansoori,Maria Ivanova,Andrey Veprikov,Aleksandr Beznosikov,Samuel Horváth,Martin Takáč*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPLoRA是一种内存高效的优化器，通过将LoRA优化转化为可解释的子问题，并使用交替最小二乘法更新来缩小LoRA微调与完整训练之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA微调虽然大幅减少了可训练参数和内存使用，但与完整训练（SVDLoRA）仍存在性能差距，表明LoRA步骤还有改进空间。

Method: 将LoRA优化转化为可解释的子问题，使用交替最小二乘法进行高效更新，1-2次交替步骤即可接近截断SVD的性能，无需形成完整矩阵。支持动量机制，内存预算仅为LoRA参数的3倍。

Result: 在线性任务、MNIST、CIFAR-100和RoBERTa-base（MNLI）上，OPLoRA始终接近SVDLoRA的性能，同时使用显著更少的内存。

Conclusion: OPLoRA成功缩小了LoRA微调与完整训练之间的性能差距，提供了一种内存高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank
updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters
and memory. However, there is still a gap between full training with low-rank
projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA steps can be
further improved. In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient
optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable
sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates,
where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely
match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the
recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA
supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine
(LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of
LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled
variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear
task, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches
SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI医疗研究主要依赖模型参数中隐式编码的知识，忽视了不同下游任务需要的特定知识，无法满足临床诊断对严格指南的要求

Method: RAD框架包含三个关键机制：从多医学源检索和精炼疾病知识、指南增强的对比损失约束多模态特征与指南知识的潜在距离、双Transformer解码器使用指南作为查询来引导跨模态融合

Result: 在四个不同解剖结构数据集上的广泛评估显示RAD具有良好泛化能力，达到最先进性能，并能更精确关注异常区域和关键指标

Conclusion: RAD框架通过显式知识注入使模型更符合临床诊断工作流程，实现了基于证据的可信诊断，并为多模态诊断模型的可解释性评估提供了量化标准

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain
expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven
medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text
pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches
primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters,
neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a
novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal
models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three
key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from
multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains
the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and
the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer
cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from
guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover,
recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for
multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the
interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations
across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's
generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD
enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and
critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis. Our code
is available at https://github.com/tdlhl/RAD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pi-Transformer是一种基于物理先验的Transformer模型，通过双注意力路径（数据驱动序列注意力和平滑演化的先验注意力）来检测多元时间序列中的异常，特别擅长识别时序和相位异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列中的异常通常源于时间上下文和跨通道协调，而非孤立离群点。现有方法缺乏对时间不变性（如尺度自相似性和相位同步性）的编码。

Method: 使用双注意力路径：数据驱动序列注意力和编码时间不变性的先验注意力。训练时结合重构目标和鼓励两个注意力一致性的发散项，先验被正则化以平滑演化。推理时结合对齐加权重构信号和时序相位失配信号进行检测。

Result: 在五个基准数据集（SMD、MSL、SMAP、SWaT和PSM）上达到最先进或极具竞争力的F1分数，特别在时序和相位异常检测方面表现优异。案例分析显示两个流具有互补行为。

Conclusion: 将物理先验嵌入注意力机制为复杂多元系统中的异常检测提供了一种校准且鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and
cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present
Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a
data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that
encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase
synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction
error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence
term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them
meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is
lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model
combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch
signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a
single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and
PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with
particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show
complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around
regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a
calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate
systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub
repository\footnote{https://github.com/sepehr-m/Pi-Transformer}.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渗透测试作为模拟网络攻击来识别安全漏洞的序列决策问题，适合强化学习自动化。但现实世界中的部分可观测性挑战了传统MDP的马尔可夫性质，需要开发更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 使用PPO作为基线，比较多种PPO变体来缓解部分可观测性，包括帧堆叠、历史信息增强观测、循环神经网络和Transformer架构，在不同规模的网络环境中进行系统实证分析。

Result: 研究发现历史信息聚合方法效果显著，收敛速度比其他方法快三倍。对学习策略的手动检查揭示了超越定量结果的清晰差异和深入见解。

Conclusion: 历史聚合方法能有效应对渗透测试中的部分可观测性挑战，开发出更鲁棒和可迁移的策略，为现实世界复杂环境提供可靠性能保障。

Abstract: Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security
vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for
reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to
real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it
invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state
estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially
observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size,
aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and
representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more
robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable
performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using
vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a
selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including
frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and
employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We
find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three
times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies
by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go
beyond quantitative results.

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个新的表示学习范式，利用扩散过程本身驱动对比目标，创建具有强类别可分性的噪声不变嵌入。

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the
challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can
fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within
this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented
Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and
supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space
created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel
Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward
process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy
views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a
supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class
discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We
evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset,
achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm
for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the
contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a
strong foundation for class separability.

Conclusion: LLM-Filter展示了作为滤波基础模型的潜力，通过利用LLM的推理能力为状态估计问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal
filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and
engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework,
\textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state
estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various
experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state
estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in
pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM,
LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second,
we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating
task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks.
Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization,
capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen
environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where
accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These
findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.

TL;DR: 提出Yomo方法，通过概率聚合机制和锐化预测损失函数，实现量子机器学习模型的单次测量推理，大幅降低测量成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子机器学习模型依赖大量重复测量来获得可靠预测，导致高昂的推理成本和时间开销，限制了QML的实际应用。

Method: 用概率聚合机制替代Pauli期望值输出，引入鼓励锐化预测的损失函数，实现单次测量即可获得准确推理结果。

Result: 理论分析表明Yomo避免了基于期望值模型的测量缩放限制，在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验证实Yomo在不同测量预算和退极化信道模拟下均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Yomo通过实现准确的单次测量推理，显著降低了QML部署的财务和计算成本，为QML的实际应用降低了门槛。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated
measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This
dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time
overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is
typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose
You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves
accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the
single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a
probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage
sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the
shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms
baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing
channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially
reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby
lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Abstract: Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine
learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently
incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing
data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based
framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To
this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed
context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting
strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing
query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate
imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete
data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating
that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic
convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity
conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks,
including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance
in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and
imputing partially observed dynamics.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in
datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge
discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making.
However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational
overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective
search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks.
Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address
the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the
data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced
performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in
high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales
one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and
neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce
the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene
expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50
samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular
foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve
rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: We study \emph{online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes} (CMDPs)
under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. We provide a novel algorithm
whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art
best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the
stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but
unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$
regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby
handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we
provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint
violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early
episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime,
\emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our
algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition,
and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained}
optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation
factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing
the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the
semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an
ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the
mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood.
In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution.
We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic
relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks
using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical
analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures
significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our
analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture
on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability
signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly
in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers
the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding
structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between
embedding organization and semantic patterns.

Result: 实证研究表明，标准监督训练模型的损失梯度与数据流形存在较大角度偏差，而促进梯度-流形对齐能显著提高模型对反演攻击的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 模型对反演攻击的脆弱性取决于损失梯度与生成器流形的对齐程度，通过促进这种对齐可以增强反演攻击效果。

Abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative
samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative
adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process,
yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the
private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we
begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic
inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis
reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by
projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out
off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with
the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with
standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations
from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant
directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become
more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the
generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training
objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we
further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold
alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art generative MIAs.

Conclusion: StrAD通过结构感知的优化目标机制，有效提升了重构基异常检测方法对复杂模式异常的检测能力，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial
applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and
the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches
have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection
remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of
reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures,
ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus
failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose
StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the
optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the
time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture
such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape
in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent
structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time
series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can
assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in
terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation
and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any
reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both
point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that
StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models
across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

Motivation: 当前联邦学习框架在车联网应用中缺乏对客户端选择公平性的考虑，特别是在动态异构环境下，需要确保所有客户端都有公平参与训练的机会。

Method: 提出FairEquityFL框架，包含采样均衡器模块确保客户端选择公平性，以及异常检测机制识别恶意客户端。选择器负责监控和控制客户端参与。

Result: 在FEMNIST数据集上的仿真结果表明，FairEquityFL在性能上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: FairEquityFL框架有效解决了联邦学习在车联网环境中的客户端选择公平性问题，为动态异构环境下的联邦学习应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of
applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy
preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead.
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can
be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the
clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent
to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of
researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL
frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed
fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV
environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework
to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL
training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module
within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair
collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.
The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling
the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier
detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the
model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or
loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily
suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further
evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset,
FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline
models to a considerable extent.

Motivation: 大语言模型权重分布存在重尾异常值，传统量化方法效果不佳。旋转方法将权重转换为近高斯分布，但需要精细的分数位量化器来接近高斯失真率边界。

Conclusion: 分数位量化器对于大语言模型权重量化至关重要，Q-Palette为边缘设备上的个性化推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the
weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no
calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint
and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference
scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its
importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs
complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that
transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with
fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first
derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized
weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit
quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to
achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical
insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile
collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded
quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar
quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with
optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging
Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme
quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion
decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种几何感知的输入噪声方法，通过在数据流形上添加结构化的噪声来改进模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在输入空间添加环境噪声时没有考虑数据的底层流形结构，这限制了噪声正则化的效果。

Method: 提出了两种几何感知噪声方法：1）将环境高斯噪声投影到流形切空间，然后通过测地线映射到流形上；2）在流形上进行布朗运动噪声。

Result: 在高度弯曲的流形上，几何感知噪声显著提高了泛化能力和超参数选择的鲁棒性，在简单流形上至少与无噪声训练相当。

Conclusion: 几何感知噪声框架能够有效利用数据流形结构，提升深度学习模型的性能，并可扩展到学习的数据流形。

Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly
regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and
enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the
addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the
underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of
adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional
manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian
noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise
sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also
consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold.
We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and
robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while
performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our
proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP作为最流行的可解释性技术之一，常常忽略了问题的因果结构。do-SHAP虽然采用了干预查询，但其对估计量的依赖限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用估计量无关的方法，允许从单一模型估计任何可识别的查询；开发了加速计算的新算法；提出了解释不可访问数据生成过程的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在获得可靠解释方面具有潜力，解决了do-SHAP在复杂图上的可行性问题。

Abstract: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular,
but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP
employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its
practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of
estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any
identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex
graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its
computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible
Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational
performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets,
highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遗忘方法在损失景观中驱动模型参数朝向尖锐的最小值，这些不稳定区域使得即使微小参数扰动也能大幅改变模型行为，导致再学习攻击可利用少量样本快速恢复被遗忘知识。

Method: 提出StableUN双层反馈引导优化框架，通过邻域感知优化寻找更稳定的参数区域。集成遗忘反馈（使用对抗扰动探测参数邻域）和记忆反馈（保持模型效用），通过梯度投影对齐两个目标。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE基准测试中，该方法对再学习和越狱攻击表现出显著更强的鲁棒性，同时保持竞争力的效用性能。

Conclusion: StableUN框架有效解决了传统遗忘方法的安全漏洞，实现了更稳健的知识移除，在保持模型效用的同时显著提高了对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that
undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove
sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains
precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root
cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual
data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss
landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can
drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks
exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate
the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly
recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical
robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To
address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided
optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via
neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses
adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering
feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through
gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that
our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and
jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

Conclusion: T-HénonNets成功扩展了HénonNets的能力，能够处理自适应时间步长和非自治系统，为不规则采样数据的辛积分器学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly, i.e., not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [1] and
H\'enonNets [2] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called
TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar
extension for H\'enonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture
called T-H\'enonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive
time steps. We also extend the T-H\'enonNet architecture to non-autonomous
Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems
for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it
is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed
methods. To investigate these theoretical approximation capabilities, we
perform different numerical experiments.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在动态现实环境中部署时，由于传感器漂移或光照变化导致输入数据分布变化，单一静态模型往往不够，需要持续模型自适应。

Method: 首先使用反向传播离线训练深度神经网络获得高性能，然后使用预测编码进行在线自适应，利用反向传播的鲁棒性进行初始表征学习，利用预测编码的计算效率进行持续学习。

Conclusion: 该方法为在动态环境中维持模型性能提供了一个有前景的解决方案，特别适合资源受限的边缘设备或未来神经形态加速器。

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world
environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes
in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations
necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by
combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method
begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to
achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed
for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to
shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness
of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational
efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly
well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic
accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a
reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining
model performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and
the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is
essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing
limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose
HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which
integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression
features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the
sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM
architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies
of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer
(MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics
of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev
Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and
interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating
virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction,
HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel
heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets
demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies
further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong
transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA
functional classification. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health,
underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen
novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates
in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high
bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,
computational models specifically designed to predict associations between
oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a
prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover
potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,
microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic
information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a
prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful
paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global
features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a
benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and
hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies
further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to
uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer
valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug
development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM评判基准存在的问题，提出了两种诊断机制来量化基准排名中的噪声和不确定性，发现在Arena-Hard Auto基准中存在严重的模式不一致性和因子崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM评判基准被广泛用于评估复杂模型行为，其设计引入了传统基于真实标签的基准中不存在的故障模式。作者认为如果没有严格的目标和可验证的构建，基准排名可能会产生实际上是噪声的高置信度排名。

Method: 提出了两种诊断机制：1）模式一致性量化评判者整体裁决中由显式评估模式解释的比例；2）心理测量有效性通过聚合内部一致性和区分效度信号来量化基准运行中的不可约不确定性。

Result: 在Arena-Hard Auto基准上应用这些工具发现：DeepSeek-R1-32B的未解释方差超过90%，大多数标准的因子相关性高于0.93，ELO风格聚合会掩盖真实的排名不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了破坏有效性的设计失败，并为构建更好范围、可靠性感知的LLM评判基准提供了可操作的原则。

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model
behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional
ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and
verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence
rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to
diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's
overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing
unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric
validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to
quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools
to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse
across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent
for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We
also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and
masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that
undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped,
reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自下而上的方法来估算大规模LLM系统每次查询的能耗，发现前沿模型（>2000亿参数）的中位能耗为0.34 Wh，而非生产环境的估算可能高估4-20倍。通过模型、服务平台和硬件层面的优化，能耗可降低8-20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI推理规模达到数十亿查询，以及新兴推理和代理工作流增加token需求，可靠的每次查询能耗估算对于容量规划、排放核算和效率优先级越来越重要。许多公开估算不一致且高估能耗，因为它们基于有限基准进行外推，未能反映规模化可实现的效率增益。

Method: 引入基于token吞吐量的自下而上方法，估算大规模LLM系统的每次查询能耗。考虑H100节点在现实工作负载、GPU利用率和PUE约束下的运行情况。

Result: 前沿模型（>2000亿参数）的中位能耗为0.34 Wh（IQR: 0.18-0.67）。测试时扩展场景（每个典型查询token增加15倍）中位能耗上升13倍至4.32 Wh。通过针对性效率干预，能耗可降低8-20倍。

Conclusion: 在长查询场景中针对性提高效率将带来最大的全舰队范围节能效果。数据中心历史上通过效率增益缓解能源增长的模式在LLM部署中同样适用，通过优化可将能耗控制在类似规模网络搜索的水平。

Abstract: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and
agentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy
use are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and
efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate
energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to
reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce
a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM
systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under
realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median
energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200
billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using
production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and
assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling
scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x
to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver
the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the
model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median
reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can
plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we
estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion
queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8
GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,
similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how
data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains
during the internet and cloud build-up.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商金融领域的预测面临发票时间不规律、付款延迟、用户行为差异等挑战，传统时间序列方法效果有限，深度学习模型在数据稀疏和历史窗口短的情况下性能下降。

Method: 集成动态滞后特征工程和自适应滚动窗口表示，结合经典统计模型和集成学习器，包含发票级行为建模、结构化滞后支持数据和自定义稳定性感知损失函数。

Result: 实验结果显示MAPE相比基线模型降低约5%，带来显著财务节省，提高了季度预测稳定性，并增强了特征与目标的相关性。

Conclusion: 结合结构化滞后、发票级闭合建模和行为洞察，能有效提升稀疏金融时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly
challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and
user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse
datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional
time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have
shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial
observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we
propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature
engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical
statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates
invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom
stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and
irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5%
reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial
financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over
quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both
short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and
simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of
combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral
insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series
forecasting.

Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning
tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these
reasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the
basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer
framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two
core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization,
which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We
further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph
density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework
for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.

Motivation: 研究SimPO在离线偏好优化中的优异表现是否能在在线RLHF设置中通过最大熵RL实现，探索参考自由方法在不同设置下的适用性。

Method: 通过实验比较最大熵RL和KL约束方法在在线RLHF设置中的表现，分析训练稳定性和优化行为。

Result: 最大熵RL在在线设置中表现出持续的过优化和不稳定KL动态，即使学习率很低也无法避免奖励黑客问题。

Conclusion: 参考自由方法在在线和离线偏好学习中面临不同的挑战，SimPO在离线设置中成功而最大熵RL在在线设置中表现不佳。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be
derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized
temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method.
Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we
investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online
RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently
exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning
rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy
regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with
overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO
succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online
scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face
distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了扩展低秩近似（xLRA）框架，通过张量分解高效预测多孔材料微观结构到局部弹性响应的映射，仅需少量数据即可实现高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测微观结构如何控制异质材料的力学响应对于优化设计和性能至关重要，但由于微观结构特征的高维复杂性，传统物理模拟计算成本过高，需要开发高效的数据驱动方法。

Method: 采用规范多adic张量分解，通过自适应引入更高秩项，将高维微观结构信息高效映射到局部弹性响应。

Result: xLRA仅需最大秩为4即可准确预测多孔微观结构中的局部弹性应变场，仅使用5%数据集训练即可实现准确预测，计算效率比现有方法高6个数量级。

Conclusion: xLRA提供了一个高效框架，能够从微观结构预测弹性响应，实现结构-性能关系的可扩展映射，在预测精度、泛化性和计算效率方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of
heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet
this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of
microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the
microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the
development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property
linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven
approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To
address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation
(xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It
efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local
elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately
predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a
maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate
predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant
data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results
across representative material systems, including two phase composites and
single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains
essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen
microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods
in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while
requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary,
xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from
microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了有效跨度维度（ESD）这一新的复杂度度量，用于分析数据驱动核学习场景下的谱算法泛化性能，证明了ESD与最小化超额风险的关系，并建立了自适应特征学习与泛化改进的理论联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定核理论无法充分解释数据驱动核学习场景下的泛化性能，需要一个新的复杂度度量框架来联合考虑信号、谱和噪声水平的影响。

Method: 引入有效跨度维度（ESD）作为对齐敏感的复杂度度量，分析序列模型的ESD与最小化超额风险的关系，研究过参数化梯度流对ESD的优化作用。

Result: 证明了当ESD不超过K时，最小化超额风险按σ²K缩放；梯度流能够降低ESD，从而改善泛化性能。

Conclusion: ESD框架为超越传统固定核理论的泛化分析提供了新视角，在核学习和线性模型等场景中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from
data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive
complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise
level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals
without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that
for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as
$\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and
prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between
adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of
spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by
extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory
with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on
generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了图变量神经网络（GVNNs），这是一种能够处理动态演化时空信号的新型图神经网络框架，通过结合稳定的长期支持和瞬时数据驱动交互来捕捉动态统计依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络假设存在固定的底层图结构，但实际应用中这种结构可能不存在或需要从信号中独立推导。动态演化的时空信号建模是GNN领域的一个重要挑战。

Method: 基于图变量信号分析（GVSA）框架，构建包含瞬时连接性配置文件的网络张量，结合稳定的长期支持和数据驱动的瞬时交互，实现对时空信号的卷积操作，具有线性序列长度复杂度。

Result: 在预测基准测试中，GVNNs持续优于基于图的基线方法，并与LSTM和Transformer等广泛使用的序列模型竞争。在EEG运动想象分类任务中达到高精度，展示了在脑机接口应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: GVNNs提供了一种有效处理动态时空信号的方法，能够捕捉动态统计依赖关系，在多个应用场景中表现出优越性能，为图神经网络在动态系统建模中的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent
challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an
existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not
always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving
functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph
Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a
network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support
usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from
graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs):
layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent
connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous,
data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical
interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits
an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across
forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based
baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs
and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong
accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface
applications.

Motivation: 研究稀疏网络权重的结构特性，解决神经网络权重恢复中的内存效率问题，为稀疏神经网络提供理论保证。

Method: 使用迭代硬阈值算法（iterative hard thresholding algorithm）来恢复两层标量输出网络的稀疏权重，内存使用随非零权重数量线性增长。

Result: 理论结果在稀疏种植MLPs恢复、MNIST分类和隐式神经表示等实验中得到验证，性能与基于迭代幅度剪枝的高性能基线相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持竞争力的同时显著提高了内存效率，为稀疏神经网络的实用化提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks,
where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered.
Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for
two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard
thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows
linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result
with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST
classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find
performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but
memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度网络泛化能力的原因，通过分析内部特征的时间演化，发现了一种时间一致性现象：早期检查点的浅层特征与后期深层特征结合时预测保持稳定，这种稳定性作为一种隐式结构化增强支持泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统泛化理论无法充分解释深度网络的泛化能力，因此需要从内部特征演化的角度来研究这一基本问题。

Method: 通过分析深度网络训练过程中不同时间点的特征组合，研究预测的稳定性，并测试在未见数据、损坏数据以及语义结构被破坏情况下的表现。

Result: 发现时间一致性现象在未见和损坏数据上依然存在，但在语义结构被破坏时崩溃。统计测试显示SGD注入的各向异性噪声与少数主方向对齐，增强了结构化变异性。

Conclusion: 研究提出了将特征动态与泛化联系起来的概念视角，为未来测量时间特征演化的实用替代方法指明了方向。

Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization
theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and
outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a
phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow
features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones.
This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of
implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that
temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when
semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests
further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal
directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability.
Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature
dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates
for measuring temporal feature evolution.

Motivation: 传统基于XGBoost的ATO检测系统独立评分会话，忽略了协调攻击和"欺诈环"的关系和时空结构特征

Method: 构建时间尊重有向会话图，通过共享标识符连接实体，使用时窗和时效性约束调节连通性，采用GraphSAGE变体进行归纳学习

Result: 在Capital One高风险数字产品上，AUC提升6.38%，客户摩擦减少50%以上

Conclusion: ATLAS框架通过图神经网络有效捕捉ATO欺诈的时空关系特征，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升检测效果

Abstract: Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer
banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction
for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular
gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions
independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online
activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce
ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a
framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node
classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links
entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates
connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal,
time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses
only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We
operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor
sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B
edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38
percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer
friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.

Result: PIF模型在准确性、物理合理性和噪声鲁棒性方面均优于纯数据驱动模型，并在迁移学习场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为制药制造关键应用开发可靠且可泛化的预测解决方案提供了路线图。

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone
of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel
at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to
physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in
regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models
for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range
of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning
architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three
different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed
trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a
Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for
accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise.
Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a
transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models
outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical
plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing
reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in
the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

Abstract: Progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) faces significant
bottlenecks, particularly in rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems
and acquiring the vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents.
This paper posits that user simulation -- creating computational agents that
mimic human interaction with AI systems -- is not merely a useful tool, but is
a critical catalyst required to overcome these bottlenecks and accelerate AGI
development. We argue that realistic simulators provide the necessary
environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning,
and fostering the adaptive capabilities central to AGI. Therefore, research
into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply
synergistic and must advance hand-in-hand. This article elaborates on the
critical role of user simulation for AGI, explores the interdisciplinary nature
of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges including those
posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda.

TL;DR: 本文提出评估感知强化学习（EvA-RL），这是一种新的RL范式，在训练策略时同时考虑评估准确性，使策略既高效又易于评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统策略评估方法存在高方差（数据有限、长时任务）或高偏差（支持不均、环境模型不准确）问题，这些问题源于标准RL范式在训练时未考虑评估需求

Method: 设计EvA-RL框架，训练策略同时最大化期望回报和最小化评估误差；扩展方法共同学习基于评估条件的状态值预测器

Result: 在离散和连续动作领域的实验表明，EvA-RL能显著降低评估误差，同时保持有竞争力的回报性能

Conclusion: EvA-RL为RL方法开辟了新方向，将可靠评估作为训练过程中的首要原则

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and
performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer
from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due
to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these
challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)
paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an
alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in
which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously
minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --
in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL
and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,
conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can
be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis
and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation
accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme
within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an
assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical
results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that
EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive
returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that
treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个将AI评估作为推理的框架，强调基准测试分数应是基于能力理论的推断而非简单测量，并针对敏感性挑战提出了解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型在基准数据上的评估普遍存在可靠性问题，基准分数被错误地视为简单测量而非推断，需要建立更可靠的能力评估方法。

Method: 提出了评估作为推理的原则性框架：从能力理论出发，推导出估计方法；针对敏感性挑战，引入了考虑不确定性的能力推断方法，包括显著降低样本复杂度的自适应算法。

Result: 该框架为通过基准测试获得更可靠和可信的AI能力估计奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 评估应被视为基于能力理论的推断过程，这一视角有助于提高AI能力评估的可靠性和可信度。

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and
their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's
capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we
know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance?
Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are
inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to
assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make
this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as
inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for
estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has
not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address
a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations.
After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability
while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including
an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together,
these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy
estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文分析了在固定计算预算下，LLM自一致性估计器及其权衡，提出了m和n与√B成比例的分配策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统经常重复相同的提示给大语言模型并聚合响应以提高可靠性，需要分析在固定计算预算下的最优分配策略。

Method: 分析自一致性估计器，在固定计算预算B=mn的约束下，研究m（提示采样数）和n（每个提示的重复调用数）之间的权衡关系。

Result: 分析结果表明，m和n应该与√B成比例分配，即m,n∝√B。

Conclusion: 在固定计算预算下，为了优化LLM的可靠性评估，提示采样数和重复调用数应该大致按照平方根比例进行分配。

Abstract: Systems often repeat the same prompt to large language models (LLMs) and
aggregate responses to improve reliability. This short note analyzes an
estimator of the self-consistency of LLMs and the tradeoffs it induces under a
fixed compute budget $B=mn$, where $m$ is the number of prompts sampled from
the task distribution and $n$ is the number of repeated LLM calls per prompt;
the resulting analysis favors a rough split $m,n\propto\sqrt{B}$.

*Sai Teja Reddy Adapala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了计算认知负荷理论，通过ICE基准测试发现大语言模型在认知负荷下推理性能显著下降，认知负荷是导致推理失败的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在静态基准测试中表现出色，但在动态、信息丰富的环境中表现脆弱，其认知负荷下的计算限制机制尚不明确。

Method: 引入计算认知负荷理论，设计ICE基准系统操纵上下文饱和和注意力残留两个负荷因素，对5个指令调优模型进行综合评估。

Result: 小规模开源模型在所有条件下准确率为0%，Gemini-2.0-Flash-001在控制条件下准确率达85%，但在上下文饱和下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 认知负荷是推理失败的关键因素，动态的认知感知压力测试对于评估AI系统的真实韧性和安全性至关重要。

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap
between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,
information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the
computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain
poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational
cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context
Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key
mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive
Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these
load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N
= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant
performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller
open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all
conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In
contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%
accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation
under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These
findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor
to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under
uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as
exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true
resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出StepEval评估框架，使用视觉语言模型自动判断多步骤机器人操作任务的子目标完成情况，实现更细粒度的性能评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人学习研究仅报告单一二进制成功率，无法显示多步骤操作任务中各子目标的完成情况，需要更细粒度的评估方法

Method: 设计StepEval框架，利用视觉语言模型作为自动评判器，从记录图像或视频中评估子目标结果，支持单视图或多视图输入

Result: 提出可扩展的社区驱动开源项目蓝图，主要评估指标为每个子目标的成功率向量，同时考虑延迟和成本等诊断指标

Conclusion: StepEval框架旨在建立标准化、可复现的评估实践，使评估子目标而不仅仅是最终目标成为机器人学习领域的常规做法

Abstract: Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR),
which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation
task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each
trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible
(e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware
plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as
automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather
than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design
principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval,
the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector;
however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered
for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation
efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available.
We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or
multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended
contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites
open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal,
becomes a standard and reproducible practice.

Method: 开发了Nano Bio-Agent（NBA）框架，整合任务分解、工具编排和API访问（如NCBI和AlphaGenome系统），将小型语言模型与专业工具相结合。

Result: 小型模型（3-100亿参数）在GeneTuring基准测试中达到85-97%的准确率，最佳模型-智能体组合达到98%准确率，性能优于使用更大模型的现有方法。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型结合智能体框架在基因组学问答中表现出色，具有效率提升、成本节约和工具民主化的潜力，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: We investigate the application of Small Language Models (<10 billion
parameters) for genomics question answering via agentic framework to address
hallucination issues and computational cost challenges. The Nano Bio-Agent
(NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool
orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and
AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can
achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing
approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination
achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B
parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much
lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates
promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of
ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法孤立处理复杂Text-to-SQL查询中的数学推理和模式导航挑战，导致推理过程碎片化，影响逻辑和结构正确性。

Method: SteinerSQL采用三阶段方法：数学分解识别所需表格（终端节点），通过Steiner树问题构建最优推理支架，以及多级验证确保正确性。

Result: 在LogicCat和Spider2.0-Lite基准测试中，使用Gemini-2.5-Pro分别达到36.10%和40.04%的执行准确率，创下新纪录。

Conclusion: SteinerSQL为Text-to-SQL提供了新的统一范式，为复杂推理任务开辟了更稳健和原则性的解决方案路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that
demand both sophisticated mathematical reasoning and intricate schema
navigation. Existing methods often tackle these challenges in isolation,
creating a fractured reasoning process that compromises logical and structural
correctness. To resolve this, we introduce SteinerSQL, a framework that unifies
these dual challenges into a single, graph-centric optimization problem.
SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify
required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a
Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the
challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a
new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively,
using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Beyond accuracy, SteinerSQL presents a new, unified
paradigm for Text-to-SQL, paving the way for more robust and principled
solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有推理模型的自评估能力较差，限制了测试时计算策略的有效性，需要更好的验证机制来识别错误模式。

Method: 使用强化学习（GRPO）训练成对解释验证器，生成校准的置信度分数和相关的自然语言推理。

We propose a pairwise Explanatory Verifier, trained via reinforcement learning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在训练智能体模型方面有潜力，但智能体的最终价值在于辅助用户的能力，而用户交互的多样性和动态性带来了挑战

Method: 提出UserRL统一框架，使用标准化gym环境和模拟用户，系统研究不同奖励分配和轨迹评分对GRPO算法学习的影响，在Qwen3模型上进行实验

Result: 三个关键发现：SFT冷启动对初始交互能力和持续RL改进至关重要；精心设计的轨迹评分能产生更高效的多轮交互；虽然GPT-4o等强模拟用户有助于训练，但开源模拟器是成本效益高的选择

Conclusion: 奖励塑造和用户模拟选择的设计与模型规模同等重要，UserRL为开发稳健的用户中心智能体模型提供了实用途径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that
move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.
Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a
setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In
this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating
user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with
simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and
trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect
learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal
three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial
interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate
trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;
and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,
open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and
transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of
reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and
establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric
agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

Motivation: 现代LLM推理依赖于大量的测试时计算，但模型冗余和指令遵循能力差导致计算效率低下。作者旨在解决这种能力-成本权衡问题。

Method: 引入cepo优化推理工作流程，通过协同设计编排框架与底层模型能力，减少冗余计算并提升指令遵循效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为中小型模型解锁强大推理能力提供了清晰路径，并将开源该工作流程以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Modern LLM reasoning relies on extensive test-time computation, driven by
internal model training and external agentic orchestration. However, this
synergy is often inefficient, as model verbosity and poor instruction following
lead to wasted compute. We analyze this capability-cost trade-off and introduce
an optimized reasoning workflow (\cepo) that empowers smaller open-source
models to outperform models multiple times their size. We will open-source this
workflow to enable further research. Our work demonstrates a clear path toward
co-designing orchestration frameworks with the underlying model capabilities to
unlock powerful reasoning in small-to-medium sized models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主代理在低代码/无代码环境中的非确定性特性导致可靠性问题，如陷入循环、产生错误输出或遇到不可恢复的故障，这会降低用户体验和信任度。

Method: 设计了一个次级"元认知"层来监控主代理，基于延迟过长或重复动作等触发条件预测任务失败，并主动发起人工交接，向用户提供代理的"思考过程"和失败原因说明。

Result: 原型系统的实证分析表明，该方法显著提高了整体任务成功率，但同时也带来了显著的计算开销增加。

Conclusion: 将人工交接重新定义为增强系统韧性、改善用户体验和建立信任的核心设计特征，而非失败的标志，并讨论了该方法的实践和伦理影响以及未来研究方向。

Abstract: The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly
within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability
challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate
outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a
breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to
address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer
that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,
this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined
set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon
predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human
handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought
process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical
analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly
increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes
with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human
handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that
enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by
providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses
the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key
directions for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用对数障碍函数将基于线性规划的马尔可夫决策过程转化为无约束优化问题的新方法，使梯度下降能够有效求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于线性规划的MDP方法虽然在某些场景（如离线强化学习）中受到关注，但由于其涉及不等式约束优化问题，求解难度较大，使用不如基于Bellman方程的动态规划方法广泛。本文旨在为LP-based MDPs建立更有效实用的理论基础。

Method: 利用不等式约束优化中广泛使用的对数障碍函数，将MDP的LP表述转化为无约束优化问题，从而可以通过梯度下降轻松获得近似解。

Result: 该方法虽然看似简单，但此前缺乏系统的理论解释。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Conclusion: 提出的对数障碍函数方法为LP-based MDPs提供了更实用的求解框架，有望促进该方法在强化学习中的更广泛应用。

Abstract: There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs):
dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP).
Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of
both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based
methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained
attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based
methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained
optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively
compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to
establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more
effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier
function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the
LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This
reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient
descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a
thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been
developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Motivation: 现有方法难以在表示层面平衡全面安全性和细粒度可控性，需要在保持LLM实用性的同时实现稳健的安全对齐

Method: 三阶段框架：1）在理性化数据集上微调LLM建立行为先验；2）训练结构化变分自编码器学习解缠潜表示；3）通过潜空间维度操作实现选择性拒绝行为

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上实验显示安全可控性和响应可解释性显著提升，在Mistral-7B上的跨架构验证证实了方法的通用性

Conclusion: 结构化表示级干预为构建更安全实用的LLM系统提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while
preserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained
controllability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel
three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent
space control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach
begins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both
reasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and
reasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust
behavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.
We then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP
activations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,
attack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to
learn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial
characteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted
manipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective
refusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving
helpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate
significant improvements in both safety controllability and response
interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on
Mistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach,
showing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results
suggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising
pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.

Motivation: 随着企业将云端LLM集成到法律文档工作流中，保护敏感合同信息（如个人身份信息和商业敏感条款）成为关键挑战。

Method: CON-QA框架通过三个阶段运作：语义查询分解和查询感知文档块检索、敏感实体匿名化处理、云端LLM生成匿名化响应并在本地准确重建原始答案。

Result: 经验评估和人工评估证实CON-QA有效维护隐私和实用性，保持答案质量，保留法律条款语义，显著降低隐私风险。

Conclusion: CON-QA展示了在企业级合同文档安全处理方面的实际适用性。

Abstract: As enterprises increasingly integrate cloud-based large language models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini into their legal document workflows,
protecting sensitive contractual information - including Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and commercially sensitive clauses - has emerged
as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid
privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question
answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and
cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i)
semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a
locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive
entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic
coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii)
anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate
reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent
many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce
CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world
CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style
queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments,
confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves
answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly
mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure,
enterprise-level contract documents.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal
angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,
embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint
MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound
significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future
research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.

address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)
framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent
pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors
how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and
accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a
MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician
agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and
human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390
real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs
(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves
primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with
gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on
par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over
physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it
achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,
self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,
and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable
rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a
scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap
between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence emerges from decentralised interactions among simple
agents, enabling collective problem-solving. This study establishes a
theoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in \celeg\ and
reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating how stigmergic signals function as
distributed reward mechanisms. We model engineered nematode swarms performing
foraging tasks, showing that pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror
cross-learning updates, a fundamental RL algorithm. Experimental validation
with data from literature confirms that our model accurately replicates
empirical \celeg\ foraging patterns under static conditions. In dynamic
environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that
hinder adaptation by locking swarms into obsolete choices. Through
computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios, we reveal that
introducing a minority of exploratory agents insensitive to pheromones restores
collective plasticity, enabling rapid task switching. This behavioural
heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing
swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies. Our results demonstrate that
stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes, where
environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment.
By bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics, this work advances
programmable living systems capable of resilient decision-making in volatile
environments.

Conclusion: SAGE框架为自动驾驶系统的安全评估提供了一种高效灵活的场景生成方法，通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety
assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often
constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as
adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be
steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate
tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of
this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a
multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework
named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator
(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between
adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose
hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline
alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard
feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed
model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a
continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating
their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through
the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and
realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving
policies. Project page: https://tongnie.github.io/SAGE/.

Conclusion: 量子启发的保真度方法为提升大语言模型推理轨迹的连贯性提供了有效的基础，证明了结构一致性在增强多步推理能力方面的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent
multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured
logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the
challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior
approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed
method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel
approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The
proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on
diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning
arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the
proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over
supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the
effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning
trace coherence in LLMs.

Motivation: 将静态的多智能体协调转变为动态的、基于能力的协作，通过语义编排和结构化协作来释放异构AI智能体联邦的集体智能。

Method: 结合三个关键创新：语义路由（基于HNSW索引的任务-智能体匹配）、动态任务分解（智能体协作将复杂任务分解为DAG子任务）、智能聚类（将处理相似子任务的智能体分组进行多轮精炼）。

Result: 在HealthBench评估中相比单模型基线提升13倍性能，聚类增强的协作对需要多视角的复杂推理任务特别有效，系统能够水平扩展并保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: 基于MQTT发布-订阅语义构建的FoA框架通过层次化能力匹配和高效索引维护实现亚线性复杂度，证明了语义编排与结构化协作能够有效释放异构AI智能体联邦的集体智能。

Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework
that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven
collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):
machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through
semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and
limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic
routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing
operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task
decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks
into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering
that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for
k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe
semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity
through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.
Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,
with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex
reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally
while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic
orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective
intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few
years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation
environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on
simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that
do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change
prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the
practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often
under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction
through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights
that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical
challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational
constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these
experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar
pipelines.

Conclusion: 该方法在原理上可行，但在语法语义有效性方面存在局限，为基于LLM的CT扫描协议管理提供了明确路径

Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting
acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting
postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and
requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe
an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this
issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist
with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given
in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to
improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent
combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling
abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate
modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that
the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device
compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations
regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API,
and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings
show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol
management in CT imaging.
